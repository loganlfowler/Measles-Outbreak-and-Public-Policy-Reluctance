"It's true. I never died once as a child from smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, or polio. Not from measles, mumps, or rubella - what we called German measles back then. As an adult I haven't died from tuberculosis, influenza, covid, shingles or pneumonia. Because I WAS VACCINATED! 💉"
"I had measles and mumps. When Covid hit, I was vaccinated for EVERYTHING including whooping cough, shingles, mmr shot, pneumonia, flu, covid... I believe in vaccines. I'm 66. Since wearing masks, and we still do, neither of us has gotten a cold. MASKS WORK!! VACCINES WORK!!"
"After reading about measles & immune amnesia (scary), I went for a titer. My measles AND mumps antibodies are undetectable—which seems not to NECESSARILY mean no protection, but might. Then I read this, re: mumps titers & covid severity. Booster, here we go! pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC..."

"It doesn't take a genius to know a vaccine is needed for, measles, rubella, coronavirus, Polio, etc it does, however, take a little bit of smart, not to vote for a moron like Trump. He crashed our economy. The first time around he got people killed during Covid. I mean, how much does it take?"
"This is why you get vaccinated. They work against measles, rubella, small pox, COVID, polio, etc. once your immunity system is compromised to the extent of life threatening you can never get it back. Common sense for most but not for all."

A sobering read. Thank you for posting. There are many in our beloved country who are suffering the same illusions as German citizens of the 1930s. No doubt the scales will fall from their eyes when faced with empty shelves & measles/polio/rubella/mumps/ covid cases throughout the land.

"Exactly. Sadly, I know people got sick from a vax, and hate that anyone would suffer, but they are few and far between. I know people who have suffered horribly from having had the measles, mumps, etc. I was leery with the rush to get the COVID vax, but it was a derivative of other Covid vaxs"

"I had flu+COVID last Saturday, then MMR on Wednesday, because apparently I have no immunity from prior vaccination! Highly recommend getting checked for Measles and Mumps immunity. Most 30-60ishyo are underimmunised. 2 shots came in after 1990, prior was only 1, hence my suprise status!"

MMR and COVID vaccines are like cross reactive on similar proteins. Or at least that was the story in 2021. That could no longer be true but hey now measles and mumps are actually present.
"Today I got a free chest x-ray. A free Measles mumps rubella vaccine. A cheap Covid booster A cheap flu vaccine Last week a free prostate ultrasound and free full bloods. Two sets of meds for two months $25. Wed back to my free GP for the results of the x-ray. USA, you could have had this too."

"So, I had rubella (German measles) when I was 4 months old. At no point, was it EVER suggested that I skip subsequent rubella vax. Public health today needs to stop equating infection w/vax. This whole get measles-or-vax, get COVID-or-no-more-vax etc is penny-wise, pound foolish."

"We had this big former-hippy woo-woo science-skeptic movement already primed in the US, and before Covid the most trouble they tended to make was refusing to use the MMR vaccine on their kids.

My pharmacy told me today I don't need the MMR as I was born before 1957. But I'm getting the Covid booster and RVS. Should I get a Hep B?

"I am RFK Jr's worst nightmare. I just got vaccines for Covid, Shingles, and Tetanus/Diphtheria/Whooping Cough. Also having my blood checked to see if I need an MMR booster. Suck it, dipshit. (Yes, I am feeling it in my shoulder already, but it's worth it.)"
Oh good. They're out of stock on the Shingles. Covid & MMR today.
"This goes to show how important vaccines are. I'm not getting into a debate over flu or covid boosters, because those aren't necessarily needed ALL the time.

Wanting to keep kids up to date with COVID vaccines is being pathologized in the same way and by the same forces as masking was previously. Participating in this project will not improve MMR coverage.
Evidence for a primary series at 6m also strongly favors vaccination given elevated risk for at least 1y. The safety profile of covid vaccines is so good that indirect benefits (transmission reduction) & smaller direct benefits can easily outweigh risks. No evidence covid vax recs affect MMR uptake.

"It's hugely important to recognize that if, under the current regime, this type of warning is being issued, it should be taken very seriously. Please verify if your MMR has expired and get a new series if so. Wear a mask (COVID has an extremely viral new strain on the market). Air out rooms."

"MMR and Covid boosters scheduled. Unfortunately, no local clinics, hospitals, or pharmacies have the newest vaccine for the newest (and frankly, awful) Covid variant. :/ But, a booster is a booster, it's better than nothing at all imo."
I don't know. I think that discussing the benefits of pediatric COVID vaccination without mentioning the reduction in Long COVID is suboptimal. And I don't think the fabulous efficacy of the MMR vaccine somehow makes other vaccines less good.

"Just got my MMR booster, because I was out of antibodies and measles sucks. I usually don't have a bad post vax reaction for stuff like flu and COVID, but I'm wondering if this being a live vaccine if I'm going to be hating life tomorrow. Anyone have experience getting the MMR vax as an adult?"
Absolutely! I got the MMR booster when I was 20 and it happened to be offered in my university campus health centre. I'm actually really excited to be a candidate for an inhaled COVID-19 vaccine trial kicking off next month. Fingers crossed they pick me and I don't get the placebo üòÖ

It's actually a true stat that can be found on the CDC's website. Parents are outraged 3 kids have died of measles with a nationwide MMR vax percentage of over 90% but nobody talks about the dozens of kids that die of Covid each year and our pathetic 12% booster rate. 🤷♀️
"www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/vac... Whoever told you the yearly boosters were ""optional"" we're lying. CDC's own data backs it up. The Covid vax isn't a neutralizing vaccine like the MMR vaccine. It's like a flu shot you get every year to prevent the worst outcomes of infection."

Don't just think about the COVID vaccines. It's clear that ALL vaccines are on the chopping block in the US. Get you boosters of all your other vaccines (if needed and you can) and/or your kids vaxxed now. You know they're going to go after MMR and Tdap/DTap as well.
"I just got another COVID vaccine. My pharmacy says it's fine after 6 months. I also got another MMR, it's been 36 years."

I think everyone of all age & gender groups need vaccines for all potential threats including COVID and MMR but I am fighting craziness with our own public health department. I am 72 and vaccinated for everything other than Ebola and Malaria but no plans to go to Congo. RFK is anti-vax.

"Done. Was lucky to get a Pfizer COVID-19 booster too along with the MMR booster. MMR goes into fatty tissue, so same arm. Only one will be sore tonight, haha. (They're out of Moderna here, if it matters to you.) #COVID19SK"
"And as with COVID-19, reality is even worse than reported: measles damages the immune system so that for several years after a case of measles the person is at much higher risk from other infections."
"#AddToBlacksky #SkyHubüñ§üß° #PutMeOn #Following (pt 1) Damn, people being set on fire, 1100 Measle outbreaks, still lying about covid and giving false info, genocide and murder in Gaza, on Russias side, kidnapping and home invasions, stealing and grifting money, letting drug dealers,"
How about the school with the highest Measle or Covid incidence?
"Should medicines be put on ballots so we can vote for them? If they don't receive a majority, they can be eliminated for everyone. Sounds like a plan, right? We can start with covid boosters and measle vaccines and go from there."
"What happen to ""freedom to choose""? They want parents to be able to choose to give children the measle vaccine but they are taking the choice away to have COVID protection if under the age of 65"
"My body heals very fast, but it also has a strong immune response that attacks things. I had pink measle-like spots for 18 months after my 1st Covid shot because of that. It also sees acetaminophen (Tylenol) as a threat. Fun to be the oddball. Not."
"This is so unfortunate, & sad. The U.S. had measles beat once, but all progress is now slipping away. Also, if you want a Covid shot this year, will you be able to access one, or will it be up to the government to decide who can get one? 🤬 1/2 apnews.com/article/vacc..."

"Whats Anti-vax? I would give my kid a measles shot or polio, but never a covid for flu shot. The covid mRNA shot is worst shot ever invented. The shot should have been cancelled years ago. Only 20% of people are still getting covid shots, are the other 80% anti-vaxers?"

COVID R0=approx 5.7. Mumps is 8 Measles is 18 And Hep.C and Ebola are 2 Transmissibility isn't necessarily the most significant issue.
"These closet satanist need to go back in the closet, PRIDE is not new, LGBQT+ acceptance is decades old, I'm not being dragged back to the dark ages by donkey and his Nazi fascist, where white men rule, people die from polio measles, mumps, covid, scientists are witches, the earth is flat, F THAT"
"Do Not Listen to This druggie !!! Get your vaccinated get your kids vaccinated against the measles, mumps chickenpox, get yourself vaccinated for flu shots, Covid shots, and any other shots that we need. Do you not listen to a druggie who does not have a medical degree it all"
"I'm fully vaccinated for measles- are you and your children? It is free, easy, fast, nearly painless and highly effective. Plus lots of others: covid x7, influenza x19, Hep A, Hep B, tetanus, diptheria, shingles, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, typhoid."
💯 agree! Vaccines work! I'm 61 never had Mumps Measles Polio RSV COVID TB Or anything else I may have forgotten üòÅ
"Measles is a prevtable disease Polio is a preventable disease Covid, whooping cough, mumps etc. I don't see autism as a ""disease"" It's a diagnosis and a small part of who the person is. Nor is it acquired or caught."
"x.com/atrupar/stat... So if u or a loved one is diagnosed with cancer do we call the extra electricians or plumbers?? Hmm. We can thank science for developing the Covid vaccine, measles, mumps and chicken pox vaccines shingles vaccine, heart surgery, MRIs and much more u ignorant person,"
"Was just asked at check-in desk at the doctor if we've had Covid, Measles, Mumps, or Chickenpox in the last two weeks, so that's how Make America Healthy Again is going."
"Be vaccinated for yourself and others. If you haven't had a covid vaccine in the last 12 months, go and get one. Get your flu vaccine Get your measles/mumps/rubella vaccine Just get all the vaccines you can"
"Exactly. Covid viruses don't go away. They might vanish from sight but they still exist in animals. See measles, mumps and such. They can only expand if left unvaccinated. When the majority of humans are vaccinated then there is very little room for these covid viruses to operate. 1/2"
Sooooo In addition to measles mumps rubella and Covid they want us to die from flu ??
"COVID vaccine is free in Canada to anyone. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) is $45 per dose to non residents. You just have to stay at our hotels and eat at our restaurants. Just kidding."
My thoughts exactly. Trying to find the origin of Covid has turned turned into a Bigfoot hunt. We need an RNA vaccine like the ones that wiped out measles and mumps and polio.
"Well it was so lucrative murdering Americans with covid, they're bringing back all the diseases. Flu, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, new strains of covid And likely insider trading on all our deaths. Again."
"To you, covid was a bad cold. Not to everyone, there were over 1 million US deaths alone. People die from measles, and mumps, and even chicken pox (mostly adults as opposed to kids for the latter) too."
"Same. I got the test after all the measles outbreaks a few years ago. Turns out I needed the booster. I hadn't had Covid but had no antibodies for rubella or mumps. Herd immunity was protecting me for who knows how long. Just get one, titers or no...while we all can."
"I wonder if Jeff Bezos will publish a book titled ""The GOP Euthanasia Handbook"" with a forward by RFK Jr? Interesting chapters: Making Ebola work for you!, The Covid Cure for Acne, No one dies from pregnancy- it's natural, Measles, Mumps and Ring Around a posey, and finally- lose that fear of death"
"I got vaccinated for polio, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, smallpox as a kid and I avoided those maladies I am up to date on vaccines for Covid, flu, RSV, pneumonia and I've avoided hospitalization for such Now damaged loony tunes RFK Jr & his anti-vaxx cohort are trying to erase vaccines"

"I'm not saying RFK Jr should be struck down with COVID, Measles, and Mumps all at the same time, but if he did, I would still ask, what's everyone having for dinner tonight?"
"Children do not need the COVID vaccine. Other Vaccines may be required such as mumps, measles and polio which are fully tested over a long period of time. Why do we pump an untested vaccine into babies when it is not required! Over 65s and people with specific conditions absolutely. Optional yes"
I got MMR a few months ago after titers showed my mumps immunity had waned. Just got my second shingles shot (ow). Debating COVID booster since my last one was less than a year ago.
"The thing is, all those cabinet members snd their families - no age constraints - will get the covid boosters, and all vaccinations to protect them from: polio, MMR -measels, mumps, & rubella; whooping cough; TB; pertussis; etc., but they'll tell you not to vax your children."
"Jesus, I cant understand that there are people that still think the covid vax works. IT DOESNT FUCKING WORK! Do you get the polio, measles, mumps, small pox vaccines annually? Thats a NO because those actually fucking work! Anyone that keeps jamming an unproven drug into their system=idiot"
"No we have not taken them for granted. The time tested and proven SAFE AND EFFECTIVE vaccines like polio, measles, mumps, rubella, small pox etc are great. We've pretty much eradicated those diseases from our part of the world. The joke they called the Covid Vaccine, was just that, a joke."
"""You don't know what she would have done"" She promised more ICE agents and less restrictions on them, just like Trump gave them She promised more bombs for Israel, just like Trump gave them ""Covid is a lost cause"" they said that about Polio, Diphtheria, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Smallpox."
"The guy is wasting all the time and money on something that's already been studied, while limiting Covid vaccines to a select group of people. He is incompetent and dangerous.Does he not think autism existed before any vaccines were developed for diseases like measles and mumps?"
"I got one recently. Had measles and mumps as a kid. Never rubella. Yeah, I'm the anti-RFJ Jr. Also, I've never had covid. Go figure."
"Measles, Mumps, COVID, Whooping Cough, Tuberculosis. All spreading unchecked through vulnerable populations. You aren't hearing about it though because RFK wants you to know that you can poison your children with Vitamin A instead. #ThisIsAmerica2025"
"My fervent wish is to see everyone of these fuckers kids get sick with every disease that we can vaccinate against. I want them to get Measles, Whooping Cough, Polio, HPV, COVID, Mumps, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. I no longer have sympathy for them, I hope they destroy the lives of their children."
"It wasn't ""broad Covid-19 vaccine recommendations ... [ that] eroded public trust and caused falling rates for other types of vaccines, too, such as the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine."" Trust was eroded by anti-vaxxers like Kennedy. www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/h..."
"""(Makary and Prasad) also suggested that broad Covid-19 booster recommendations have contributed to declining trust in vaccination, including the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine."" Their speculative claim based on anecdotal evidence seems implausible."
"I may not recover my heart energy but I will recover from measles, mumps, covid, shingles among others. JFC the stupidity is astounding"

"Hey Jack-go check out an old cemetery or two. Look at all the headstones of the babies and kids. They died because of things we now cure or vaccinate for. You know-measles, mumps, rubella, flu and now Covid to name a few."
"E.coli, Measles, Covid, Bird flu, Mumps, Seasonal flu... Make Infectious Disease Great Again!! Congratulations America! Strong work!"
"Or measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis...etc. The only thing I have ever gotten is the chicken pox (in my 20's) and COVID. There wasn't a chicken pox vax yet and I failed to get a COVID vax (my fault)."
"RFK Jr. is NOTHING like his Dad. He is nothing like his Uncle, President Kennedy. The entire Kennedy clan is against his appointment because they know him. RFK Jr. ignores the 1000 measles cases in Texas. Please vaccinate to avoid measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), the flu, and Covid."
"Of course these vaccines do not contian 'aborted foetus debris', This fool Kennedy to talking absolute rubbish. Vaccines have saved lives of millions of people from dying of to many diseases - Measles,Mumps, Rubella, Polio, Diphtheria, TB, Whooping cough, many more diseases and now Covid!"

"It won't be a new pandemic; it'll be all the old ones coming back at once. Diphtheria, measles, mumps, polio, whooping cough, and influenza and COVID, but with no booster shots for COVID, since Non-Dr. Brain-worm doesn't like mRNA. Flu shots for next year are still up in the air."
"I did mine a few months ago. The first shot was no big deal, but the 2nd one a couple months later hit me hard. In addition to shingles, I got my COVID, flu, pneumonia, Hep B, and an MMR booster because I'd lost immunity to rubella (all within a 2-month period)."
"Had titers drawn for MMR because while I had measles, didn't know if I ever got Measles & Rubella vaccines back in the 60s/early 70s (still immune, thank God). Up to date on Tdap & shingles. Have risk factors so hopefully still qualify for COVID vaccine. Anyone know if we get flu shots this year?"
"""It's the Measles/Rubella/COVID/Influenza/Pertussis/Chicken Pox Rapture!"""
"hey, guess what makes ""very sick kids""? measles suppose you have a super healthy kid, then it gets measles then it gets rubella then it gets covid a couple times then it dies to a random seasonal cold, because a all of these diseases ""don't kill the strong"" but also, leave long term damage"
"His life's work was successful, it seems. He's been spreading disinformation/conspiracies about the MMR vax his entire adult life, and the repetitive fearmongering has finally convinced too many parents. The Trump administration discrediting medical professionals/scientists during COVID didn't help."
"Did the same with Covid, flu, MMR, TDAP. I have drug coverage on file and signed in via my account. Will have to check whether they charged me."
"Get your MMR Booster*, shingles shots, COVID-19 booster, and pneumonia shot if you're 50+. *check your titres to see if you're still producing antibodies for measles, mumps, & rubella"
"Right? In MA, rabies vax are required and no one bats an eyelash even though the odds of your pup running into a rabies infested animal is small. But protect your kid from MMR, the flu, covid, etc.? Americans can be weird üò∂"
"I did too. I've always been a flu shot person. Always updated my vaccines. I got all of what you listed, and this year got my MMR, Tdap, and the updated COVID. Heaven help us, because it sure seems like our government isn't!"
"I got every shot available. MMR, Tdap, RSV, over 65 flu, last Covid shot, shingles, pneumonia. If a new Covid makes it to market (which I doubt), I'll get that one too. I'm only missing polio. There's a brain worm heroin addict running the show at HHS. I'm not taking any chances with this guy."
"When I learned that RFK Jr. was going to be HHS secretary, I hot as many boosters as I could: MMR, TDAP, pneumonia, hepatitis A and B, flu, and COVID-19. I worried that his rhetoric would result in fewer people getting vaccinated (resulting in more outbreaks), or he'd make vaccines harder to get."
"Just got an MMR because my last dose was around 1965. When I got my Covid booster, the pharmacist recommended it for that reason alone. And then added, ""never thought I'd be discussing measles in the year 2025."""
"Hey👏👏👏 Now that sounds like a very smart thing to add to Our Constitution!! #Impeachment #VaccinationsWork PLEASE GET THESE..FLU, COVID ( AND BOOSTER) RSV AND HPV ( and Shingles, anything your doc says you need, MMR ) STAY WELL AND STRONG!!️!!️ WE don't want another Pandemic like on his first term"
"And this is what vaccine skepticism has wrought. Additionally, this fam became an unnecessary burden on the health system, in man hours and cost, due to not getting MMR shots. These vaccines (and flu, and Covid, et al) deliver efficiencies, good outcomes, and cost benefits compared to no vax."
"""... In Wyoming, vaccine exemptions have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Meanwhile, the number of Wyoming kindergartners who received the MMR vaccine has ticked down from 97.5% during the 2012-13 school year to 93.5% in 2023-24, according to CDC data. #MMR #ddrm"
"PSA fwiw: at local CVS (PA) DH got TDAP, MMR, Covid and RSV w/out issue. It took forever for them to figure out to bill BCBS but eventually they figured it out. RPh decided on 30 min. observation period (fine) so block additional time."
"Hey, my cousin's Lynda Carter, so... if I survive this week—COVID, MMR, HPV, pneumonia, flu, DTaP shots, plus mycotoxins and massive grief—I want my pink glitter straight jacket, cape to match my red bottoms, and chaos-stopping candle on my fave red velvet cake. 🎂 Please & thank you. lol💉💔💖✨"

"Throw that list in the garbage. Never give a new born kid the hep B shot at birth if mom tests negative. Give you kid the mmr at age 2, not age 1, if no outbreaks in your area. Always do shots one at a time. If kid healthy, never give him a covid or flu shot. Other shots on time, but one at a time"
"?? Kennedy is not saying to not vax your kid. He is saying dont give flu and covid shots to healthy kids. He says wait until kid is 2 or 3 before giving him a MMR shot, if there are no measles outbreaks in your are. Its safer and will work better Says always give shots one at a time Common sense"
"remember when kaiser gave me two covid doses instead of covid and mmr and i had to go back for the mmr? well today after i got my mpox vax the nurse stuck herself with the needle so i have to go back for hep testing, like, what is going on over there"

"Would be negligent of me to forget prob one of the most important ones CDC take over buy a madman who is destroying 100 years of vaccination success with a systematic shut down of the CDC As an impending measles epidemic is looming Get the MMR shot measles, mumps & rubella & A COVID shot"
"That's crazy. I'm in Texas and have been on a revax bender. I have an HDHP and have gotten 6 shots in the last 6 months for zero $. Including mmr, tdap, guardisil (1 & 2) plus 2 I can't recall off the top of my head. Maybe it was covid & flu a in the winter."
WHY?? Just why? I just got an updated Covid booster in Germany. Cost me ~€30 since I am not in their health system. I think I'll get an MMR booster when I'm there next time. It's about €50 or so.
"I just got a MMR and Covid booster for free at a CVS. $1,400 for a necessary childhood vaccine is criminal. That there is any variation in coverage across states is a failure of government."
"I took the first dose (two shots) and got Covid twice. Haven't taken a flu shot or Covid shot since 2021 and have been healthy ever since. The basic vaccines (before the definition was changed) for MMR, polio, etc are good but the fact that kids are getting jabbed 40 times before they are 5 is crazy"
"Remember, @ least the president & the majority in Congress are NOT about saving lives. They don't want to use those silly Covid vaccinations that save lives. Same with the MMR, DTP & all the rest of the vaccinations. Why do you think they're trying to eliminate them? They're trying to eliminate us."
"MMR, flu, Covid-19, shingles last year, up to date on my others. Good for you!"
I asked about hep b! And mmr... waiting on those results. Hope she remembered to put in the order lol. Yeah people do be getting shingles earlier and earlier. She said the age for the shot is 50 but after covid I know a number of youngers who have gotten the shing
I did the exact same thing including the MMR and Covid.
This is why last spring I got both a Covid booster and an MMR booster. Even in my late 60s.
"Have you gotten used to getting your screening colonoscopies & mammograms without paying a dime? What about going to a pharmacy, rolling up your sleeve & getting free flu, COVID, shingles, MMR & tetanus shots? Or your kids' annual checkups?

"Yeah it was easier than covid, flu or MMR vaccines. I felt... A bit dumb for a day or two after, just like doggy and a bit slow but that was really it"
"I got all caught up except polio. I got a flu, Tdap, MMR, the last Covid shot available, 2 doses of shingles, pneumonia. (Not all at once, of course...)"
Already got my MMR re-up a few months ago. Why take any chances. The GenX cusp might be leaving a lot of us more vulnerable than we know. Measles on top of long covid? No thank you
"Said this before but it is absolutely on the table that all vaccines - covid, seasonal flu, MMR, polio, hepatitis, etc. are pulled off the market. Literally no vaccines will be available, or even legal to administer. I don't think this is LIKELY but it is absolutely POSSIBLE."
"Some presentations were handled by Kaiser Permanente. Other CDC divisions also presented and will present tomorrow. Today's presentation were exclusively on COVID-19 and RSV. Tomorrow: Flu, Chikungunya, MMR, Anthrax vaccines. NOTE: AICP's recommendations become U.S. healthcare policy."
"There were a series of presentations made today on COVID-19, the Flu, RSV, Anthrax, Chikungunya (CHIKV) and MMR vaccines. Nothing on MPox. ⚛️RSV: respiratory syncytial virus ⚗️MMR: measles, mumps, and rubella"
"They aren't required to, to be more accurate. I suspect most companies will continue to cover MMR, but things like COVID are less certain. (Until they ban the MMR vaccine for ""causing autism"" of course)."
"This actually isn't as bad as I thought it would be, tbh. They seem relatively uninterested in touching the stove other than maybe Hep B in newborns (dumb) and separating Varicella and MMR (eh. Whatever.) It's mostly a COVID vaccine dunk session, which means mRNA is toast right now as a platform."
"Yep. I heard the argument that ""polio wasn't that bad"" and ""just a cold for most people"" from anti-vaxxer moms a good decade and a half before Covid. And the false MMR autism fears? HPV fears? Anti-vax misinfo has been gaining ground for a long time, going from fringe to RFK, Jr. üò ́"
"I got a MMR booster and Covid booster a couple months ago and survived with minimal discomfort. Maybe when I'm due up for my flu shot, I'll get the shingles booster too. I'd rather be miserable for a couple days than get actual shingles. Friend has had 2 flares due to COVID. No bueno at all."
Mark and I got the MMR and RSV today. Flu and covid shots in August. Nothing else left to get!
"After the election I got two vaccines, TDAP & MMR, also covid booster in March. Started stocking up on paper products, soaps and personal hygiene items in January. Then canned and dry foods in March. I remember my parents talking about rationing during WW2. I've done what I can to be ready."
"That was sheer luck. I knew kids in school who weren't that lucky. At least 1 lost a cousin. There is NO good reason not to get the measles ( Covid, flu, MMR, etc.) vaccine."
"In case you need any encouragement, aside from the COVID-19 vaccine, this year I've also gotten: 'úÖ HPV vaccine 'úÖ Tdap vaccine 'úÖ MMR vaccine"
"Glad you're here; the rising rates of diseases that were essentially eradicated is unnerving. After reviewing with my PCP last week, she said get the MMR booster first, and follow it in July with a Covid booster prior to vacay. The rest are current. We'll revisit any possible changes in the fall."

"I got dose two of HepAB series too. I am now up to date on everything...tdap, MMR, shingles, covid, pneumonia. Not old enough for RSV yet but I'd get it if I could. Fingers crossed we can still get flu vax and updated covid in the fall."
"Seriously, though...when it appeared he'd get confirmed, I went to CVS and asked what vaccines I could get all at once. Settled for Covid+RSV on left, Tdap+pneumonia on right. Two days w/both arms immobilized=worth it. Still need shingles vax & considering MMR, but I guess I'd better hurry."

"Did you know that TODAY is the last day you can leave a comment for the new ACIP - the one RFKJR has stacked full of anti-science/anti-vax folks? Leave a comment here so that they hear we want our kids protected from flu, Covid, HPV, MMR, Polio, etc. www.regulations.gov/commenton/CD... #Vaccines"
Bird flu for one: and the new strains of COVID that keep doing the rounds for another. RFK jr seems intent on stopping development of new flu/covid vaccine subtypes and may even be trying to ban MMR ...
"We got our MMR booster (CDC recommended for those born in 1963), and our 5th Covid booster in March. Not sure they're even still available in the US. 🤷🏻♀️"
"kaiser sure has been attentive since i called about this ü§î i wasnt even mad i got two covid shots, there was a woman in italy who got six at once and was fine, i just wanted my fucking mmr shot lol"
"FWIW, I got a COVID booster recently because I'm afraid of what's coming next. If you don't know if you have enough MMR protection, it's an easy blood test to check for antibodies. If you need an MMR booster, you can usually get it at a local pharmacy (for now)."
"today in kaiser sucks shit: went in for covid and mmr shots, walked out with two covid shots and 0 mmr shots"
"I got covid and flu vaccines last September. Then got a covid booster in March. As a senior citizen I have gotten all the recommened vaccines, including TDAP in November and MMR in January."
"As of March everyone born in 1963 could get the MMR booster. That may have changed since then. Our Covid booster was automatic, no requirements needed."
"I knew this was coming so hubby and I got an MMR booster (we're in the group they recommend, 1963), and our 5th covid booster in March."
"This is me. At 82, I've had them all--Shingrix, MMR, TDAP, RSV, pneumonia, flu and Covid. I mean, why not?? Needless to say, I'm *very* worried about the availability of this coming fall's flu and Covid shots."
"I made anyone who wanted to be near my babies to have flu and up to date Tdap. Of course, this was pre-COVID, and pre Pertussis & MMR resurgence. There's even more reason to be cautious and *ask for the records* now."
"The anti-vaxxers fighting MMR vaccines were doing the same thing over COVID. This has been going on since Andrew Wakefield. This is not helpful. It plays into the anti-vaccine, anti-science opposition. The outbreaks of #measles are because of them."
"I see parents in public spaces all the time with newborns. The dollar store, Walmart, etc. Knowing what I do now, about COVID and with the number of people unvaccinated for MMR that don't fucking care, I'd never take me baby to these places. Massive risk."
I got every vax currently available including a booster MMR before the shitstain got inaugurated. Looks like yearly flu and updated covid may be a thing of the past. I hope we don't end up with yearly pandemics instead of new vaxxes.
"Remember when we required travellers to be Covid vaccinated? Can we do the same for all of Canada and Measles? Sincerely, a parent whose child had an allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine (but still managed to get fully vaccinated) www.cbc.ca/news/canada/..."
"Potentially, but AFAIK only polio, m.meningitus and yellow fever (covid too still I think?) In some places are Required. Most are just recommended, but like... for a good reason. Personally i think MMR should be on that list but still..."
"I'm with you, Covid and MMR in the last few weeks. Up to date on everything else. Encouraging my friends to do the same. I really hope the flu vaccine is allowed (what a shitty sentence to write 🤬)"
Same - COVID booster and MMR a few weeks ago.
"I'll be in the states for two months this summer so I'm getting my usual six month Covid booster, and I'm getting MMR as well. I was born in '73, and Ireland didn't have a national program till 1985. The way things are going in the US, it makes sense to be sure."
"I was told this week that my healthy kidney was operating at 88% efficiency. The same as a 20 yr. I put it down to having, diphtheria, pertussis, smallpox, MMR, tetannus, flu, pneumonia, shingles, covid x5, yellow fever and around 10 others whilst in the RAF. The benefits of vaccines."
I made sure I got the COVID booster and an MMR booster a month or so ago. I will get the Flu update as soon as possible.
"I am 71-years-old. For reasons of autoimmunity, I have had every #COVID shot and booster available. I have also had the Prevnar 20 shot and the MMR shot, as well as my annual flu shots. The way #RFKjr calculates, I should be dead from #vaccination by now. Thankfully these shots have kept me alive."
"We need to look at the good RFK is doing and not just the bad. I just read about his initiative to give all newborns in the US a baby blanket coated in smallpox, MMR, COVID, and every identified flu virus. Heartwarming. 1 in 10 blankets will have rusty tacks coated in tetanus."
"Been told this wk that I am to have a kidney removed, I was also told that my other is working at 88%, efficiency usually seen in a 20 yr old This is after the diptheria polio pertussis MMR vax, about 10 in the RAF, tetanus, shingles pneumonia flu, Covid x4 Result a 20 yr kidney in a 73 yr old man"
"I am boosted for COVID and I can confirm novavax was one of the most well tolerated vaccines I've had in my life. I am thinking MMR and possibly tetanus. I am basically housebound/unable to be in public normally, but when I am out it's at doctor appointments or the ER (which is risky)."
"So, I have all my shots but got my MMR over 50 years ago should I get another dose. Also my last Covid booster(that is number 8 or 9) was in September with the flu shot as well should I get a booster now. I also have benign hypertension that is treated so will I be okay to get one in September?"
"In the past month, I have boosted my TDaP, MMR, COVID, and varicella. 10/10, would boost again in 10 years or so."
"Many of the vaccines are a series, plus vaccines like influenza and COVID have to be boosted annually. Some others like MMR and TDaP are repeated like once every 10 years."
I looked up what my insurance paid over the last year: $957. This has been an unusual year requiring more than usual vaccinations. HEPLISAV-B (Hepatitis B) $151 x 2 = $302 MMR = $98 PREVNAR (Pneumonia) = $260 ADACEL (TDAP) = $62 COMIRNATY (COVID) = $152 FLUBLOK (Influenza)= $83 (2/3)
I'm trying to get a COVID booster. I'm 62 and I'm being denied. I also need an MMR booster. Get your vaccines everyone
"Even if you add flu shots - which can't be *that* prevalent - can you even get to 25 before 18? Is he counting all the boosters? MMR, Chicken Pox, Polio, Dtap, Hepatitis (A +B), COVID Gardasil?"
"Yes, some vaccines are manufactured in Canada (eg. MMR) but no COVID ones (or Shingles) at this time."
"Sure we can. Everyone should get the COVID and flu shots yearly. Kids should get MMR vaccines. And, teenagers should also get vaccinated against HPV. Hope that helps! üòú"
"Please consider all the vaccines that you may need and get them now before they are restricted or not available...like RSV, shingles, pneumonia, DTAP, or MMR, or any others. Covid booster is a must...there is a new strain that has ramped up in China and it is highly contagious."
"My 50th was a big year for vaccines as birthday gifts: the first Covid ones were released a week before the date, then as soon as I could follow up, shingles. In the last year because of the shit world in which we live, I've also re-upped my MMR, TDAP, and pneumonia vaccines."
I updated everything MMR (checked titers first) Polio Covid And got the RSV. Suggest everyone get all that make sense for them.
"So, yearly flu? Yearly covid? Shingles? Pna? Like those? Mmr. Pertussis, polio. Meningitis Hep b We need those and more"
"Get them while you can. Up to date on COVID, flu so far and MMR, they won't give me RSV or pneumonia until I turn 65 next year. Taking care of all my medical health needs now."
Yesterday this 66 yo got both MMR and COVID boosters
"Ask him if the polio, Mmr or Covid vaccine saved lives. Set him straight if he says no and call for his resignation since that's like having the head of NASA say the moon landing is fake. If he says yes, then why is he undermining vaccination at every step"
"Disability advocates have warned about this from day 1. Meanwhile we have a massive pertussis outbreak accelerated in part by people not getting their TDAP, a measles outbreak accelerated in part by people not getting their MMR, and are still in the middle of the ongoing COVID pandemic."
"Of course. I moved on this immediately after the election. Pneumovax, MMR booster, Covid. Was already up to date with Shingles, flu, etc. My GP was patronizing when I expressed concern that vaccines would become unavailable, but scheduled the shots. If you're not up to date, move quickly."
Same here! I just got my shingles and MMR and will hopefully get my next covid booster in August. I am prepared to go to Canada for shots if I have to.
"Thanks for the tip! ☺️ I'd be looking more for Covid or flu, my mom had me get an updated MMR before I went off to university in 2003 so I should be covered with that."
Unlike Covid vaccines I'm not sure a pharmacy can dispense MMR vaccines without a prescription. You may need to visit a walk-in clinic first.
"I got my covid booster (they didn't have anything available for the most recent ""razor blades in throat"" one) and my MMR last week. Waiting another week for Hep A & B, and Tetanus. Got my flu vax a couple months ago."
This was my literal experience last week trying to get (and being denied) my daughters Covid booster as well as advanced second MMR dose. 😮💨
"If you think this is just about the COVID vaccine, or even the MMR vaccine, you're not paying attention. RFKjr's previous comments about there being ""no safe vaccine"" weren't limited to COVID/MMR. Now, neither will his policies. Be clear, people -will- die as a result. (Cue Joni Ernst.) (🎁)"
Getting my tetanus/diptheria today. Got my MMR a couple months ago. No idea what will be happening when I'm due for my COVID booster this fall.
"get immunized for everything. if you have a health care provider, they have a list of what immunizations you've had. get the ones you haven't... hpv, mmr, flu, monkeypox, covid- demand them"
"Well I just got my Covid booster. Had MMR 2 shot series a couple months ago- had same as child in the 69's and yes, adults can get this vax again Had TDAP few months ago Had Flu vax last summer and will do so again this summer Had pneumonia vax and will do so again asap Get them while you can!"
"It's my fault, I'm sorry. Saw my PCP months ago, we decided to update my vax's, got Tdap but she wants titers checked b4 MMR booster, which I failed to do in a timely manner. Then shingles, Prevnar 13, Covid booster, but we were spacing them out to reduce the chance of reaction. I waited too long.😭"
See you all tomorrow I have my appointment at the pharmacy for Covid and flu shots. Will be talking to the pharmacist about any others I may need. Just finished the MMR vax as an adult ( had vax in 60's) had shingles vax too and TDAP Be your own advocate. The time is NOW Goodnight
Takes a cookie (thank you!) and mumbles something about MMR + COVID
North Georgia is full of maga and I was pleasantly surprised to see many signs promoting covid and MMR vaccines while driving around in some very red areas.
"Get your MMR as an adult even if you had it as a child. And get it now. Talk to your pharmacist. Talk to your Dr Get your Covid booster now Again, talk to your pharmacist or Dr Get your shingles vax, flu shot, and any other you may need. We need to be our own advocates. RFK is a psychopath"
Tomorrow morning I'm getting another Covid booster. I recently completed the MMR vax series as an adult Talk to your pharmacist Protect yourself from this criminally unfit administration and the guy who took his kids to swim in shit water. Literally swam n sewer effluent:RFK Ridiculous Fucking Kook
"I am so glad I got my Covid booster yesterday. Now the question is whether to go ahead and get my 2 year old's MMR boosted now instead of when he's 4, if there's any doubt about future availability. I'm so angry, it's unreal. This is just an unmitigated disaster. www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/h..."
Go get your MMR vaccine booster and Covid-19 vaccine while you can.
"2023: ""Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests covid was designed to spare Jews, ..."" www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/... ""The MMR vaccine doesn't contain 'aborted fetus debris', as RFK Jr has claimed. Here's the science"" theconversation.com/the-mmr-vacc... Kennedy=ignorant vile POS."
"Better do it quickly! I got my shingles shot and MMR finally, hurt like hell, but I feel better. I can't get another booster until August, and I sure hope the covid booster is still around. Same with the flu shot.üò≥"
"At a minimum this means no new vaccines will be approved, which likely means no seasonal vaccines-Covid, flu, RSV etc will be available this coming fall. Whether it affects existing vaccines like MMR, TDap, Shingles etc remains an open question. Impossible to overstate how dangerous this is."

"Yes, great advice. I recently got current on tetanus, pneumonia, covid and MMR. I'm older than 65, so it just seemed prudent. I would encourage everyone to do it."
"I just got MMR and COVID vaccines yesterday. I got the former cause titers showed I was no longer immune to mumps, which wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for anti-vaxxers intent on undermining herd immunity."
"Follows up on a previous piece, looking at how the insights apply to the UK context: 'It's a shot, not a vaccine like MMR': A new type of vaccine-specific scepticism on Twitter/X during the COVID-19 pandemic www.sciencedirect.com/science/arti..."
"Definitely. There is no excuse for there not being massive MMR vaccine clinics that are easy to access. This outbreak is massive! Still, masking is protection from infection. We can stop circulating measles, Covid & other airborne diseases. AND keep out wildfire smoke."
"Maybe that's the kind of records they wanna break? More measle cases, more Covid 19 deaths, more preventable weather related deaths!? What will Trump and regime come up with next to kill us? I bet they're celebrating right now, we're #1 in preventable diseases!"
same morons that didnt want the covid vaccine didnt vax their kids.. and just like that measle is back i guess polio will be next
Good for you. it's sure to be a Measle-fest or worse a COVID super spreader event.
"Back in the fall, Smith and her posse announced when COVID vaccine would be available then went silent. Thank you pharmacists for promoting COVID vaccines. Currently an explosion of measle cases in southern AB. Smith caters to the antivax crowd. Pathetic leadership all around followed by chaos."
bsky.app/profile/davi... I sure add one more wing nut to the mix. Measle infections are increasing because of RFK's reckless misinformation rants. Covid hasn't been irradiated either. It is manageable because of vaccines and herd immunity for now. #Anti_vaxers_kill #Vaccines_savelives
"That's why I got a Measles booster, and a Hep A vaccine just in case. I think we can expect there won't be a Flu vaccine this Fall and no Covid vacc updates. And with some states passing egregious laws that mind blowingly make it illegal to offer Covid shots I look for mortalities to surge."
"I see what you are saying re LC not being widely presented as an added reason to receive COVID vacc. For some people (when they know) that is very motivating. Speaking generally, I don't think the evidence shows that's why some parents missed or skipped their kids' measles vaccines in 2020-2025."

"That's what I was finding online in terms of covid vaccines. But in terms of other vaccines, flu, tdap, mmr, (also maybe the new rsv vax?) Canada does have domestic manufacturing unless I'm completely misreading these contract numbers."
"They are building capacity. Not sure how many facilities have actually been completed. From what I can tell from an online browse, Canada makes vax for: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, covid-19, flu, measles (MMR). We used to make polio vax but not sure if currently produced here."
"We won't talk about the runaround that insurance gave me to cover the costs of MMR and COVID vaccines. I'm still angry about that. Let's just say that if you don't want to pay ~$200 per vaccine, you'd better check with insurance ahead of time."
"1. Inactivated (polio, shot not oral) 2. Live-attenuated (nasal flu, MMR) 3. mRNA (SpikeVax) 4. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate (prevnar) 5. Toxoid (tetanus) 6. Viral vector (J&J COVID) 1 and 2 would generally be considered whole virus type. 4 is probably the most common."

"With BSE, HMG said it was 'safe' (wasn't). Then MMR, HMG scientists tried to answer the 'is it safe?' question accurately, which sounded like hedging. I think a lot had been learned by the time of covid but the anti-vax orgs were primed and ready and political leadership was ü§TM"
"Try talking to older people who had measles in the pre MMR days (in my case the 50s) and what happened when pneumonia developed. Close friends and I often refer to my 'dodgy lungs' as a result of the disease and when viruses are flying around how worried I am. Covid, for eg, really scared me."

Yup. My son was born pre-Covid and I remember having some anxiety about a measles case before he'd had his first MMR vaccine. Who knew they were just getting started?
Flu shots are different for various reasons. My frustration specifically these yes is with covid antivaxxers bug the stupidity around the MMR vax that brought measles back
"Not taking any risks: got COVID, flu and MMR vaccines today on my lunch before heading north to help crew a heritage train event. 👨⚕️💉💪✅ (I don't know if most need the MMR, my doc just suggested it for me.

I actually had a MMR when I started the job early 21. They stuck an MMR in one arm and about my 5th Hep B in the other arm (I'm a poor responder to that). They didn't chase for the second and it was the middle of Covid so it didn't get done and when I started this job they checked and I was immune.
"Ideal: finish all vax ≥2–4 weeks before 1st rituximab dose. For naive PCV21 or MMR, give ≥4 weeks ahead. Suggested timeline ( my approach): Week 0: MMR + Tdap + RSV (different arms) Week 2: PCV21 + COVID-19 + Flu"
"I am in my late 50s and I had to get my MMR twice this year alone. I've had ever COVID shot there is to have. Mom is not an anti vaccer so I had all my childhood vaccines. Flu shot ever year. Guess what! No mysterious illnesses. Of course, I'm not famous either."
"Adult needs MMR booster, Tdap, RSV, PCV21 (rc'd past PCV13/PPSV23), Covid-19, and Influenza vax before initiating rituximab therapy this fall. Assuming they start this week, what combo/over how many appts would you do, and how long should they wait to start rituximab. Appreciate your expertise! ❤️"
It makes sense why anti-vaxxers shifted their attention from MMR to Covid in order to win more people over to their views on MMR.
"got mmr, tetanus and latest covid jabs yesterday. today both shoulders ache, and i feel extremely 10-yrs old about the whole thing. i didn't even get a lolly or a cool plaster (candy; bandaid for my north americans). meh. #whinge #moan #grump"
Got an MMR booster (even though they say it's not necessary) and the RSV vaccine just for kicks. Because - #betterlivingthroughscience I hold the pharmacist I'd be back for the Covid & Flu shots soon.
Huge lack of awareness that SARS-COV-2 and Measles are Airborne . Any Covid style mitigations must take this into consideration or fail to protect children. #CovidIsNotOver #Measles #MMR #CovidisAirborne
Misinformation alone doesn't really explain what is going on here. It is likely that the link between COVID-19 and the reduction in MMR vaccinations is also due to the weakening of the health care system that never truly recovered since 2020. We just need more research.
"This is a good starting point but we need way more (qual) research to truly understand the Canadian link between COVID-19 and a reduction in MMR vaccines. Parents, including those in Alberta, often separate seasonal/new vaccines from ones like MMR."
Updated COVID and MMR vaccines achieved!
"""What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.Studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic.In southern Alberta, the # of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly 50% from 2019 to 2024."""
"Same in the US! Took my husband to get an MMR at our local Safeway with no issues (unlike the Covid booster, which was another story entirely)."
I somehow escaped getting either as a kid in the 70s but I was unlucky to get heart damage from Covid. Got my MMR to hopefully reduce the risk of any further damage.
I had measles vaccine at 2yo. Didn't get measles when infectious child at my 4th/5th birthday. Got MMR last year because I want to be sure I don't get measles (or mumps - didn't have mumps vax) and I am concerned Covid may have impacted immune system. Very straightforward to get MMR from NHS GP!
"Since moving to the VA, I no longer do pediatrics, but this question is still valid. My patients ask about if there will be a new COVID-19 booster this fall. They ask if they need an updated MMR, Tdap, and other vaccines. As the federal guidance I relied on gets gutted, my job will get harder."
"I'm not sure what's going on with the NHS vaccine strategy. I'm a huge supporter of vaccines. My dad was blinded by measles as a toddler so my children had the MMR as soon as they could. But then we spend billions on a COVID vaccine but it's almost impossible in the UK to get one, even privately."
"It's much worse than that: Measles R0 12-18 infected from one source. Covid only 1.9-6.5. Let's hope the unvaccinated is forming an orderly queue for the MMR, whilst infecting each other🤷♂️🤦♂️"
"There should be no notion of parental choice re childhood vaccination. I've been around long enough to see the same dangerous nonsense repeated about whooping cough, MMR and Covid. Jab the kids up. www.theguardian.com/society/2025..."
Current regime for full immunity is 2x MMR. I was born on 1974 and had one childhood vaccination for each individually but they topped me up with MMR when I went for a Covid jab (I have actually had 2xMMR to make sure I was fully immunised for all 3).
Got an MMR and a Covid shot today. Whee!
"Guardian newsletter leads today on measles: ""The disease is highly infectious and airborne."" Ring any bells? The vax rate for measles has dropped: ""figures from NHS England show that 3.4 million children under the age of 16 years have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine."" And a Covid vax?"
...were sick should be five or under (MMR is at six months and then at 18). Right? 2025 (this year) -2020 (when the first COVID vaccine was approved here in Canada). THIS IS FORESHADOWING. So I looked and.. erm.. MICHELLE I THINK YOU'RE LYING... of the 1323 Albertans sick with measles 385 are ...
I thought I would be going to the USA in August (turns out I will not but whatever) so I got Covid and Flu shots and I also got an MMR booster - In Australia if you have not been vaccinated against measles it is FREE. If you have (and I had) it's only fifty bucks. WORTH IT.
"I got every single one available after the election including a booster MMR (that one hurt the least of any!) So hopefully I'll only need yearly covid and reg flu from now on, if they keep making them."
"At the recommendation of my GP I had an MMR vaccine top-up about 10 days ago. Failed to clock that side effects can hit up to three weeks later. Hopefully that is why I suddenly feel like hammered poop right now (took a COVID test, which was negative)."
"Reform UK's vaccine scepticism is primarily Covid-19, but the ripple effects are being felt across broader vaccine confidence including MMR. Their rhetoric around ""vaccine harms"" have contributed to a climate of distrust that affects routine vaccinations too."

"Well, just tried to get an MMR and COVID booster, and was told my insurance doesn't cover it. When I called my insurance, they give me TWO options, 30-40 miles away, where they *might* have both vaccines. I'm beyond pissed."
Mumsnet was rife with anti-mmr sentiment well before Covid and inevitably the anti-mmr morons were dead against the vaccines from day one. Murdering arsehole shitgibbons
"A discredited quack said MMR could cause Autism a few years ago well before Covid and uptake went down even after he was discredited but anti-vax loons exacerbated this. The lies persist and this is the consequence. Lots of cases around now but so far this is just the 2nd death, last one in 2023"
"When I went for my private COVID jab, the pharmacist was baffled when I asked if I (born 1983) should have another MMR. She'd 'never heard that before'. that's it, lads, i'm booking one this week"
I'm getting an MMR and shingles Vax this month. Covid and flu in Sept (don't think it's an updated version but I haven't had either in a year)
I was born in 1980. I got an MMR 18 months ago. My GP had told me years before COVID came that I would 'only get a mild case of measles' if I got it (MMR wasn't a thing when I previously got vaccinated). I don't fucking want measles. Especially now.
"If they did, it would be deliberately misinterpreted as evidence, that there are problems with the MMR vaccine & worsen the issue. Besides which, the conspiracists now reject all vaccines as the Covid jab hysteria demonstrated. For the few, who want a single measles jab, private clinics can oblige."
There's also a possibility of Covid impact here as routine clinics were disrupted during the pandemic. I eventually managed to get my MMR last year. Initially GP said I'd be covered by my childhood vaccinations. I pointed out that at 57 I hadn't been given one 🙄
"Btw it is a REALLY GOOD TIME to get your Covid booster, flu shot, and MMR vaccine all while these things are still covered by your insurance thus likely 100% free out-of-pocket, because health insurers follow CDC guidance about what to cover!! And a certain person in charge means that could change!"
My husband got the MMR last month because his first ones were in the 1970s. I had record of getting a second dose in 1980. We are going to Canada in the fall for flu and Covid shots.
"Yes I did get the MMR as a kid because my Mom wanted me to live. And I got a very mild case of measles yet here I am 65 yrs later and still going. Got the polio vaccine too. No iron lung for me. No covid, no flu, no pneumonia cos I got vaccinated. God gave us free will, my mom chose for me to live."
Being told I need to get a MMR vaccination in 2025 is wild. So I go at 10am and am updating my Covid booster before my insurance is done.
"In Canada, pharmacists can provide these common vaccines without a prescription: - Flu - COVID-19 - Pneumococcal - Shingles - Human papillomavirus (HPV) - Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis - Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) - Hepatitis A and B - Meningococcal - Polio - Varicella (chickenpox)"
"I just booked my ""just in case 'cos I'm that age"" MMR shot for this afternoon to make sure I'm covered before this shit is completely out of control. I think I've got everything else updated x waiting on Covid vax release for current strain."
"It's is often said that measles is the most contagious disease, and yet it hasn't caused any big outbreaks like covid. Is this because there is a large (though not large enough) level of vaccination? I got an MMR a few weeks ago just to be on the safe side."
"also, ymmv and always talk to a trusted doctor first, but compared to something like the COVID or shingles shots, MMR is reported as comparatively very easy to tolerate, with minimal side effects in most people."
"I got MMR along with my covid vaccinations last year so am now fully vaccinated. Measles has become more of an issue in recent years with lower vaccination rates so if you can take yourself out of the disease vector running, so much the better."
"Hubby and I have gotten TDAP, MMR, and HepAB boosters within the past year along with our standard flu/covid shots in part thanks to your helpful reminders! (Also this a ping to myself for our 3rd twinrix dose in a few months!)"
I know that his daughter was one of the crazy antivaxxers during COVID but I never have heard Doug say anything about the MMR or any childhood standard vaccines. One person in a family believing one way doesn't mean the whole family thinks that way
"Attention, anyone over 21 , the MMR vaccine loses its effectiveness after 20 years in some people. I got a simple blood test and found out I was not covered anymore. I got a simple booster, it's not like a COVID shot it's injected just under the skin. Protect yourself, they're not going to."
"An appreciation post. For all those who stemmed the tide of COVID with their #vaccinations I enjoy #livemusic again, and so much more. These days are ""a cluster"". But I'm still here loving and living. Get the #MMR! Get the #Shingles shot... do your part and we can all enjoy a healthier future."
"This exact messaging will lead to child deaths, paralyzation, people going blind or deaf, and widespread immune amnesia because parents have started having ""measles parties"" again, like the varicella ""chickenpox parties"" of the 80's and 90's which saw a resurgence during COVID."
"Shame she hasn't been on Question Time or Politics Live around the time Wakefield was struck off, or the COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out or when there have been measles outbreaks. You'd think someone would mention it."
"white Christian nationalists are the furthest thing from real Christianity their a cult of hate bigotry misogyny driven by fear-mongering,unbelievable they had COVID & measle parties & the parents of the child who died measles actually said it was a blessing for him to be called to God's side,"
The same reason they supressed COVID info from the public while telling us to make informed decisions. Declared measle outbreaks would be bad for the economy. Somebody close to Moe should tell him that dead children aren't good for the economy. But he'd just say its good for the funeral businesses
"Concentration camps, kidnappings by masked militants, no due process, measle outbreaks, dengue fever, COVID and no the plague?!! USA is currently a shit hole country."

"I literally owe my life to vaccines. From smallpox to polio to COVID. None of my nieces or nephews suffered mumps, chickenpox, or measles that sometimes killed children of my generation like one of my classmates. This is a crime against humanity."
"Covid is not cured anymore then the HHS has kept away measles, mumps, & rubella, or bubonic plague. Now we have a crackpot ahead of HHS who is making the vaccines unreliable. After killing 1.1 million first Admin, how many do u think they'll kill this time? #BlueCrew #Democrats #Resist #RedCrew"
"It's great that you are using cartoons to make your point; such an endorsement of science and facts. Not like Measles, the Mumps, Meningitis and Yellow Fever are making a return; but MAGAts were never known to believe in science or facts. FYI - COVID claimed over 1 million deaths in the US."
I've had the measles- vaccine introduced when I was 9. I've had the mumps- vaccine introduced when I was 13. I've had COVID-19 (bad case in May 2020) - vaccinated as soon as it was available. Why would anyone choose to not take advantage? Anti-vaxxers are everyone's problem. Science-denying freaks.
"Did you vote for cutting Ed & Meds? #BBBill reduces spending for education, Job Training so people can get better jobs & off govt support.

"Measles, Mumps, diphtheria, Polio, Pneumonia, Covid, Flu, HIV, etc. What did these have in common? They were once either eradicated, minimal or controlled by vaccines. What do they have in common now? They are, or will soon, be increasing & leading to more disease & death. Thank 47 & RFK JR."

"With the HHS, CDC, and various state-level idiots rejecting vaccine regimens, it will get harder to find even basic vaccines (MMR), not to mention Covid, and some insurance companies or Medicaid may think they don't need to cover them anymore. The poor, as usual, will suffer most."
"People, RFK Jr isn't gonna resign, and nobody in Congress is gonna kick him out. The best thing we can do to screw him over, is get vaxxed. For anything.

"Sure, but before covid, we were only in the 80-85% compliance rate on MMR in Seattle public schools on the north end."
Betting he and his kids and grandkids have had full MMR vaccine regimens. Covid and flu as well.
"Multiple times Marshall contradicted himself. He loves the MMR & Polio vaccines, etc. thinks they've saved lives, but doesn't want to mandate them. He said because most Americans have had Covid 5 times, we're immune. Why do we keep getting it then, often with worse symptoms than previous infections?"
"HIDING cases of disease won't make them go away. (as seen by last huge pandemic that Trump tried to downplay costing a million American lives.) SO MAGA PARENTS... as the school year begins and you're not vaccinating your kids, be prepared for MMR and Polio, TB, Covid, etc. Make plans accordingly."
"Here are polls from last week on MMR and Covid. Even those saying the government should make vaccines available or encourage parents to get them arent being asked if *everyone* should get them. So far, RFK is not banning vaccines, only changing recommendations, so hes not seen as a threat to access."
"I got mine at a Wegman's in the Southern tier.I walked right in.They have a big sign that they are immunizing for Covid,flu,MMR, pneumonia, shingles etc . Ages served are from age 3 to elder . Pharmacist told me Hochul had signed the decree to release the vaccines to the public48 hours prior.."
"1. RFK Jr didn't disrupt, he destroyed CDC, lives of those who depended on actual CDC drs, pros 2.

Marshall says the 50+ year old MMR vaccine has saved *thousands* of lives. In the RFKJr hearing he said every American has had Covid *a dozen times* probably. How is this person a doctor? His understanding of math is appalling and terrifying.
That was in the past; neither you nor the old American CDC continued that excellence during the covid-19 pandemic. Please stop pretending you're level-headed and/or that those other men are crazy. Regards from someone injured by childhood MMR vaccines mandated by my country of birth.
Ok let me ask you Covid and flu like this? Because you know all MMR you have to have before you can go to school or most workplaces?
Enroll in school you can get vaccines for free. Doesn't even need to be full time. But I don't know abt COVID as I've only gotten those here. 173 is a lot of money tho. But no I never paid for a vaccine in NYC usually MMR. But if you go abroad & need yellow fever you pay...
"In the past week I got flu, MMR (just in case, since measles is in my area and I couldn't confirm full vaccination), pneumonia, RSV, and COVID. Need to do shingles, check on TDAP, find out more about hep B which is apparently recommended (but I don't seem high risk)."
"Same, except I also have a Medicare Advantage plan. No clue as to if or how that might be affected. But luckily I had several boosters a few months ago, including Covid and MMR. So I'm good for the foreseeable future. 🤞"

"Y'all know COVID torches your immune system, right? Have you noticed how people get sick a lot more often now? That diseases we've pushed to the fringes are coming back? I've had the MMR several times -- no antibodies to measles. What's going around? Measles. Don't do this to other people."

"Covid and RSV yesterday. Then I checked my records so MMR, third in the hepatitis A series and flu because they were out of it yesterday are scheduled for next week. Vaccinations saves lives and money. Just because I can survive these illnesses doesn't mean I want to get them."
"I made an appt at my pharmacy to get just about every vaccine I can this morning. COVID, flu, pneumonia, and I'm old enough to need an MMR update. Probably should get RSV, too, but I figured 4 at once was probably enough. Never thought I'd have to worry about measles, but here we are."
"I got the MMR and the Pfizer Covid-19 a couple of weeks ago, both in the same arm, and was surprised that I didn't have any major issues. The Covid-19 usually lays me up for a day with a really sore arm. This time? Very little issue in any way. Flu shot is next week!"

"Just got covid and flu vaccines at Walgreens, $0 with insurance, only had to self-attest as higher risk for the covid one and the pharmacist didn't ask any questions. This plus Tdap and MMR via my doctor means I've had 4 vaccines in the last ~2 months."
"GOOD LUCK getting those dumb FOCKERS to believe it! STAY SAFE & VACCINATED!! Not sure which you need talk to your DOCTOR!

"If I were certain states I'd consider a vaccine travel requirement. I'm not talking Covid, I'm talking DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), polio, and chickenpox (varicella). No one wants to catch these diseases from non vacinated Florida kids. #vaccine #florida"
"Everyone: Check your local health depts. Uninsured people can get *some* vaccines for a low price. In Florida (at least for now) underinsured/uninsured ppl pay $15 for most vaccines. {But no Covid vax at health dept though.} Flu, Hep A, Hep B, TDAP, HPV, PCV, MenACWY, MMR. Titers are around $35"
"I plan to visit family in Fl. I'm 79 so I just went and got boosters on polio, flu, Covid, MMR on advice from my doctor! This is nuts."
"Interesting. I booked and received my flu, COVID and MMR yesterday, and the pharmacist didn't ask a single question. But I'm in CO, so that helps."
"There's been a measels alert in the county I work in. ü§¶ Thankfully, I got an MMR in March before I went on vacation to Mexico. I get my COVID and Shingles jab next weekend. Vaccines are so important for me, who is immunocompromised due to my chronic inherited conditions."

"Ok so boom. I got 3 shots today, covid, flu, & top up on my MMR. Gave the pharmacist one arm for the double tap. He told me to stand up for the third shot and I, in a panic, asked ""are you gonna give it to me in my butt?"" And reader, he turned the chair around so he could get to my other arm i died"
"100%. Got RSV, gonna push for this fall covid booster, got the two-part shingles vaccine, hep vaccines, checked if given my age (born in 62) I needed an MMR, but doc gave me an antibody test, so I'm good to go!"
I got my flu vax today along with part 1 of Hep B. I'm already up to date on COVID and MMR. (Trying to vax up now on anything I can 😅) The line for COVID at the CVS was long. I'm glad. Worth the wait. Most of them were seniors. 😊
"Darn! Just the opposite 4 us. Got Covid & Flu this wk & they didn't ask any details abt ""high risk"" quals (I just checked ""yes"" for high risk & that was it). But ins won't cover MMR w/o doc referral & for that we have to do titers & doc appt which will cost more $/time than out of pocket for the vax"

"If you haven't had a tetanus shot in 5 to 10 years, your insurance should cover that and there is supposed to be some cross-reactive immunity with COVID. Same for the MMR vaccine. I've gotten boosters for both in addition to the COVID shots."

"Wondering what folks are doing this time around? Getting the shots as soon as you can because of the bullshit or waiting a bit? Last covid vaccine I received was this past January, IIRC. I'm up-to-date on those. Need to get the MMR updated probably."
Nice! I'm scheduled for next week since I have too much going on this weekend. Signed up for MMR along with flu and Covid.
"I played catchup after annual physical: MMR, tDap, flu and dose 1 hep A/B. Two in each arm; just a little soreness from flu shot. Next: dose 2 hep A/B and covid vax. SCIENCE, BABY!!"

"I found this out by accident a few years ago. I came home after I got 4 vaccines (COVID, flu, MMR, & TDaP) & spent the afternoon cleaning my car inside & out (got a big arm workout). I was sure I'd be wrecked from reactions the next day, but other than extra soreness from the MMR, I was fine. 1/2"
All at once? The pharmacist I went to suggested I not mix the shingles with the MMR & Covid shots I got in the spring. Not sure I want to combine the shingles vax with anything. Will prob get the flu & pneumonia ones together...

"Love to get a flu shot and MMR booster and get told that I'm probably better off just getting COVID at this point by a pharmacist Anyway, CVS and Walgreens will have COVID shots in about 2 weeks in NY. If you can't wait, go to CT, VT, NJ; or Ontario/Quebec if that's close."
"OK, still needing a prescription (incoming) but scheduled COVID shot for tomorrow morning. (Also flu & DPT, Shingles and MMR and Pneumonia and RSV all good; ready for cholera and yellow fever once needed)"
"Had my 2nd MMR yesterday (its a dose of 2 shots, a month apart). All done and dusted. A reminder that you can have this at any age. Flu shot and Covid shot booked in for October. No one is going to stop this girl from protecting herself. Still masking in public too 💉😷 #SelfCare #VaccinesSaveLives"
"Before Florida's new vaccine unmandate, polio, tetanus, chicken pox, hepatitis B, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) were the required vaccines. ➡️ Note that NO STATE mandates the covid vaccine. So Florida just passed a law favoring childhood diseases."
"Massachusetts will continue to offer the full range of vaccines recommended by the STATE department of health (which is actually led by a competent doctor) - flu, COVID, MMR, chickenpox, etc - to ANYONE who wants it, regardless of what the federal government says."
"Yesterday, Florida became the first state to move to ELIMINATE ALL VACCINE REQUIREMENTS for public school students! This will end required vaccinations for polio, tetanus, chicken pox, hepatitis B, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). NO STATE mandates the covid vaccine."
Not in the USA! NEVER ANYONE WORSE And His HHS Secretary is at risk of KILLING 1000's of people; including MANY CHILDREN RIGHT NOW! Measles; Covid; MMR vaccinations; any vaccines!
"www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/p... Despite good safety data to date, rational, informed people can disagree re novel COVID mRNA & Viral Vector vaccines with <5 year track record. BUT opposing established MMR, DPT, VZV, HepB etc. vaccines is delusional, irresponsible & dangerous. Really Flipping Krazy Jr."
"The only thing I didn't need was TDAP. Since November I've had MMR, Shingles, Hepatitis A/B, flu (last years), Covid (not the new one), pneumonia, & RSV. Hep A/B is a series of 3 shots and takes 6 months to get all 3. You get some benefit even if you only get 1 or 2. Shingles is a series of 2 shots"
"7/7 Last pt: e.g., here are: a) Pew poll trends (all adults, not just parents) w/ different q wording* www.pewresearch.org/science/2023... b) KFF trends from 2019 & 2022 for parents focused only on MMR* www.kff.org/covid-19/kff... *Neither explicitly mentions exemptions; but med. exemption implied"
"I just got the Hep A/B combo, tetanus & MMR this year. Got an appt for Covid next week."
"Because of *gestures to world* (and in consultation with my physician after my offensively low titers), I'll be adding MMR and varicella pokes to my weekend COVID vax special. If you need me this weekend, no you don't! The cats will be enjoying slightly warmer than normal cuddles."
"Trump and RFK Jr will put all us in danger especially those immunocompromised individuals ( diabetics, cancer/cardiac/renal/ diseases) by banning life-saving vaccines like Covid-19, flu, polio, hepatitis and MMR, etc."
"I get it! I recently got my MMR and flu vaccines. I just need this COVID booster, and I'm set."
I did TDAP a few years ago when a coworker was pregnant and MMR the week after the election. Next on my list are the Hepatitis ones. I'd go for Covid but I'm in FL 😞 might have to do some medical tourism.
"Did HepB and MMR in the spring (routine HepB vaccination wasn't a thing yet when I was a kid and my MMR titers were negative), did flu a couple weeks ago, doing COVID tomorrow. I am up to date on *everything*. (I'm a healthcare student - you'll get kicked out of the program if you aren't)"
Stellar job! I got my Covid a couple months ago and last week I got a flu/MMR/polio combo Just To Be Sure. (Already got my shingles and hep b vaccines earlier this year.)
"I did covid, flu, and mmr booster at the same time last time. Need to do that shingles soon"
"Listening to Bernie's questioning RFK jr today makes me prouder than ever of being a Bernie delegate to Texas Democratic Convention both in 2016 & 2020. As a wild-caught polio survivor, I can't support an HHS secretary whi wants to make polio, COVID, MMR, and DPT deadly again."
"Yes, I went and got my MMR a month ago . The doctor tested me for the disease. Said I needed the measles shot. I got the first of the shingles shot, too. Now, that one hurt . I have to get the other half and Covid and flu."
"I'm 65. This week I received a MMR vaccine. Last week, I received another Pneumonia vaccine. I've had RSV, Shingles, and TDAP shots within the past 5 years. Flu shots every year, along with COVID boosters. I'll be getting those by late October as well. Not taking any chances as I have medical issues"
"Blue state voters: your Dem Governor should stockpile accepted vaccines, incl. Covid and those for childhood diseases (MMR, polio, chicken pox.) and offer to all kids. Schools require them. Pediatricians won't accept new patients from anti-vaxers. Join our ""healthy triumvirate"" - CA, OR, WA."
"Already a measles outbreak in the Toronto Area, 2 days after kids went back to school Pls get the MMR vaxx & wear a mask for the best protection Respirator masks (especially N95s) protect against any airborne virus, including measles & COVID COVID cases are also ⬆️ #COVIDinformed #AirborneAware"
"I got the updated covid, MMR, and flu vaccine today. In Maryland and had no copays with private insurance. I would've preferred to get the flu and covid in late October but who knows what 🧠🪱 will do next to enact eugenics 🤮"
"We got mmr boosters before my uncle's wedding bc he had just had a kidney transplant, and I keep my tdap up to date. Also already got flu & covid for the year. It really fuckin SUCKS having an autoimmune disorder and dealing with all this bullshit."
"I'm 81 years old so grew up without the MMR vaccine, yes I had all those diseases, the Mumps were the worst. Swollen glands and pretty sick. No one today should deny the kids vaccines that are proven to help. I,ve had all the COVID vaccines and still going strong. People Vaccinated your children."
getting my flu & Covid tomorrow! Got RSV and MMR last week!
"FYI: in Missouri I just booked appointments for flu, covid, and shingles vaccine at CVS. I tried Walgreens first (my go-to last December when I got MMR/TDAP boosters) and they said I needed a prescription. Both sites asked if I had a qualifying condition. So I guess I will be visiting CVS next week"
"I'm high risk for COVID and have an autoimmune disorder. So now I'm having to think questions like ""should I ask for a polio vaccine? Should I have MMR boosters done? I wasn't born in the UK - should I have the tuberculosis vaccine?"" I'm gonna have to have COVID boosters, like, forever, but 2/"
"@governor.ca.gov Californians need to hear you say this as well. I am horrified that Covid vaccinations (as well as flu, MMR, etc.) will be denied to all of us 96%ers. Please hold a presser about this."
"Wonder how many vaccinations Mehmet's had. Probably all of them. MMR, polio, TDAP, COVID and some others. Just like the lackeys at Faux News, who argue against vaccinations and yet get them all."
"Senator Doc Marshall of Kansas claims Americans have received 76 vaccinations by the age of 18. That's a blatant lie! I count five vaccinations: three DTP boosters and two MMR. Parents can choose to have their children vaccinated against HPV, influenza, and COVID. 76 is an absurd number!"
"One of the most effective acts of resistance to the Trump admin that you can do right now is to get yourself up-to-date on your vaccines. All of them. Covid, MMR, TDAP, RSV, flu... others depending on age. Check with a medical professional & go get 'em."
"I got that and the pneumococcal and the updated covid. After MMR and flu, I'm going to go for the Hep A/B combo. Thinking about the cholera and TB since I don't know what the environment will be like in the woods where I'll end up running to Canada."
"It's why I got the tdap vaccine last November, mmr in January and covid booster in March. I tried to do what I could to protect myself. Yesterday I read where Florida is dropping vaccine mandates for children. We are going backwards!"
"Senator Doc Marshall of Kansas claims Americans have received 76 vaccinations by the age of 18 That's a blatant lie! I count five vaccinations: three DTP boosters and two MMR. Parents can choose to have their children vaccinated against tetanus, HPV, influenza, and COVID. 76 is an absurd number."
"To hell with this antivax POS freak. I just tried to schedule a Covid booster, and I am unable to get one without a prescription. Bullshit. THIS is why I got all my boosters (incl MMR) back in Feb. Fuck this death cult."
"Fuck this antivax POS. I just tried to schedule a Covid booster, and I am unable to get one without a prescription. Bullshit. THIS is why I got all my boosters (incl MMR) back in Feb. Fuck this death cult."
"Got an MMR shot a couple months ago. Didn't do a titer, just did it anyway. Now it's flu and maybe? Covid shot time."
"Be interesting how to see NC react to this. We're a big medicine and science state, but we also have a very red State House. I don't think we're as insane as FL, but wouldn't shock me if they went along with COVID vaccine bans. If ACIP tries to snipe MMR I think the story's different."
RFKJR made me go into vaccine overload. Covid is the first vaccine I got as an adult. Got my first MMR and Shingles today Saw a list at the pharmacy and there is another 4 I need to get before the administration puts restrictions or eliminates all vaccines I'm Sure there's some risk of overloading
"We did the same back in July when the rumors started, COVID, Hep A/B, & MMR. I think we'll go for the flu and RSV this month if at all possible."
Still getting Covid/Flu/MMR vaccinations in Virginia. Feel so very sorry for the millions in Red States who want vaccinations but can't get them.
I just got My MMR booster and flu shot. Will be getting the Moderna COVID. I guarantee y'all rich folks will still be vaccinating their kids and sending them to college. No matter what that fool in Florida is paid to say.
"One thing that's been pretty consistent in the polling is that COVID vaccines really are treated differently in the general public's mind from MMR/hep B/polio and we should probably keep that in mind, especially because COVID boosters are apparently showing pretty weak efficacy."
Earlier this summer I did Covid/MMR/hep a all in one go and biked home feeling like Hercules at the end of the animated movie when he's full god and glowing.
"Never mind covid vaccine certificates to enter Canada, we need MMR certificates."
"Canadian 'snowbird' retirees better get vax updates before heading down to Florida this winter: MMR, DPT, COVID, 'flu, &c Can we test snowbirds before they return in spring to reduce transmission?!"
"I'm gonna get the MMR, Covid and Flu shots. I don't need to worry about getting sick at my age."
"Shortly after the election, I got every booster I could. If I lived in FL (thank god I don't!), I'd get myself to CVS or Walgreens and get a TDaP booster stat as well as flu, RSV, and Covid if you can. I got an MMR booster, too, after learning I'm in a small window who may not have full immunity."
"So what's their goal? The adults making these anti-vax statements have all most likely had the MMR, polio, covid, smallpox vaccines, but they're good playing with the lives of children. I have a feeling their kids/grandkids will be vaccinated. It's the ""others"" they want to cull from the herd."
"The flu vaccine is updated every year. In normal years. When DOGE doesn't intervene. My doctor is not recommending that I get it this year. I'm over 65 and my doctor has given me many a Covid shot, an MMR, etc. He believes in vaccines. He thinks this year's is not gonna work."
"Most people's reaction is, ""Comparing, say, the MMR childhood vaccine mandate to 'slavery' is a bit much, no?"", but no... ... this guy has referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as, ""the AntiChrist"" so this latest (deadly) nonsense is ENTIRELY consistent with his history as an ignorant religious nutjob."
"Representatives from COVID, Flu, Pneumonia, Hepatitis, HPV, MMR, Tetnus, and Diptheria express their excitement."
"I've had many vaccines. Measles, TB, Rotavirus, Meningitis, MMR, HPV, Td/IPV, MenACWY, SARS-CoV-2. Vaccinations are a personal choice and a moral one, it's ok though I don't mind the anti-vaccination crowd. I won't have to put up with you morons for that long."
That's because covid is a nasty mutating virus. Your body was fighting it . Imagine what the actual illness would do? Yes I did have a reaction to a MMR booster in 2018 and had to take a MONTH off work so yes I know all about it. Would I do it again? Yes because Measles and Mumps are worse
"Thinking of the ""rabies vaccine bait"" and maybe we can put covid or MMR vaccine in street hoagies for the folks who won't get vaccinated?"
"Getting mega-vaxxed today. Flu, COVID, and an MMR booster before I go to measles-ridden Texas in a couple months. My autism will be stronger than ever."
I completely understand. I have been terrified for my granddaughter who is too young for the MMR vaccine. I'm also very worried about COVID.
"Has anyone had an #MMR #vaccine in middle age due to loss of #immunity? I have questions about effects and recovery time. The #covid shots made me feel like death for a week, but shingles, flu, and pneumonia shots were fine."
"üçä(doubtingthomas) has no medical training. Plenty of medical experts vouch for their efficacy. Prove them wrong.Covid vaccines have protected my family since 2020. FACTS MATTER. ALSO,SMALLPOX,MMR ,INFLUENZA ALL WORK."
"Parents/g'parents: 10 yrs ago, 2nd grandson was born in a Kaiser Hospital. We adults could not go in to see him nor to w/out getting our whooping cough vaccine, which we did. I got my RSV vaccine a yr ago due to 4 g'kids. Had 5 covid shots, soon to get annual flu shot. Newborns' older sibs need MMR"
I am old enough to remember how happy our parents were when the polio vaccine came out and we stood in line to get our sugar cube. No MMR vaccine so we had to play with any kids who got measles or chicken pox since they knew it would be worse to get as an adult. I get every Covid update and am fine.
"""The vaccines aren't reliable!"" But again, it'll be fine to get flu shots, or the MMR vaccine... just the COVID shots were a problem for some reason. ""Oh it only affects... certain people, I'm fine!"" Because diseases famously respect street boundaries or state lines, yes."
"Imagining the back alley drug deals of the future: ""Hey, man, you got the vax?"" I gots the COVID, the flu, the MMR, all the good stuff from Canada. ""You got that mRNA AIDS?"" My man! You know it! That mRNA shit is poppin' all over. ""How bout some weed?"" Weed? Shit, I look like a store to you?"
"I got shingles, covid, pneumonia and mmr - two in each arm. Early in the day, then went home and went to bed...for two days. Second shingles wasn't nearly as bad, but I allowed extra time after the first one"
"I am due for an MMR booster and am having COVID, 'flu and RSV vaccines at a pharmacy on the mainland next weekend. Gimme the shots!"
"10/ In mid-September, CDC's vaccine advisory committee will revisit the newborn hepatitis B dose, infant RSV protection, COVID shots for healthy kids & young adults, & the combined MMR-V. Revisiting these in the absence of new, credible scientific evidence unprecedented."
"Okay so I'll be outta commission for a couple days, with RFK taking away vaccines, I'm going to go today and take this years moderna covid shots, pneumonia,Flu vaccines and any other vaccines I can take. Hell maybe I'll take MMR again. I'm immunocompromised Ill need it for years to come..."
"I've started a vaccine search - early - but still Too Early in season to Find flu , pneumonia and covid shots . MMR , diphtheria, Hep B and shingles are available"
It's also the only reason we still have access to the pertussis vaccine at all: that was the former favorite target of antivaxxers before the MMR and COVID vaccines.
Why are online anti-vaxxers conflating Covid & MMR theories against immunisation believed over WHO advocating 95% take-up for herd immunity? No main childhood vaccines in England reached target last year & uptake for Whooping Cough vaccine for pregnant women now 72.6% www.bbc.co.uk/news/article...
"Your faith is misplaced, given how professional organizations, doctors nurses etc just gave up on COVID mitigations. Hopefully they will be more committed to the MMR."
"Healthcare workers should be vaccinated against Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap), Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR), Hepatitis B, Varicella (chickenpox), and annually for seasonal Influenza. The COVID-19 vaccine is also recommended, especially for those with potential patient contact"
"I was an unvaccinated child. I didn't start getting my vaxx's until covid came around about 50. I can say I am brighter and more engaged after getting vaxx'ed. Finished polio, MMR, and all my covids! RFK can go get fucked!"
Get your flu and Covid vaccines now. Get titers to see if you need a MMR booster. Mask.
"MMR, Flu & old Covid last month. When the new booster is available, GIMME! Why arent we talking about the HIV vaccine that the US seems to be ignoring?"
"It was interesting that the other four vaccines were easily obtained. I'm 57, and an MMR booster was recommended due to the outbreak. All in all, I got: Flu RSV Pneumonia HepB MMR Tdap If I can prevent it, I'll try. Covid vax isn't available yet, but even my pharmacist was surprised at the denial."
I knew it was coming. I got an MMR booster & a shingles vax earlier this year. I was waiting on the latest COVID vax update that is due out mid September. Too slow.. I'm going to go ahead & get my rsv & flu before they are not covered Fucking worm brain heroin addled non medically trained fuck.
"I got my COVID, MMR,Tdap and Shingles at Walgreens. They were great."
"I listened to a very interesting conversation with Dr. Malone and Dr. Bridle on #NPR. Subject was Brainworm Jr and his disinformation campaign about vaccines, including Covid, MMR. Most concerning was the expected tactics to kill the whole vaccine industry in this country. Scary shit, folks!"
"Can't have this being a ""faith"" or ""free speech"" issue either, it's just not cricket...y'know? MMR is in decline because of myths and scare stories getting spewed all over, Covid vaccines are now next to impossible to get on the NHS too. JCVI has cranks embedded in it, Labour need to get them out"
Got signed up to get my COVID jab along with flu and MMR because I hate antivaxxers who have let measles come back
"Jabbed today with flu & MMR vax! Had the very best nurse. ❤️ Hope to get Covid as soon as the new one arrives, expected by mid- Sept. 🤞🏼 I'm grateful to be able to do this; you might do the same before it becomes more difficult. 🙏🏼"
Getting flu shot & MMR booster tonight; will be getting COVID shots next week (appointment already scheduled). Would be getting COVID shot tonight but we have a moron in charge of the CDC.
"Last year when I turned 50, I started collecting vaxes like they're Pokemons. Covid, flu, shingles, pneumonia, MMR, TDAP. I've got a CVS appointment in two weeks for RSV, latest covid, and flu. My collection is almost complete."
"In November, I got the tdap. January, got mmr. March, covid booster. I have gotten all the vaccines recommened for seniors."
"2) Indeed, the one case of COVID I contracted, at age 62 was mild, which I attribute to the vaccine. As a medical doctor, you are familiar with the benefits of vaccines. I myself grew up before the MMR vaccine, and as a result of getting measles and mumps, have had life long hearing loss."
Ok!! I've been chipping away at the list all year. So far: Hep A/B (3rd dose next week) MMR TdAP Covid (next week)
"I was just at a CVS in PA yesterday asking for a Covid vaccine. They seemed perfectly willing to provide the vaccine but said that they didn't have the latest booster just yet, only last year's. I got a flu and an MMR. Will check back for the Covid."
meets you behind a denny's to slip you some of the good shit* *covid and mmr vaccines
"It's one of the things I feared with the felon being elected. I was pro-active, got a tdap vaccine in November and mmr in January. Also covid booster in March. I have gotten all the recommened vaccines for seniors."
"He will absolutely go after Lexapro and Prozac as hard as he will the COVID and MMR vaccine, and this is just a pretext for him to start."
"We got our flu shots early, and hubby got an MMR booster, just to be sure they'd be available. We wanted to get COVID shots too, but the pharmacist said they don't have any of the new COVID shots and they don't know when (or if) they're going to get them."
"True that. Unfortunately sci fi of Walking Dead will become reality the way things are heading. Covid and MMR are bad enough but next pandemic right around the corner, whether arising in nature or intentionally weaponized"
"All the covid boosters, the OG version of Gardasil, an MMR in my 20s... if he saw me he'd probably faint from the toxicity radiating off me"
"I thought the big debunk of the MMR autism hoax was in 2010? And after than the dems moved away from antivax, and the republicans started becoming much more antivax in the 2014 measles outbreak I really think the transition where vaccines were politicized was in the 2010s, but covid worsened it"
"@msnbc.com what Kennedy is doing is scaring people FROM getting the Covid, Flu, MMR, TETNUS, HEP B...vaccines. I am NOT an anti-vaxer but I may be this year."
"Was going to get an MMR shot tomorrow but there is conflicting info on how long I would have to wait afterward to get additional vaccines, so now it's on hold. (May or may not have to wait a full month to get flu & covid shots after MMR - planning to get those Sept 15th when Mom can get hers so. üôÉ)"
I am 56. Got my Polio 'booster' in January and i got that Vaccination when i was a kid. Got my MMR booster last year. Last week i got my Covid jab again! Flu Shot next week!
"Thank you for everything you said and for everything you did and tried to do. My baby is (was?) supposed to get her covid primary series as soon as she can in 2 weeks. I'm devastated if she can't. And what about MMR, varicella, everything else she needs. I can't believe this."
"RIP your arm. (I'm gonna get mmr and tdap, maybe this Friday after work, then covid in a couple weeks.)"
"Got my immunization appts set up for flu, MMR, and COVID. Gimme those boosters. That's all I've got left for now for good news. Night, y'all."
"I got MMR, RSV and pneumonia vax all at once at my nearby grocery store pharmacy. No questions asked. Zero effects. Had supper when I got home. The new flu and covid vax will be available in two weeks - already in stock at the store. Don't wait!"
"I'm waiting until late September to get my flu shots, but we vaxed everybody in the house for covid last Tuesday, the last day they were widely available. Lucky! Got a TDAP at the health dept in Feb and an MMR at Walmart in March (my measles titers were low, per the health department)."
"If you have depression you qualify as an adult to receive the new covid vaccine. I mean, not to be funny, but that means a whole shit ton of us here on Bluesky automatically qualify, so get your shots next month and get your flu and MMR boosters too if you haven't already."
"I got an updated MMR shot a few months ago. Went to Krogers on Saturday to get flu/covid and the pharmacist told me it wasn't worth it bc they weren't effective against new variants, it was too early for a flu shot, and they didn't have any for this year yet. Very disconcerting!"
"Scheduled flu shot for September. I requested a MMR titer w/ my next blood work appt. in Nov. (born in '79). But I'm most concerned about updated Covid vax access. I was adamant I want one, but my Dr. is even unsure of guidelines. It's madness!"
"Is it stupid that you're going to have to do the Pretextual Condition Dance to get your COVID vaccine? Yes. Did RFK want to pull this, the flu vaccine, and probably MMR off the market entirely and replace them with essential oils? Also yes."
"I re-upped MMR when I saw that it seemed to be cross-effective with COVID protection in a study, and I also just assumed every disease would come back in style. Simply vaxxmaxx."
"They did what vaccines were always intended to do... Prevent infection and transmission, eradicate the virus. MMR and hepatitis vaccines I got were similarly effective. Flu is tricky, but at least most years the strain the vaxx is for is for a strain that is circulating. But Covid vaxx..."
I went into KP last week for a MMR booster and asked about the COVID vaccine. They said it won't be available until mid/late October.
"Covid and flu boosters are no big deal and I even got a MMR vax this year, again easy peasy. Shingrix was not."
"3/ One that fits both genuine vaccine disasters (the Cutter Incident, e.g.) and false panics (re DPT in the 70s; MMR in the 90s to the present; COVID-19 jabs now) into a seemingly continuous record of failure. My goal to both expose and call out such rhetorical fast-and-looseness..."
"I refuse to receive more Covid vaccines because the two I did receive made me extremely scarily ill. The same, although not so dramatically ill, with flu vaccines. However, I've received plenty of others, including several rounds of MMR, DPT, polio, and hepatitis vaccines."
Remember when Jason Kenney was bribing Albertans to get the Covid vaccine by paying them $100? I hope you saved that $100 to pay for it this fall. Perhaps they'd pay parents $50 to Vax their kids for MMR?
I thought the covid vaccine was the worst. Or was it mmr? Or are all vaccines the worst because he's a eugenicist Nazi who wants people to die?
I got Covid and MMR boosters last month because ... gestures broadly.
"I actually got a titer done to check if I needed an MMR, I also paid extra to get the Covid, rsv & pneumonia vaccines at the same time as well as a bunch of other preventative health stuff earlier this year"
"Got vaxxed today - MMR and TDAP. I had an MMR titer run last year and found out I don't have immunity to mumps, so my doc said it'd be fine to get a booster. And I had no idea when the last time I had a TDAP shot was so got that done, too. I'll go back next month for flu and COVID."
"Happy to report I was not charged for my MMR booster. Next up, possibly having to fight for a flu and covid vax. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🙃"
"So glad I opted to get boosters on MMR and Tdap. I'll get my COVID and flu today for this year and then I'll spread the word to my friends. I'll print this out too, tbh! XD Thank you so much for your help Chise!!!"
"My wife and I recently got MMR, DTaP and newest Covid just in case. We're trying to get everything we can for our kids too. These morons trying to kill us in every way they can come up with."
Except that there are children too young to get the MMR vaccine so they are still vulnerable. And why not make that same argument to the women who blocked me who is mad about US people bringing COVID to UK?
"Yes, I am pro vaccines. I think they should be required for travel. The MMR is nearly 100% preventative against the measles, and should be required for travel. The COVID vaccine is not effective at all against transmission, so caring about that but not MMR for travel seems odd."
Great! 6/30/25 3ish weeks before the dentist my son's & I got our Covid booster. Clue me in on why your doc suggested the MMR for you?
"The MMR vaccine is not only universally recognised as a good idea, it usually comes out as top of the ""best buys"" in health, the cost to benefit is absolutely enormous. For COVID, indeed reasonable people / Governments have drawn different conclusions for different groups at different times."
"Seems like a long shot, but: you didn't by any chance substitute ""mRNA vax"" for ""MMR vax""? MMR is measles-mumps-rubella, licensed 1971; the mRNA vax people would be arguing about for children is Moderna's COVID-19 vax. There may be legit arguments there? pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38236136/"
Yeah gonna re-up MMR to be safe and get my annual flu and covid.
"I got every shot available before RFK took office: pneumonia, shingles, RSV, Covid, MMR, Tdap, flu. Still looking for polio. most pharmacies don't carry it. I'm not taking any chances with this clown."
This is currently for COVID-19 but also make sure you're up to date on your MMR and others to be safe!
"Agreed! I got my TDAP, Shingles, Hep B, Covid, RSV started before he took office. I'm now thinking I should get the mmr, mpox, chickenpox, and polio done again. It's been about fifty years on those."
"1. Modern vaccine denialism exists in large part b/c Andrew Wakefield wanted to sell his own measles vaccine, so he ""needed"" to discredit the MMR vaccine. COVID-19 vax denialism also added some racism to the mix, b/c almost everything bad in this country does."
I got MMR and COVID boosters today and now all my joints hurt I already had some pain in my right shoulder and left elbow before this but now it's everywhere Apparently *both* vaccines are known to have this as a side effect So that's fun Maybe I'll do some reading
"So I must pay $100 for my public health care because the Alberta Premier doesn't like the COVID-19 vaccine (or any of them frankly, see our measles situation & the MMR) and I may not even get access to one because I live in Alberta? Thrilled, I tell ya, thrilled. Medical ration cards are next."
Get your vaccine while you can. COVID Flu Pneumonia ( if eligible.) MMR booster if recommended.
"Around here, CVS's website never could cope with NovaVax, and you had to call each store to find whether they had it and what days. You MIGHT be able to get whichever COVID vax they have as a walk-in, though; that's also how they handle MMR, Tdap, flu, etc."
"What has this got to do with Andrew Wakefield's lies about MMR? That's right , absolutely nothing. He has done untold damage including deaths and life changing injuries due to measles and Covid infections."
And very worrying that wormbrain hates Gardasil - I expect it will be restricted like MMR and COVID-19 vaccines.
"Like sorry but I'm still mad. How dare they claim to be ""combating ableism"" while arguing against the COVID vaccine because it ""doesn't prevent enough deaths."" Should we also discard the MMR vaccine because it has a mere 97% rate of conferring immunity to measles? Lying, ableist hacks."
"Seat belts stop death, but you also need to drive safe. The COVID vaccine stops death, but you also need to mask. Masking stops death, but you also need to vaccinate. For an anti-ableism activist, you are sounding suspiciously anti-vaccine. Do you also think the MMR vaccine causes autism?"

"I am 63 years old, and I just had my MMR redone. Had my immunity tested, and I was lacking 2 of them. Have been getting updated COVID until they take those away. And until they take my retiree health insurance away."
I got my MMR too. Need another Covid booster I think.
"Almost there! Some vaccines (MMR, polio, HPV, smallpox) prevent infection outright; others (flu, COVID) mainly prevent severe illness and death. All vaccines build immune memory so the body fights faster."
"I had my internist do the titration thing on my MMR, which showed I still have immunity. Hope they're right! Otherwise, I'm vaxxed to the max -- COVID booster last month, shingles, RSV, pneumonia, and will be getting the flu shot this fall (though god knows how effective it will be)."
"WRONG, the MMR vaccine is broadly sterilizing preventing infection, everyone including the Biden assumed and forced that attitude about the initial run of Covid vaccines to force a return to normal."
I got my MMR in May. Just got my Covid and flu this past Friday. (Flu is going around my nabe right now) Definitely telling my circle to get all the updates that they need
The baby is 7 months old. I'll breathe easy when she gets her mmr vaccine. So damn thankful that she got her covid vaccine.
"Great advice...l got my MMR booster a couple of months ago...just had an RSV...Covid booster @ the end of this week...I'll be getting my flu vaccine earlier than usual, probably mid-September..."
"Just got my MMR booster (Because I live in Texas with anti-vaxx assholes and it's been 50 years since my last one), and my Covid-19 booster vaccines. Still free. Still easy. For now. Stay vaccinated, people, and stay up-to-date on all your boosters!"
Walgreens in my area only has covid vaccines available through wednesday. I need to just get another c19 shot and then get my mmr and tdap at a later date (and possibly monkey+smallpox shot at an even later date) because I need to be able to use my arm for the rest of the week. üòÇ
"Asked about a new Covid vax while getting a barrage of updates (MMR, TDAP, Hep A/B) plus 2025 flu shot last week. Tech said, ""It's not here yet and unfortunately I think that one's going to become an annual shot, like flu."""
"I received my Flu , Covid and even the MMR vaccine yesterday. I trust my pharmacist as well as all the doctors and experts in the medical field. Thank you for advocating sound medical advice and information for us believers"
Get your vaccines now peeps. My local Walgreens pharmacist is my person to make sure I'm up to date. Second shot of Hep B and booster MMR in 4 weeks. Probably a COVID booster too.

"I really appreciate your doing this! My parents, thankfully, had almost all the diseases one could have, except for polio. But they are in their 90's and Dad just got over a mild case of Covid. So we are vigilant about vaccines. I just had my MMR since my first set was before 1965. I had mumps."
"Since last fall, I've gotten several boosters, including COVID-19, pneumonia, MMR, TDAP, hepatitis A and B, and polio. I grew very nervous when I learned that RFK Jr. would be in charge of HHS, and worried that he would meddle with vaccine access."

Can't do them all at once! They offered us pneumonia and Covid together. No thanks. Glad I've apparently had measles (no memory of it) so no MMR.

"But agree, a Lymphocyte/CBC w/ auto diff at minimum - but this isn't even being advised/ordered baseline before MMR boosters are given. Endemic Covid completely changed the immune landscape & this info has yet to trickle down from research into clinical practice."

"Jesus, we have a bleeding measle outbreak in Alberta, which is putting a strain on healthcare. What the hell is going to happen when we have a covid outbreak again in this province. And all of her Maple MAGA separatist nitwits will have a fit if shit gets shut down again. All of this is preventable!"
"Albertan here, we had to register through AHS starting August 11th if we wanted the covid vaccine, and we have to pay for it. We already have a health care crisis here because of the measle outbreak, I can't imagine what it will be like if we have a covid outbreak. We need Avery Haines from W5 here."
"This guy is something else. I was going to repost your comment but lost track of where it was. I believe Covid was a virus...it acted like one, it killed...as in people were diagnosised with and died. That's the proof I take as it being a deadly virus or virus like thing, just like Polio & measle"
"In Alberta, Dani Smith is making us pay for the vaccine. We had to sign up this month to pre-order the covid shot. A lot of people won't get it because they can't afford the cost. She's mishandling the measle outbreak in our province and now covid. I don't know how much more hospitals can take."

Measles is not what I am worried about. Right now I am worried about Polio which is on the upsurge. I have petitioned my doctor urging him to issue me a presciption for Covid booster and check to see if my Polio and mumps invax is still holding. That was 60 yrs ago.
"In the last two months I've had the pneumonia shot, flu shot, Covid booster, and a measles mumps rubella booster as I no longer had antibodies from my childhood immunizations. I could have skipped that last one if the world had not gone insane of late. Just sayin"
"Good for him. The idea of Covid vaccines that don't work for adults being forced on children is just sad. Besides, Covid will presumably end up an endemic childhood disease just like all the others --- measles, mumps, etc., even smallpox when that was around. And surge every five years."
"I think between RFKjr & Ron DeSantis in Florida saying that nobody has to be vaccinated. I think they're trying to kill the people in the US, kids they're not inoculated form all the diseases, mumps, measles, chickenpox typhoid tetanus, all those diseases, Covid flu smallpox"

"Sooner the better. Hopefully from COVID, mumps, measles or anything where a vaccine could have saved him. The Charlatan."
"To anyone who's not caught up on vaccinations, get 'em now! I got a covid booster this morning. Measles, mumps, rubella, TB, polio, all of them - and more - will be back if this continues for much longer. It won't be long until the death rates will rise back to the levels of the early 1900s..."
"Yes, we all had mumps, measles & rubella when I was young. I remember getting the polio vaccination. Now I'm a senior worrying about whether I can protect myself against Covid or the flu in Denial Smith's Alberta."
"You have to vaccinate 5000 kids against measles to stop 1 child dying. 10,000 to stop 1 dying of chicken pox. 15,000-20,000 to stop a death from mumps. With covid there are not just the risks of hospitalization & death but also eg long covid (v expensive for NHS). Vaccines are worth every penny."
"Oh it's just beginning. Get ready for measles, mumps, Covid, scarlet fever, chicken pox, diphtheria, polio. You know, all those fun diseases that we eradicated with vaccines. Thanks to trump and RFK they will be killing all the kids again. It matters who you vote for."
"Science: many studies by critics and supporters alike to get to concensus. GOP: no studies, just opinion, then turn it into science policy. Polio, measles, covid, flu, small pox, chicken pox, mumps, rubella all soon to be epidemic in the US."
"I am a 76 yo who has never had covid thanks to vaccines! Also no polio, rubella, mumps, measles, small pox, not to mention the cocktail of vaccines given to me before being sent over seas in 1968. So they work! Don't listen to idiots even from the White House."
"Apparently masks are only good when they're used to terrorize people. I mean, who amongst us doesn't love a good epidemic or 6. Measles, mumps, rubella, Covid, polio and RSV can't wait. At least they're banning guns. Oh wait...that's only for trans people. 🙄🤬"

Kennedy and Trump have turned the CDC into a radical anti vaccination camp. They are planning to ban common childhood vaccines like the ones for the mumps and measles. Soon we won't be able to get COVID vaccines or for shingles. All based on conspiracy theories and Kennedy fantasies.
"I can recall my mom - a professor of microbiology - explaining mRNA some 40 years ago, and suggesting ""some day"" it might lead to vaccines I got every vaccine available - Measles, mumps and rubella were not among them - I wish they had been I called her the day I got my first modeRNA COVID shot"

Even Cassidy doesn't want them to meet."
"So many people are going to die, not just from COVID, but from many other diseases now. For the simpletons, COVID alone does not kill - it attacks weaknesses in the body and kills that way. Also, No one wants to watch their child go thru Polio, Mumps, Measles, Rubella (aka German Measles)"

Deadly viruses which can kill, not just you, but others if you do not get vaccinated and spread it."
"Did you die from COVID-19? Ever had polio? Or smallpox? Have your kids had tuberculosis? How about measles, mumps or rubella? Has typhoid skipped you? Do you know anyone who had diphtheria? The only way you get to turn your nose up at vaccines is if the rest of us are allowed to get them. #maga"

Also reminder that there's evidence of COVID doing the same! I had to get a titre for MMR and it turned out that I needed a booster!
"In the past year I've taken the vaccines for Covid, Flu, MMR, Pneumonia, Shingles, and TDAP. Planning on going ahead and getting vaccines for Hep A&B and RSV soon. Gonna have all the antibodies they'll let me get!"
"As a near-senior, in the last few months I've gotten COVID, MMR, pneumococcal, flu, shingles, and RSV. Probably closer together than I should but suffered no ill effects at all. Get your jabs."
"We saw the writing on the wall and my family is FULLY VAXXED! Chickenpox, MMR booster, flu, Covid, alllll the things. www.npr.org/2025/10/06/n..."
So they're pulling even more support for the COVID shot and are putting muscle behind trying to make MMR three separate shots. Why? Because they hope it'll make kids get fewer of them if it takes three separate trips. They want your kids sick or dead.
"So it essentially means people have to pay for a doctor appointment to get authorization to get a Covid shot. AND now toddlers will have to get three separate jabs instead of one MMR shot, on the sage advice of fake Dr. Trump."
"I received the Covid, flu and MMR vaccines at the same time in September . Living on the edge :)"

"COVID-19 is not great, but if they're not requiring prescriptions, I don't think its going to change dramatically. Splitting MMRV into MMR and V is something that most pediatricians do before 4 anyways because of the risk of seizures."
"Don't let our society's worst people get you sick. Get the updated covid vaccine; it's effective against the newest mutations. Get a TDAP. If you're over 40, ask about an MMR booster. If you're over 50, get varicella/shingles. You might have to demand them. But they have them."
If you're a gen X or millennial who hasn't gotten their 2nd MMR dose (or you aren't sure) make arrangements to do so Seriously. You can't tell who is immunocompromised just by looking (or who has loved ones at home who are) Remember early Covid contact tracing? We're all so connected.
Also if you're 50ish it's worth checking which vaccine you had and getting mmr if it was the old one or your records don't say. I can attest that the mmr one doesn't hurt and gave me no after effects (the covid and flu ones tend to give me a sore arm and a bit of a headache by comparison)
"My DIL, a critical care nurse, wouldn't let anyone near my granddaughter until they were fully (re)vaccinated, including COVID and flu. I renewed my MMR and TDAP."

"Thanks for the reminder! I just got Covid and flu and think my doctor gave MMR some years ago but can't recall. I know I had mumps and chicken pox! And shingles, so then I got vaxxed to the max cause that's the pits."

"I got MMR and flu but I need to get my second shingles vax and I'm not looking forward to that one. My doc was out of Covid vax last time I was there. MMR and flu the same day had me dragging over that weekend, but shingles 1 kicked my ass and I've heard the second one can be worse!"
MMR arm is fine. COVID/flu arm is going through some things. Will be sleeping mostly on my right tonight.
"Huzzah! I did the same + RSV (COVID, flu, and RSV together and MMR separately last month!) I also mask because people are stupid and yucky!"
"I did Covid, HPV, and MMR all at once a few months ago. Knocked me flat for two days, but worth it."
"I think I remember MMR hurting like a bad wasp sting? The Covid one kicked my ASS this year, flu was nothing."

"I'm heading to the health department to do the same. We got vaxxed up to move out of the country for a couple of years, but were back and I'm eligible for at least two related to my age. I need COVID and am going to also request the MMR booster and an early Tdap booster."
"I got an MMR, pneumonia, flu and Covid vax. I'd do RSV but I'm not 75 or immunocompromised."
I've been loading up since January. Shingles. MMR. Flu. Covid boosters. Whatever they will give me.
"As soon as I recover from the Covid and flu vaccines, I'm going in for pneumonia and MMR."
Got my MMR and pneumococcal six weeks ago. Covid and flu yesterday. May have another couple next month. Trying to give my body a fighting chance in the pro-virus society.
"I say 'ready to mask yet?' because the rise in deadly and debilitating diseases is a result of letting Covid run rampant, weakening immune systems, allowing more viruses to infect, spread, reemerge from eradication. Masking curbs Covid spread. A fitted N95 also prevents measles until you get MMR vax"
"Yup. Flu, nu-COVID, and MMR."
"Here's the best way to say #fuckyou to #rfkjr ... Get vaccinated! Whether it's influenza, COVID-19, RSV, MPOX, Pneumonia, TDaP, MMR, Meningitis, Hepatitis A&B, Shingles, Polio, Chickenpox. If travelling Typhoid, Rabies, Cholera, Japanese Encephalitis, Tick-borne Encephalitis, or Chikungunya."

"Hell yes vaccines, i gotta get my MMR and HPV (and flu and covid) soon Also on titor; all i can find is it's a tree of some kind?"
I got COVID/flu/ MMR 2 weeks ago and had 102 temp for about 40 hours and broke out in a rash that looked a like Measles for a few days. Still totally worth it. People are dropping like flies around our area and no one is even aware of how high the numbers are.

I had measles as a kid. Before the vaccine. I got the MMR vaccine a year ago to travel internationally. One dose. Had to fight for it. Not chancing that Covid may have wiped out acquired immunity.
"I was able to get the MMR shot at Walgreens despite having had it in the early 90s. Got Covid & flu boosters at the same time. Basically went in and said ""give me every vaccine you're legally allowed to."" Def recommend everyone do the same if they can (I know cost & autoimmune are barriers for some)"
"I'm not afraid of vaccines in general for myself. But I can get pretty sick from them. I had the MMR shot at 16 and it took me out for 2 weeks. Novavax caused inflammation and blood clots in me for a month. I don't react poorly to the Pfizer/moderna covid shots, just crappy for a day."
"Not sure you meant to respond to me? I'm disagreeing with the person you were disagreeing with I will say though that covid and covid vaccine both present a distinct myocarditis risk beyond just routine stress on the body MMR is not known to cause myocarditis, for example"
"I recently received my Flu, Covid, MMR and Tdap boosters. I haven't felt the need to have the MMR or Tdap vaccines updated since I was a child. I'm now in my 70s. Why? Because children were getting vaccinated nationwide, and the diseases were rarely seen. Not now."

"Hell, it's more expensive to do the blood test to see if you need additional mmr than it is to just pay for vaccine. Guess Im getting another mmr vaccine. Along w flu.

"If you're going to Twitchcon, now is a good time to get updated COVID and Flu shots! Heck, people are likely coming in from Texas, so maybe even a new MMR would be smart! 💕💕💕"
Got a covid booster because... science. Got an MMR booster because... America.

"definitely getting ones for covid, flu, and an mmr booster, we'll see if I can do more than that lol"
I agree up to a point but the way the MMR story played out says otherwise. It was interesting the way that Covid-vax scepticism polarised this issue differently to MMR tho.
"Perhaps an even more crucial body is JCVI. JCVI status as an advisory body is underpinned in law. It *must* respond to questions asked by Sec of Health - so e.g. should a Sec of Health ask about MMR and autism, or covid vax and cancer... 6/11"
I mean I've been in hell for two days but that's because I got my Covid/flu/MMR boosters so idk if that qualifies
"got Covid, Flu, MMR, and RSV all at once at Walgreens last week. Chicago Wag's. Frictionless."
"Except that he told me MMR was all that was needed to prevent Covid, and also I shouldn't have allowed my kids to be vaccinated. Whatever, dude."
"So walking home with my son after his MMR shot I was explaining how vaccines work and the selfishness of the deniers. I told him about the Ivermectin belief in regards to COVID. My 9 yo stopped in his tracks, 'that's silly.' Some days there is hope."
"that's a real thing tho, but I forget the details. basically any vaccine puts the immune system on above normal alert I think was the hypothesis, and there's evidence of lower covid infections soon after mmr I think?"
"Vaxxed the hell out of myself today: flu, Covid, MMR"
"Well, maybe I should have split the vaccines up into 2 at a time instead of 4 at once. I have a fever, probably from the MMR or Tdap and an extremely sore left arm from the Covid vax. I am going to bed. Hope I feel better tomorrow. Hope you all are staying safe and doing OK."
"The right wing homestead grifters in my hometown suddenly all have Tylenol stories when before it was MMR stories and before that it was COVID stories. It's almost like they all lie and follow the same playbook to push their fake ""cures"""
"Perversely, the way you know this is all a sham is that every RFK Jr crackpot change so far is at the margins. He KNOWS what his own antivax following really wants - an end to MMR, dtap, rotavirus, covid vaccines, vitamin k, etc. But he can't give it to them without risking a bunch of dead babies"
"But my old OBGYN told me the MMR vaccine would protect me from Covid! How can it be bad when it helps against Covid??? No joke, that's what he told me. Then I couldn't get test results for 3 weeks because he was out with Covid."
"so Tylenol supposedly causes autism, but so does MMR, despite autism predating either of them – how could this be? negativity bias! this is why when ppl consider something to be ""bad"" they can invent hundreds of causes w/little evidence & ppl will believe it... juliaserano.medium.com/what-covid-l..."
Tylenol doesn't cause autism. The 'R' in MMR is rubella. Please don't take advice from the man that told you to drink bleach and ivermectin if you had COVID-19.
"I was at #Walgreens picking up a script today & saw that the MMR, HPV & meningococcal Vax aren't available. Just struck out with ink like it was nothing... Should duck into #CVS to see if it's the same. Can't wait to fight for COVID shots for me & my daughter with MS. Wtf is our country ?"
"Dr Trump, who back in 2020 suggested we should drink bleach to protect us from Covid, is now giving MMR Vaccine advice on 'what he feels'!"
"They won't even make the COVID or MMR vaccines available. They dont care about Strep B! We're all just burdens to society to be used, kept weak, and die when we are no longer useful. I want to believe in Science, but when more than half of all Americans vote for crimson creosote, I don't know."
"Getting vaxxed today for flu, covid, DPT and MMR because my titers are low for MMR and DP & I'm due for tetanus anyway."
I wouldn't be surprised if it's along the lines of his musings about Covid testing: don't diagnose autism and it magically goes away... Possibly also disallow pregnant people from taking Tylenol and don't give infants the MMR vaccine (courtesy of üí© Andrew Wakefield üí©) üôÑ
COVID booster achieved! Also spoke to my doc about the MMR and she met me 1/2 way. We're going to test my antibodies and then determine if I need another shot or not.
"I just got an updated MMR booster, a COVID and a flu shot here in central California at a cvs. It was easy and, at least for me, no side affects at all."
My wrap-up story on Friday's chaotic ACIP meeting for @medscape.com #Medsky #IDsky #pediatrics #infectiousdisease #vaccines #COVID #MMR #MMRV #hepatitisB #geriatrics #obgyn
"Is one of these you? No. This is all of us. Tomorrow is the rapture. It's important to get enough sleep before the rapture. Take a nap. Also, make sure you get your vaccines. Heaven has vaccine requirements including Covid and flu, MMR, Pneumonia, shingles (depending on your age), and DipTet."
"Sep 19-22 poll of 9,257 U.S. adults (+/-2.1%) % of U.S. adults who say that for most of each group, when getting this vaccine the benefits [outweigh the risks | are outweighed by the risks] The COVID vaccine for U.S. adults 41% | 24% MMR for children 61% | 12% today.yougov.com/topics/healt..."
I did MMR a week after Covid. 1963 was a long time ago!
"So I think I'm all topped off on vaccinations now. Covid, flu, pneumonia, MMR. Can't get RSV yet, as far as I can tell. What else ya got?"
"The maternal mortality rate, or MMR, has been rising since then, with a combination of factors including Taliban rule, Covid, and especially the sudden reduction in access to skilled HCW and treatment facilities to prevent the top MMR causes- hemorrhage, sepsis, pre/eclampsia, obstructed labor..."
"Thank you. We'll get COVID + Flu shots at pharmacy in Kansas, same one we went to earlier in year for MMR booster (for people originally vaxxed mid 1960s). They were doing a lot of MMR boosters for Missourians when we were there."
Had the MMR earlier in the year - no problem. Had the flu shot and Covid booster on Thursday. No problem.
"Vaccines save lives #GetVaccinated #MMR #Covid #Polio #Influenza And, any other vaccine that is typically required for seniors, babies, school-aged children. The benefits far out weigh the risks."
"I'm old enough to have had the childhood viruses, I had the whole bunch of public vaccinations everyone used to get including Polio. I've had backup MMR, and then COVID, flu (regularly), RSV, Pneumonia and Shingles. I think I'm ok. Stupid people can just enjoy the consequences of their stupidity!"
"Got Covid jab, flu shot and MMR today. They told me to come back for tetanus and HPV. I said um ain't HPV just for teens and whatever? They said no, now it's recommended for under 45. Check with your doctor. Either way, I feel 👍🏿 Normally get Moderna but they only had Pfizer. Hope it's the same."
"Flu, Covid, Shingles, MMR. Going back for pneumonia and RSV on Tuesday."
"All vaccines, whole family & flu shot every year since 5 yrs old. Honduras required proof of measles shot to return to US this year. Had to get an MMR as records didn't exist for me. COVID vax multiple times for me & the family. RFK Jr is a nut case."
"The new vaccine committee on a whole clearly doesn't understand what public health is, doesn't get many people have difficulty getting into primary care for a prescription for a vaccine, doctors already make the recommendation to separate mmr from v, the risks and cost associated with covid..."
"We got the flu, Covid Shingles MMR. My whole family did. They have whooping cough measles and something else in Florida now ."
"I got my Fall Covid booster and Flu vax last week. No questions/issues from the pharmacy (CVS), Completely paid for by my State (CA). I got my MMR booster and Shingles vax at the suggestion of my doctor (I am 62). In all my varied Covid, flu shots over the years, no reactions. I don't glow at night!"
and me and me! I'm collecting every covid vaccine. it's so cool!!! it's so much better than the disease and I've had that too! Now I'm psyched to go get an MMR at 62 years of age and pretty much any other vaccine I can get my hands on.
"Me. 69 get a Covid vaccine every 6 months and dodged getting the virus for 4.5 years before I got my first bout, lasted about 5 days and was back to work with no long Covid symptoms. That was a year ago. I have the shingles and pneumonia vaccines, and got a MMR booster last May. Vaccines save lives"
"As a matter of fact, Dec. of last year I got my MMR booster, Tdap, Hep B, Shingles, Pertussis, Flu & COVID booster all within 2 weeks with a sore arm being the only side effect. Second Shingles brought only a sore arm."
I have had every vaccine & booster. Yesterday I had the new COVID and flu vaccine. No arm pain & nothing today. Had the summer COVID booster. I had pneumonia vaccine last year. I had the RSV last year too. I have had the shingles vaccine. I am going to talk about the MMR at my next checkup.
"Before anyone comes at me - I AM A NURSE THAT BELIEVES IN SCIENCE. MMR Booster = nothing Tetanus and Flu on Wed. = not even the typical sore arm after Tetnus. Covid and RSV yesterday = arms not sore. Some achy joints, big improvement over other Covid vx I've had. Could be from the RSV..."
"I got the COVID, Flu and MMR vaccines last weekend with only feeling tired for a day as a side effect. Great trade off for not getting sick for a week or more!"
"I have, many, w/no problems. Just had the latest Covid shot. My arm was a little sore, very little, for a couple of days. Also had an MMR bc I was not sure if I ever really had it. And I know the vaccines between '63 and '67 for measles was not that good. So I decided to get it now. Just in case."
"Two weeks ago got my updated Covid, flu, and pneumonia vaccines. Pretty fatigued the next day but nothing crazy. Yesterday updated TDap and first Shingrix. My arm was sore but otherwise fine. MMR is next."
🙋♀️🙋♀️ Me I've had everything from MMR to polio to Flu and all my Covid shots!! My parents didn't raised no dummies..all 5 of us went to our Pediatrician religiously and we never ever questioned the doctor or scientists!!
I have had every Covid shot and booster. Since the MMR vaccine did not exist when I was a kid I had a titer test to make sure I had immunities. I have also participated in flu and RSV vaccine studies. Other than a few aches and pains for about 12 hours after the shots no issues. No Covid ever.
Since I came from a time before MMR vaccines I had the titer test to make sure I was immune for measles (living in Florida I can't be too confident). I have not had Covid ever.
"All of them, including shingles, an updated MMR, and this year's Flu and Covid shots (Thank you, NJ Department of Health). I live with someone who is immune compromised and will do everything possible to protect his health as well as my own. He had shingles once and it was pretty awful."
I had the MMR and COVID shots in the same arm and was sore for weeks That said MMR is a live vaccine so it might have just been that
I just got an MMR booster in my 50's because with this crazy measles outbreak my doctor recommended the booster since efficacy can weaken over the decades. Zero side effects. Got the shingles while I was there. Trying to get another COVID booster next.
"Flu and Covid coming up Monday morning. Have had ALL of the Covid boosters. I'm a retired nurse, so over many years I've had more than I can count. Flu, tb, hep b, MMR, tetanus, shingles-you name it. Never more than a sore arm."
"I have! I'm all caught up on Pneumonia, Shingrix, MMR, TDaP, RSV (2024 only per my PCP). Per my doctor, I obtained my flu shot and COVID vaccination this week."
"Yep, all of them, even a second MMR though I'm 79. Second shingles coming up this month along with flu and Covid (now that it's available without a prescription). NO side effects at all."
"I do right now. Covid, shingles 1 and 2, flu, and pneumonia. Oh and MMR."
I had my titers tested... the test said my titers were up so I don't need to repeat MMR ... thank goodness 😅 I have to take the covid shot the RSV shot the tetanus shot pneumonia shot flu shot shingles shot that's a lot... as I'm immunocompromised... ugh 😣
"These early shifts—less COVID vaccination; fewer options for flu, MMR, and chickenpox vaccines—may seem benign enough. Kennedy and his allies are testing the waters, but they're also accustoming the public both to the idea of fewer vaccines and to the routine of doubting vetted immunizations."
Good luck persuading your doctor! I am unfortunately allergic to the flu shot??? but I did recently get the new covid vaccine and the MMR. I saw a recommendation somewhere to get the MMR vaccine as an adult unless you are 100% sure you got two doses of it in childhood
"This is just more of ""you do you"" and ""masking is a choice"". They're starting with the COVID vaccine ""choice"" and then it'll be MMR, polio,... They won't stop because they're looking to achieve full eugenics."
"Today at lunch, I got my flu shot, H got her MMR booster and we plus Dad all got our COVID shots. We are up to date! (Except me, technically, as I can't get the TDaP anymore. üòî)"
"Vaccine day. They said, I see there's a few you are due for if you want them. Uh, yeah. I'm not a fan of Kennedy killing germs, thanks. I got vaccines for: flu, pneumonia, shingles, Hep B, and MMR. (COVID one isn't available here yet.) Doing shots on a Friday night used to mean something else."
"Got my flu, covid, and Hep B shots today at Walgreens. Wasn't sure how it would work in Missouri but they just asked if I had a pre-existing condition and my insurance covered it all as usual. I think I will try to get my MMR and HPV next month when I go to get second round of the Hep B."

"Lucky you. Back in Feb of this year I got my covid booster, MMR booster, and flu shot all at the same time. Unlike previous covid shots & boosters, my arm was not sore. Now, however, my state requires a PRESCRIPTION for the 25-26 Covid booster. Thanks a lot, brainworm."

I have to wait 2 months to take my covid - discovered that I am not immune to MMR - so got that vaccine today. I was so relieved to be able to get it. Hope you don't feel too badly!
"Homeschoolers in the US: 7.5% of kids not vaccinated for measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), 52% of kids not vaccinated for flu, 87% of kids not vaccinated for covid-19 Homeschooling is very popular among the religious right wing."
"for the comparison about vaccine recos for children and COVID vaccine, see the country schedules) MMR & V being recommended separately instead of combined as MMRV, is from the Guardian. (many EU countries & UK don't have a general reco for the varicella) www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025..."
"from an article in The Guardian about it, they shifted to a reco that is similar to Europe's -- the MMR is separate from the varicella instead of all four combined as MMRV it was same for the change in their general COVID vaccine reco for children"
"I will. But having no MMR means KIDS, up & coming, won't have them. And there are ppl without insurance who can't get COVID vaccines if the government won't pay for them"
"Yet, the Trump Administration has issued new guidelines that would require prescriptions for anyone under 65 trying to get the COVID vaccine – including high risk individuals – & to not recommend the MMR vaccine for children under 4, ignoring decades of scientific evidence."
Got my COVID and flu shot as well as a MMR booster.
Don't forget this. He's going to use RFK Jr to cancel vaccine supply. Not just of COVID but MMR bsky.app/profile/arst...

damn simultaneous covid shot + tetanus shot + mmr booster got hands
"There is a sad irony for the antivaxxers in that they clearly hate COVID vaccines, but by lumping up MMR and hepatitis B in the discussions this week, they increased hostility towards ACIP (deservedly) and will ensure that many states dismiss ACIP recommendations altogether including on COVID"
"rocking covid, flu, and mmr shots this morning. Come at me bro"
Their cherry picked data shows that the MMR vaccine is killing 2M children a year! Luckily one of their group sells a patent vitamin E pill that kills covid and measles.
"Getting my MMR and COVID jabs today. (My doctor ran my MMR titers, and I need a boost.)"
"ICYMI: A CDC vaccine panel handpicked by RFK Jr is meeting to review recs for MMR, varicella (chickenpox), hepatitis B, and COVID-19. Yesterday, they voted to limit the combined MMRV vax for kids 4 and under. @cameronoakes.bsky.social is following along: rewirenewsgroup.com/2025/09/18/c..."
"i did flu/covid/mmr all at once wednesday and the pharmacy tech was like ""uhhh, you sure about this?"" don't think i've gotten that much sleep in a single night in months."
"I got MMR earlier this year, covid, flu, and tdap this week. I'm gonna ask my doc what it'll take to get me shingles and pneumonia."
"In two CVS visits I got vaxxed for Covid, flu, pneumonia, hepatitis B and MMR would have done TDAP but I'm current"
"I'll say that my understanding of the MMRV recommendation doesn't change the schedule for separate MMR and V vaccines, only the combined one, so hopefully that is less impactful. However, we'll see about the Friday votes on HepB and COVID vaccines. Ugh."
"Just stupidity. I'm a 65 year old breast cancer survivor, I've had 7 Covid shots & I got an MMR booster 3 weeks ago. I've also had an pneumonia shot, shingles shot (2 doses), an RSV shot, a 2025 flu shot (last week) and fighting for my 8th Covid shot. I believe in science. Vaccines saves lives."
"We went to CVS at lunch and got walk-up appointments to get 'Å®#COVID'Å©, 'Å®#flu'Å©, and 'Å®#MMR'Å© (for 'Å®#measles'Å©) vaccines. We'll be feelin' our arms tonight! 'Å®#AntiAntiVax'Å©"
"Fun fact: I'm ""of a certain age"" & had no record of whether or not I had received a killed virus MMR when I was little. Clued in by a WaPo commenter, I went and got an MMR shot in 2020 because there was some evidence that it would be helpful against bad outcomes from covid. These morons are morons."
"So they want to break apart the MMR/(V) components to protect against the small risk of febrile sezures, but doesn't want kids to get a Covid vaccine because the risk for complications is only for a small number of kids?"
"Just called my son and advised he take his 16 month old in for a checkup even if he needs to claim she's got symptoms of a cold or something and make damned sure she's had every shot she's eligible for TOMORROW, before the state of Louisiana has time to curtail MMR the way they have COVID boosters."
man everyone was distracted by hep b and covid but they went for MMR first
"Furthermore, the American Insurance company trade group already came out out and said ""we're covering covid shots through 2026, we dgaf what rfk says."" Given how much more it would cost insurance to treat measles, I have little doubt they'd do the same for MMR if RFK tried to pull it."
"Thanks for the link. My kiddo turns 4 in March, and he's due for MMR, DTaP, IPV, and V then. I've been super worried that any/all of them would be pulled. Of course, I still have to worry about them pulling COVID from him, but we'll worry about that tomorrow."
"went and got covid and mmr boosters today. i recommend you do the same, before our nurglite hhs secretary takes away the option entirely"
"The CDC is a failed institution & we are worse off because of it. Kids should get the MMR vaccine, it's not even a question. And I already got my COVID booster. Glad that my state is smart & writing their own guidelines, but then what exactly are we getting from the feds? apple.news/AILlCaYVTRoe..."
"Filed under ""Get 'em While You Still Can,"" I popped over to my local Duane Reade (aka Walgreen's) here in Queens, NY, and got the latest COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine, plus a booster for my MMR, because my primary doc said titers from my childhood vax were barely detectable last December."
"Welp, this Kimmel stuff sure is doing a good job of pushing the CDC's vaccine meeting out of the headlines. Just a friendly reminder that the future of the COVID and MMR vaccines is being ""discussed"" right now by RFK's lackeys. I just don't wanna lose sight of that as they layer on more bullshit."
"In preparation for a trip, I got some vaccinations: Hepatitis A, MMR, and Typhoid. I asked if I could get the flu and COVID while I was there, and the nurses said ""no, we don't recommend getting 5 in one sitting."" Aww, I was hoping to get Max Vax'd."
"The CDC's new vaccine advisory committee members were chosen for their skepticism about vaccines. Today, they're considering scaling back Hep B at birth, changing how MMR + chickenpox vaccines are given, and narrowing COVID recs. This doesn't give parents more choice — it limits it. #medsky #cdc"
"Got my Covid and flu shots today. Threw in an MMR booster, too. (Titers showed I still have measles antibodies, but none for mumps. Those aren't going around YET but why wait?). Gonna feel like garbage tomorrow, but hey, anytime you can give RFK Jr a middle finger you should do it."
"Got 3 boosters today: covid, flu, and MMR. Yay for vaccines!"
Got my flu shot while I was at the tail end of covid recovery. I'm old enough that I predate the MMR vaccine. Guess what I had as a kid? All three. Get your shots folks.

"On Friday, I got my flu shot, the pneumonia vaccine, and the hepatitis-b vaccine. Tonight I got the Covid vaccine. Tomorrow I'm getting tested to make sure I still have antibodies for MMR, and if I don't I'll get a booster. I am 54 and I am NOT FUCKING AROUND."
People have gotten too lazy to read. Just have children space apart the MMR and chicken pox vaccines; same with initial doses of covid vaccine. It's like people who are surprised they feel bloated after a plate of corn dogs. Well... consuming a bunch of battered meat will do that Cleefus
"Dr. Jack, It was floating around the Internet, individuals born between 1963 and 1967 may not be protected for MMR. Blood work showed I had no immunity for the diseases. My doctor ordered vaccines for me and over a few days I now have protection for: COVID Flu Pnuemonia MMR Science is good stuff!"
"I have an appointment to get covid, flu, and MMR vaccines this Friday. If you're in USA, please get whatever vaccines you're due for, covid, and flu before our government makes it hard/impossible. #VaccinesWork #Vaccines"
"(It's already starting, even the supposedly age-&-health-condition ""qualifying"" members of my family will have to go across said state line to be graciously permitted covid vaccines & thank God none of us have infants needing their first MMR shots)"
"Next year there likely won't be any Covid rec for children at all and flu will also possibly get yanked. A really concerning number is that 9 percent skipped Polio or MMR vaccines. While Polio takes awhile for cases to start increasing again, Measles certainly doesn't."

"From new @kff.org / @washingtonpost.com survey: Nine in Ten Parents Say It Is Important for Children To Be Vaccinated Against MMR and Polio, Fewer Say the Same About the Flu and COVID-19"
Same. MMR was earlier this year. Shingles will be in November as I was told to wait 8weeks after covid. Tho I'm going to research that. May also be cuz I'm immunocompromised
"""9% have skipped the polio or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) shots"", that's clear. But what does ""excluding for coronavirus or flu"" mean here?"
"The trouble is he is a bone marrow transplant patient, and the last covid jab he got tanked his white blood cells. The rest of us get it, but it sort of is fucked for his already fucked immune system. He can't get the mmr yet either."
Got my MMR left arm. Nothing Got my Shingles right arm. sore for about 10days. Its a 2 shot vaccine so next one in 2 to 4 month later. Next up covid and tdap. Feeling the pressure to rush through the list of vaccines before the government eliminates them all.
"I'm living proof that vaccines work! I am up to date on all of them. Unfortunately the MMR vaccine was not available when I was a kid. Now I have the Pneumonia , RSV, Shingles, & Flu shots... Just waiting for my COVID booster."
"Lucky got my Covid-19, Flu, Adapted and MMR vaccines today. It required judging the forms a tiny bit...but I was due all of them."
"Seconded. I got my flu and an MMR booster (outbreak in Texas, again fuck RFK Jr) on Friday and will be getting COVID next month."
"I just got blocked by someone for pointing out that the Covid vaccine rarely causes mild myocarditis. The MMR vaccine causes encephalitis in 1 in 10,000 children. It's in your pediatrician information. The warnings are there so that you can respond appropriately, not to prevent vaccines."
"I rushed to get my COVID vaccine cuz I have no clue if they'd change the ""at risk"" list. Got all my titers checked too (was just checking MMR but PCP wanted to check everything). Found my chickenpox vaccine was no longer effective. Never had chickenpox, so I had to redo the varicella vaccine"
"I plan to get my 10th COVID shot this week and my flu shot next week. I don't need two sore arms. My PCP informed me on 9/12 that I could skip the RSV shot. I'm current on Shingrix, pneumonia, MMR, and TDaP."
"why does tdap hurt SO MUCH tho? i also got covid, flu, and MMR this year and it took me out"
"I got COVID, flu, pneumonia, and MMR (since I'm over 55 and the MMR shots I got as a kid are now known to need a booster in older adults) last week. Just sore arms for 1 or 2 days, nbd."
"Got COVID, flu and MMR vaccines on Friday at a Safeway in Seattle, no hassles. I'm not 100% sure I needed the MMR, as my mom generally kept us up to date when we were kids, but I don't have the records from 40+ years ago, so I figured I might as well 🤷🏻♀️"
"Dang. That's literally worse than Alberta. When I got my MMR shots last month they saw that my tetanus shot was out of date and gave me a TDAP booster as well. I've also started on getting my Polio vaccine. If course, I'm still going to have to pony up for my COVID shot (thanks Danielle!)"
There are further examples here. Whether it happens more often in people who have achieved fame (increasing confidence in their judgment & inuring them to criticism) is unclear. But even journalists suffer from this too - see for eg woeful coverage of MMR & Covid. en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_d...
Glad I got a Tdap booster as well as an MMR. I got the 2025 flu shot and hoping for a new Covid. I'm in FL so it will be a miracle if I can get it.
"I did a ""well better safe than sorry"" and today was Flu/Covid/MMR so ... we'll see if my body doesn't like this new combo. Nothing to bad so far."
That's not what we're discussing here. We're discussing whether that's sufficient to curb the spread / deaths; to which you're aping the discussion around MMR vaccines. Do you even know how Covid works? Have you inquired with your doctor whether you should be doing anything else ON TOP of the vax?
"Skipped MMR for now - my body is already exhausted and dropping tdap and covid on it is enough - I only have tomorrow to recuperate, not an entire weekend."
"I got COVID, MMR, and pneumonia vax. Went home, slept about 10 hours. Sore arm yesterday. More or less back to ""normal"" today."

"My 22 yo had titers drawn and turns out he's not immune to measles and chickenpox (despite having had all childhood vaccines). He and I received our Covid vaccines a couple of weeks ago, so he had to wait to get his MMR and varicella vaccines again, but we scrambled to get him in this week."
"I went to the Kroger pharmacy where I got other vaccines (MMR, flu, Shingrix 1, and RSV) but Indiana hasn't given them permission to administer the COVID vaccine yet. However, a few feet away from the pharmacy counter, you can get one at The Little Clinic. Go figure."
☹️ But cute bandages! I got my MMR vaccines on Thursday. I'll get the flu and covid shots next month...I think that's when they're out for us.
"Früher ging man zum Zeitungsstandler und verlangte lautstark den Playboy, das SOZ, das österreichische Kontaktmagazin und ganz kleinlaut die Krone. Heute lautstark MMR, FSME und HPV und under the counter gibt's dann noch die *psst* COVID Impfung."
"I got those after my COVID shot, as well. But, not once did I receive anything of the sort for well established vaccinations for my children. My son had an adverse speech reaction (lost and regressed speech for 2 months - returned w/ stutter) to the MMRV and then the MMR (regressed) many years ago."
Got my MMR booster and flu shot yesterday so today will be mostly lounging about. I had scheduled a covid booster too but they won't let anyone under 65 get one without a prescription so that's just great.
Guess who got their MMR today? Meeeee I had a blood test to see if I had Immunity to Measles- Nada I love Science! Covid and the Flu Vax are up next.
"I thought about it too! I was just a little worried about three vaxes, since the COVID vax usually takes me out for 24-48 hours. Didn't want to be down for even longer lol. Might do the MMR later this fall though."
"Thanks! COVID, flu, and MMR for funsies!"
"Got an appointment this afternoon for flu and COVID vaccines, hoping to re-up my MMR as well. Just in case. I don't want to catch or spread any of that"
Prior officials did not miss or hide deaths from COVID vaccines. They investigate these reports very seriously. If you've heard of people reporting they turned into the Hulk years after the MMR or that childhood vaccines turned a little girl into Wonder Woman it's bc those reports were investigated!
"Getting lots a shots today, Covid, flu and a MMR booster. Not playing with y'all out here."
"Welp. If you haven't gotten you COVID booster, flu shot, MMR & other shots yet, I'd strongly advise doing so within the next week."
"not sure about where you live, but my local publix pharmacy gives covid, flu, pneumonia, dtap, shingles, etc... no prescription needed. don't know about MMR as I had it as a child and my recent titer showed immunity."
I think he is including the flu and covid ones and counting MMR and DTap etc as 3 vaccines
"I printed out my vaccination records. I've received 8 COVID vaccinations (including boosters). I've gotten the shingles vaccine; MMR (I had measles and mumps prior to the vaccination's avail, flu shots, RSV, and pneumonia. Yes, I feel crappy after each one, but all of it is preferable to the disease"
"Get your mmr vax checked too, there's a thing called a titer test to check whether or not covid fucked with your vaccination working properly"

Since chicken pox and measles are in neighboring counties in getting the following vaccines today 1 flu 2. Covid 3. tdap 4. Shingles 5. MMR My insurance will cover all except the shingles but since I've got my out of of pocket max they have to pay for it too
"I got a Covid boster a couple of months ago at a CVS in Bear, Delaware. A couple of weeks ago I got a flu shot, an MMR booster, and a polio booster, no questions asked."
I got the mmr vaccine last week because the vaccine I may have had in the 70's was the best and I couldn't find any evidence that I'd even had it. There were 0 side effects!! Like not even a sore arm. It was so much better than the covid/flu ones.
"#grandparentsForVaccines. I am 72 and remember my parents worrying about us getting polio. Then, a miracle! The polio vaccine. My older sis got measles and mumps at Kindergarten and brought home to me. Then, a miracle!The MMR vaccine! People were dying from COVID.Then a miracle! Don't go backwards."
"I did Fly/COVID/MMR in one arm last year and felt fine, dunno what is different this time"
"I found NIH doc: coadmin is ok, found a Canadian document, but can't find a CDC doc with a wait suggested. Even the MMR specific doc doesn't mention COVID interactions. The doc I linked seems to say ""go for it"". I even looked at old revs, there was a 2 week period just for Covid in '21-22 but nixed."
Yay! I got my Covid and MMR on Monday
"Just got turned down for Moderna vax because had MMR yesterday. Can't find a CDC citation that says they can be co-administered, guidelines treating mRNA Covid vax like live vax. Any authoritative sources you can point me to so I can gently encourage my pharmacist I don't need to wait 4 weeks?"
"Covid, flu, and MMR booster done! Fuck off brain worm JFKJr"
So you can skip tetanus shots Polio Chickenpox Meningitis MMR Flu COVID And spread it across US but dogs need their shots. Insanity
I did the thing. You should also do the thing. This is an extremely important year to get as many vaccines in your body as possible. Today was flu and covid. Next round will be TDAP and an MMR reup just for safes.
"Getting covid, mmr booster and shingles vaccines today. Because I still can !!!"
"Surprisingly little discomfort in the wake of yesterday's new covid vax and MMR booster. Didn't sleep great, but didn't experience the usual achy, vaguely sick-like feeling this time."
"Getting flu, covid, and pneumonia shots Saturday. Need a recovery day before work on Monday. Had my titers checked and no need for MMR. Not eligible for RSV yet. 30 years ago I wouldn't have been so eager to get shots. 😂🤷♀️"
"I'm getting covid, flu, rsv, and a repeat mmr next week at the same time. I'm sure I'll feel super punk too but only after 24-48 hours when I pick myself up off the floor 😂 #worthit"
"I had the flu in 1994. I still remember it. After that I got vaccinated yearly. Haven't had it since. No Covid either, get all my shots, 🤔 they really might work. I did get the mumps as a kid before there was MMR, was not fun"
"Yep got my vaccines today ! It was a vaccine hat trick for yours truly, Covid , flu and MMR !"
"Getting the updated covid vax was a no-brainer. And at 56 years old, I figured my measles protection was either reduced or on its way to becoming reduced, making getting the MMR in the age of RFK's measles promotion also a no-brainer."
I wish RFK jr would get drug resistant TB ...and polio and MMR and Hepatitis B and COVID and bird flu and TDP and RSV and chickenpox and shingles
What an effing mess. So glad I got my MMR booster this year. That I as of yet can't get my COVID annual is ridiculous.
"Anyway, I received Covid, MMR, and flu vaccines today. I didn't necessarily need the MMR because I was born after 1967 and got vaccinated as a little one, but I decided to be on the safe side. You know, in case they disappear."
"$173 for covid vax, $120 for MMR"
Getting COVID and MMR boosters in a moment.
I'm 61 and had the MMR booster last year. I was far less draggy and sore than today after receiving the updated COVID booster last night. Highly recommended. bsky.app/profile/dway...
"Mandates have not ended yet in Florida. It will require action by the state legislature and according to @politico.com Florida playbook, many lawmakers are hesitant. #vaccines #measles #MedSky #IDSky #COVID #MMR"
"This year I've gotten the MMR, flu, DTaP, and pneumonia shots. I'm going to get the new COVID shot this coming weekend. Not trusting TX or RFK Jr. about availability of vaccines in the coming year."
I got a MMR/TDAP/HEP B all at the same time last year. Only the covid shots ever make me feel bad. Totally worth it.
"For me personally public health intervention work. Options: Mask bloc/covid resource distribution and doing the legwork to source stuff in the new landscape; getting people coordinated and transported for MMR, Hep B, and other vaccines; trans care/HRT advocacy, targeted hospital campaigns etc."
"Six covid cases on LTCs, 1,895 Measle cases in Alberta. UCP, Abpremier failures continue to endanger lives."
Put covid aside because they were working against an unknown killer. You are causing illness and death that is preventable by saying things against the measle vaccine for example.
hahahhaa! My wife has wolverine blood. Wolverine from the comics. She has never had covid nor the flu in the 1400yrs we've been married. She disgusts me. But now she'll get measles and give it to me and I'll die.
