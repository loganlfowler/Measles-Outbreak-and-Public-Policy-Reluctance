skeptic,Unreal_777,1760351395.0,People trust experts too much,"People like to pretend you need to trust experts in various domains, but we know that:

1. They can make mistakes
2. They can be biased (naturally or financially)

Examples:

1. Michael Ignatieff (academic / public intellectual / politician) Ignatieff publicly retracted or expressed regret over his prior support for the Iraq War. In a 2007 New York Times Magazine article, he admitted that he and other commentators had been wrong in supporting the invasion.
2. 2009–10 H1N1 “Pandemrix” (Europe) — Finnish vaccine chief apologized

What changed: After mass use of GSK’s Pandemrix during the swine-flu pandemic, Finland and Sweden detected a sharp rise in narcolepsy in children and teens who’d received the vaccine. Multiple epidemiologic studies later quantified the association.

The apology: Terhi Kilpi, head of vaccines at Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), said in a 2011 interview she was “very sorry” and apologized to the families affected by vaccine-associated narcolepsy. (Finnish: “pyytää… anteeksi niiltä perheiltä…”)

Follow-ups: Sweden’s health minister said he was willing to issue a public apology to those affected, and Ireland’s HSE apologized for distress caused to families as supports were clarified. Courts have since ordered compensation in some countries.

3) IPCC / climate panel on Himalayan glaciers In the 2007 IPCC report, a claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 was later found to be erroneous (a typographical or citation error). The IPCC issued a statement of regret and more careful wording going forward.

4) Dengvaxia (Philippines) — Sanofi executive apologized

What changed: Post-licensure data showed the dengue vaccine increased risk of severe dengue in people without prior infection, prompting restrictions to seropositive individuals and suspension of the Philippine school program.

The apology: During a December 13, 2017 Philippine congressional hearing, Thomas Triomphe (then Sanofi Pasteur Asia-Pacific head) apologized for the confusion caused by the company’s communication and said there was “no need to panic.”

5) RotaShield (USA, 1999) — recommendation reversed and vaccine withdrawn

What changed: After rollout, CDC detected a signal for intussusception (a bowel obstruction) following RotaShield in infants; ACIP withdrew its recommendation and the manufacturer pulled the vaccine. (Subsequent rotavirus vaccines were redesigned and extensively studied.)

6) Gérard Théry (engineer / telecom expert in France) Telecom / network / communications He predicted the Internet was “ill-suited to the provision of commercial services”, a statement later proved wrong.

The most important comment in the context of r/skeptic:

* _I’ve been asked how to interpret the AAP not following the recommendations of the ACIP [the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]. I say you are asking the wrong question. The question is, how did the ACIP get to the point where it is scientifically inconsistent with all the rest of the scientific world? **The question should be, ‘What happened to the ACIP?’ Not ‘what happened to the AAP?’**_


This question has to be asked in the context of all other governmental scientific and science-adjacent agencies in the USA.

Osterholm further comments:


* _The bottom line is that we cannot trust the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CDC right now. It’s a terribly hard thing for me to say. The CDC is such a very important voice. There are still very talented and highly trained professionals at the CDC, but what is happening to the leadership—specifically, Secretary Kennedy and his colleagues—has brought it to the point where it can’t be trusted._

Note to mention:

* _I have never seen [so many] dangerous and potentially catastrophic decisions being made by HHS as I have in the last 10 weeks. We need mRNA technology for our influenza vaccines to have any hope of having enough vaccines available for the first year to year and half of the next possible flu pandemic. Now, we can make enough vaccine for a quarter of the world’s population during the first 15-18 months of a pandemic, with the chicken-egg culture we use today. That is an example of a very dangerous situation that we could basically take off the table if we have research and development invested in mRNA technology._

 _My point is that we can’t stop a pandemic. Once a virus takes off, nothing really can be done. When a spillover happens from animals to humans in any part of the world, when people travel, that virus can quickly spread. That’s why we have to prepare for that and minimize the impact of that spread with vaccines that we develop as quickly as possible to that specific virus. We need to make lots of it and to get it out, and mRNA is an important part of being able to do that._

And:

*  _No. I would have to say that we are in worse shape. We don’t have the opportunity now to use tools like mRNA in a meaningful way. If a pandemic begins to emerge, we will divide up into camps to go at each other. We would right now have major challenges bringing people together, and if there were ever a time when we needed to bring people together against a common enemy—i.e. a virus—it’s during a pandemic._ 

 _We need to do that. But we have nothing at this point to support that. We should deal with all of this now, game the situation, and work out what we would do._

.

The points Osterholm makes are COVID/pandemic-specific, but they reflect the state of _government-funded **and** government-**approved** science-in-general in the USA._",1ntu0p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1ntu0p1/michael_osterholm_of_cidrap_were_even_less/,233
skeptic,Genericisopod,1758989203.0,Finding reliable and well-researched diet/nutrition advice is difficult and frustrating.,"I have some autoimmune issues and have gained a LOT of weight in the last few years. I suspect aging, various hormone changes, and having a long period of extreme stress may be issues contributing to this. I noticed that after having COVID a few years ago, hiking and other activities became more difficult and, until recently, I had issues taking in complete breaths. (This was especially noticeable during swimming.)

I have found that doctors don’t take these concerns seriously. I’m not entirely blaming them because many have limited time they can spend with patients.

However, attempts to find information on my own quickly take me into the arena of dubious claims. Leaky gut. Vagal nerves this and that. Toxins! And, oh horrors, chemicals! 

I’m not closed minded. I trained as a massage therapist (although, again, I never got a good explanation of what “toxins” are). But, I want to know why I feel so rotten and I want to look further into certain conditions without someone trying to sell me a supplement. 

Any go to sources? Is there an anti-Dr. Oz out there?

skeptic,GreatestEspanita,1758931603.0,Is MMS/CDS really pseudomedicine?,"
In the latest months of my life I have come across several persons that have become rather close to me, and, incidentally, a surprising number of them would seem to swear on this stuff. 

1. One reason to be suspicious, they claim, of the warnings from big institutions, like the spanish goverment or the FDA, that heavily discourage the use of this stuff, is the claimed absence of actual studies, even of those that could, possibly, disprove the effectiveness of it. Is this true? If so, why is it? Could it really be a reason to start being skeptical about the warnings? On the contrary, I would really appreciate if you could indicate me the relevant studies or how to find them!

2. Following from that, I have skimmed through a couple publications I could find, most of them focusing on its possible application against Covid, and to my surprise, they would seem to indicate that Chlorine Dioxide IS effective against the virus? But even then, there are concerns for its toxicity, but couldnt one procure to ingest low enough doses and continue its use? Isnt toxicity a concern for any other kind of medication? If so, why the apparent big stink in the media and from goverment institutions? 

3. But even IF this stuff is good for treating colds and Covid, why has it been linked with so much evident quackery? like as a purported miracle cure of clearly unrelated diseases, including cancer and autism. Is the fact that this has been sold and popularized in such absurd premises really enough of a proof to discard its use wholesale? 

The people I know, at least from now, really only have procured their use for colds and such other stuff, which wouldnt seem to be as nonsensical as the other things the books and websites they got the idea from would seem to say. So, my concern currently, is on the question of whether its use for this stuff, in low, homemade, doses is really that harmful, and if it is, I would like to count with the tools to prove it so, I know them to be open minded, and I am honestly lacking some information myself, but so are they! So this isnt a hopeless endeavor, in both ways.

skeptic,antoniodiavolo,1758775174.0,Anyone else have a family member who basically just uncritically believes everything Joe Rogan says?,"I’ve never really cared for Joe Rogan even when he isn’t being political. He just kinda comes across as a meathead and I don’t really care for podcasts on just “whatever”.  I listen to the episodes where he interviews magicians but that’s about it.

My dad was a lifelong Democrat until around 2020 which is also when he started listening to a lot of Joe Rogan. His opinions on basically everything have changed since then and from what I can tell, it pretty much exactly mirrors Joe Rogan. From vaccines, to politics, to even psychedelics. 

After Joe had Terrence Howard on his show, I listened to the episode because I think Terry is insane. I couldn’t finish it because Joe basically didn’t push back on anything Terrence says and also seemed to think Terry was a genius. It seemed to be this combination of Joe understanding just enough of what Terry was saying (“there are no straight lines in nature”, that sort of thing) but not the other stuff like when he talks about “wave conjugations” and “the Dewey decimal system” that he just assumes Terry must be intelligent.

I asked my dad about it and, unsurprisingly, his take was that Terry is “extremely intelligent”. 

We also went to a museum with our neighbors and there was an exhibit on the moon landing and he kept talking about how fake it was. And around that time I saw a clip going around on Twitter about Joe Rogan talking about the moon landing being fake.

One time I said I don’t like that Joe Rogan basically never pushes back on his guests at all and my dad went on this long rant about how that’s a good thing and it’s what separates him from the mainstream media is that he doesn’t antagonize them at all and just lets them talk.

But I think there is a way to gently push people on their beliefs and get them to elaborate without just being like “woah dude maybe you’re right and 1x1 does equal 2”.

Idk does anyone else have a family member like this? How do you even handle this?

The only time I tried to press him on a single conspiracy theory, asking him why they would put all of that effort in. Like who would it benefit? And it seemed like his entire thoughts on it terminated in “they’re doing it to deceive people”, with no further elaboration as to what they would stand to gain by doing so.

Hank discusses his theory on this phenomenon, using the controversy around Ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment as an example. He then details a model that he believes explains the spread of such misinformation.

In an interview with Joe Rogan, Mel Gibson promotes four substances he considers ""miracle cures"" for cancer:

- Ivermectin: An anti-parasitic drug.
- Fenbendazole: Another anti-parasitic drug.
- Methylene Blue: An industrial product, like a fabric dye.
- Hydroxychloroquine: A drug that requires a prescription.

Hank notes that while these substances have nothing in common chemically, they share four key characteristics:

1. They are cheap: The drugs are inexpensive, costing between $20 to $50.

2. They are widely available: They can be easily obtained, either over-the-counter or through specific doctors.

3. They have minimal side effects: At typical doses, they do not cause noticeable or severe side effects for most people.

4. They are a little bit dangerous: They are dangerous enough in certain situations, at high doses, or for specific individuals to prompt public health warnings. The speaker explains that these warnings are then perceived as an overreaction by people who have taken the substances without harm, which fuels the belief that ""the establishment"" is trying to hide something.",1nlwiyw,https://youtu.be/QC9glJa1-c0?si=nHhDG-O1HbvLRizm,172

Basically, this company sells headphones that distance little speakers from your head connected to little tubes that go into your ears. Looks terrible and probably sounds worse, but the underlying claim is that, for $80, they will keep your head free from RF & EMF (one graphic at the link calls it ELF, which is even better). 

I know people have been blaming EMF exposure for cancer for as long as I have been alive (I'm in my 50s), particularly people who lived near high power transmission lines.  I remember hearing claims of cancer and mobile phones since they first came on the wider market, but as far as I know, no study has ever backed up these claims.  
  
I hadn't heard about worries regarding headphones, however, which is remarkable considering how common they have become in everyday use.

skeptic,workerbotsuperhero,1758109293.0,Tell me about some books and other places to read up on cults,"An older family member of mine has become unrecognizable after getting taken in by right wing media and a church group. We used to be close, and I actually believed for many years that we were held the same values. But all that has gone out the window. 

Nowadays, almost every conversation includes parroting right wing figures' talking points. It's really killing our relationship. Sometimes the regurgitated rhetoric includes things I really care about professionally and intellectually. I work in healthcare, and it's stressful to hear someone I used to really trust and enjoy talking with quoting garbage political talking points about medical research, public health, vaccines, and climate change. We can disagree about tax rates - but that stuff is objectively false and harmful. This person can't stop bringing this crap up. So it's hard to look past. 

I have read many similar accounts over the past decade, so I'm pretty sure I'm not alone here. It's been validating to hear other people's experiences with similar relationships. 

For a few years, I've heard people argue that the powerful right wing American political machine is behaving like a cult. And honestly , that explanation is making a lot of sense to me. 

This family member did really crave belonging and had some social insecurities. So I understand how that makes people vulnerable. And I get that this flavor of aggressive political propaganda creates a feedback loop of dopamine, scapegoating, and righteous anger. It's been weird watching this family member adopt these traits and attitudes, because anger and authoritarian attitudes were not big personality traits in the past. 

Unfortunately, the empathy, listening skills, and thoughtfulness - which used to make this older relative fairly beloved to many people I know - all seem to have evaporated. Or at least put on the back burner. The ?cult celebrates anger, grievances, righteousness, macho posturing as strength, authoritian family relationships, religious hardline beliefs. These attitudes have been getting harder and harder to listen to. 

What else is going on here, with so many similar people? Are we just watching, in granular detail in our personal lives, a massive political cult dominating the world's most powerful country and government? 

How can I understand this idea better? 

This Reddit For Grownups post has a good discussion:

For example, covid virus and flu virus are distantly related and have the same symptoms, polio virus and coxsackievirus A21 are the same species and have very different symptoms. That said, all viruses of the subgenus Sarbecovirus which is named after the founding virus, the SARS COV virus, should be called SARS COV type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. according to their order of discovery. The second type discovered was not called SARS COV 2, the third type discovered was not called SARS COV 3 and so on and so forth. It's messed up. 30 types were discovered by 2008. SARS COV 2 is not the second type of Sarbecovirus discovered. It should not be called SARS COV 2.

In fact, it’s already available for free in both the US and UK on Kindle (I note Jeff Bezos is one of the ‘stars’ Becker’s security firm has protected). 

Thanks to the Kindle book being free, it’s now the #1 bestseller in categories such as ‘Virology’, ‘Basic Medical Science’, and ‘Health and Fitness’. 

I’ve just downloaded it myself, so have yet to go through it properly. 

I wanted to post this here to see if anyone has already read it, as well as a heads-up to everyone as this is likely to be something people reference, given its provocative perspectives and subject matter.

Anyways I’ve been talking to this guy who I really like, and during the first month it was going pretty well and it still is but something kinda happened and it’s made the past week a bit overwhelming for me. We’re both into spirituality and connecting with spirit & all that stuff, and that’s what we bond with a lot.

Over a few days ago I mentioned to him over text that I’ll be getting my covid vaccine soon and that I’m feeling a bit nervous about it, then he calls me right after reading my message, I don’t answer because I was in the middle of something so I decide to just call him back later. He proceeds to text me after calling and goes “Please do not get that shot” & then starts sending me links to videos of scientists running tests and other experiments or whatever, claiming that they’ve been discovering “graphene” in covid vaccines and other spooky things inside of peoples blood that have had the vaccine, showing that it’s destroyed white blood cells and is just the worst thing you can do for your body.

Now I’ve come across all this information before so It’s nothing new to me and I did used to believe it for a while but after some time I just stopped because I didn’t wanna keep scaring myself and I just decided that it was all just fear mongering bullshit.

But he continues to share how he feels about it and tells me that it’s “Its actually designed to allow remote control of your vibration your meditations would become pointless” and just begging me to stay away from it because he cares about my well-being. Telling me that i can kiss my whole spiritual journey and evolution goodbye since it lowers your vibrations yada yada. & he also says that if I get it he won’t want to be anywhere near me, that it messes with your life and affects other people around you as well

He says he’s speaking from experience because he’s had some vaccine like a decade ago that his doctor strongly advised him to get and he said ever since he’s not felt like himself, he’s currently dealing with some neck issue with a pinched nerve causing him muscle spasms and other sensations that he says may be happening because he got that vaccine

He also is confidently saying that covid isn’t real, explaining that it’s just the regular flu but it’s being manipulated or mutated from a reaction our that bodies are having to the air around us that’s being affected by the frequencies being emitted from 5g towers lol. Ik how crazy that sounds and I wasn’t trying to argue with him or judge him because I still like him and I was just caught so off guard.

He just keeps begging me to stay pure and that he doesn’t want me to fall victim to the tricks and lies of the system and is hoping I can reconsider this. Disappointingly I canceled my vaccination appointment (ik i might get shit for this) but the fear mongering did its job and im no anti vaxxer, at least I don’t wanna be but he’s literally making me feel like I don’t know what to believe or what’s real anymore at the moment

This is the most strange situation ive ever experienced with another human being. Idk what to do because I was doing my own research and came across this German Chemist named Andreas Noack and shared his findings of graphene in the vaccines and then apparently two hours after he uploaded that video he was assassinated. 

Idk I wanna get the vaccine because Long Covid is scary, but I also don’t wanna risk anything from what he’s saying, he cried to me saying that it’s the truth and that the vaccine does everything he saying it does and that he knows this for a fact. It’s scaring me and if you can’t already tell it’s getting in my head.

skeptic,,1757374348.0,Question for this community. Where should we get our pertinent healthcare information on vaccines now?,"Now that the Trump regime is cutting vital services and replacing experts with outright cranks, there's been censorship and anti-science infiltration of U.S. government websites — [and affecting other countries as well](https://www.sciencearena.org/en/news/bmj-the-lancet-editorials-censorship-donald-trump/).

The censorship and disinformation is so dire that an Ex-NOAA science writer has started climate.us to replace climate.gov now that the fascist regime is dismantling science on the government website.

Here's her interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkzKR4JtnyQ

I plan to use [climate.us](https://www.climate.us/) for climate information since the .gov has been poisoned by the anti-science fascist regime.

Now I'm trying to figure out where can I get up-to-date information on vaccines that hasn't had data poisoned by our current regime?

What prompted me to post this is just a few minutes ago I had an elderly loved one discount the effectiveness of the flu vaccine based upon misinformation she was fed.

In the past I've found it's effective to look up the misinformation directly then usually find out it's based on half-truths — and once I explain the larger picture I can convince them to get the shots.

This time when I tried to pull up information I noticed that the search engines are increasingly trying to pull up info that leans towards whatever the fascist regime wants us to see.

I went to the CDC website and it dawned on me that they are very likely being censored and/or edited just like we're starting to see with climate.gov.

Where would you, dear skeptics, go right now to find out current info on flu vaccines?  For example, how effective is the flu shot for people 65 and older?

Do we need to increasingly get this info from some European websites?  Can I even use the CDC gov website at this point or has it been censored and/or distorted like climate.gov has?

I think we need to figure this out and I desperately want to hear good faith opinions on where we are today with this — and where it seems to be going in regard to acquiring accurate healthcare information *despite* the fascist regime.

Meanwhile, researchers in Southeast Asia have found several bat coronaviruses that are genetically closer to SARS-CoV-2, particularly in Laos where [BANAL-52 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04532-4)and related strains share over 96% similarity, slightly more than RaTG13. Cambodia and Thailand have also reported related viruses, showing that the region is a hotspot for sarbecoviruses. The World Health Organization continues to request early data and records from China, but Chinese authorities insist they have been transparent while officially declaring in 2025 that their investigation is completed but the full results are kept secret, apparently the investigation found out that the virus really didn't originate in China but was imported through [frozen goods from USA](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/covid-19-plot-twist-china-claims-virus-may-have-emerged-from-the-us-125050100724_1.html), and maybe originated there from a lab leak (ironic). In practice, most new scientific progress on natural origins now comes from outside China, while China itself has remained publicly silent on the issue for years, but **most likely Chinese scientists have sampled thousands of wild bats viruses, and I think there is a high change that they found some very close relatives to covid-19 (like Cambodia, Thailand and Laos did)**, pint pointing the region where it came from.

Edit: people in the comments are talking about the natural origin as if I questioned it. But I did not anywhere in the post. The post never questioned the natural origin. I think that a lot of people here don't understand my argument or the issue in general. Covid-19 didn't originate in a wet market but in a bat cave on the other side of China where bats were captured (or an intermediate host) and then taken to that wet market in Wuhan, Wuhan doesn't have rain forests with the type of bats that are carriers for this types of viruses. Laos, Cambodia and Thailand started a research on this wild viruses and found many similar strains. China apparently didn't do any research according to them, that's really truly impossible, it would be catastrophically stupid. They clearly did some research in the dark and most likely found hundreds of strains in the wild like they already did in the past. Their claim isn't that they found nothing, their claim is that they didn't even try since the establish that covid-19 came from the USA.

And it's not even close to genuine belief as we see reports that GOP members often openly or secretly get themselves + their families vaxed (and save getting the measles the old fashioned more dangerous way for the ""suckers"" that vote for them). 

Is the profit motive here that grifters think it's ""too pricey"" to do science and have scientific experts bless what you do, so they want to get people comfortable with just believing random trash ""internet docs"" and influencer grifters say? RFK Jr. supposedly made some money off I think vaccine injury lawsuits. So maybe widening the window of what counts as ""injury "" is the profit motive? Or making Alex Jones supplement world grifter bucks? Also, the various superpowers have tossed anti-vax propaganda at each others populations at times to hurt each other's population or sow anger + skepticism towards institutions in rival countries. With a large portion of the GOP friendly with Russia now (and it's bribes in our very bribable system), and news reports of Russian propaganda behind certain anti-vax propaganda in the U.S., maybe getting U.S. leaders to convince the U.S. to weaken itself by not getting vaxed is the profit motive?

Mehdi Hasan,"This was quite an interesting interview with Mehdi Hasan about his Jubilee 'debate' that involved a very interesting discussion about when you should and when you shouldn't engage with the far right in debate (covering ideas like winning over third party viewers, the importance of the venue (i.e. Jubilee isn’t a serious debate platform, it’s trashy reality TV) and a whole lot of interesting topics. 

I would argue the relation to scepticism is that the same arguments apply to the application of scepticism. When is the right platform to debate fringe antivaxers? Do we achieve a better outcome by ostracising and very publicly rejecting any credibility of the latest magnetic Wunderwaffe instead of potentially giving them a platform by debunking them (arguably the people who are going to fall for the magnetic healing device aren't going to be convinced by an electrical engineer telling them the parts don’t do anything and explaining the physics, so are we really helping anything by giving them attention?) 

At a more meta level, I’m not going to overstate the importance of the subreddit, but I think there is an argument to be made that there is perceptual advantage to a well received post here, compared to a well received post on a UFO subreddit (that might be bigger), hence the steady stream of UFO posts trying to convince this subreddit. Admittedly, this is a little bit of a mixed up point, as it’s also tied into the larger societal ‘perception’ that, to vastly oversimplify, gives more ‘credibility’ to ‘skeptics’ compared to ‘believers’. Does that mean that we should try and hold posts to the sub to a higher standard?

It’s a tricky topic, and I will admit to leaning more towards the hold it all to a higher standard, that it’s not wrong to exclude and ostracise harmful individuals (which is admittedly a political/values based decision, I’m not convinced that Freedom of speech always and automatically trumps Freedom of association). In most of the communities I’m in a position of authority, we do adopt a stricter code of conduct, but none of them are specifically debate platforms which should have a different expectation. 

With that said, and I know I’ve fallen into it a little bit in this post, but people do sometimes get their mind changed about things, even online. Perhaps the best example we see on here is sometimes people post not knowing how strong and effective cold reading is and when it’s explained to them, [they understand ](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1meo6hj/face_reading/)(they deleted the post because they were getting teased/downvoted a bit for the pretty bad spelling/gramma, but that’s broadly what happened), so you don’t want to completely close the gate, but I do think there is an argument to be more assertive with the clearly bad faith trolls, if we are using this subreddit as an example. ",1monn7a,https://postthroughit.substack.com/p/029-should-we-debate-the-far-right,75

skeptic,Southern_log567,1754901779.0,Mind Control Tech - references in comments,"
The advancements in neurotechnology and directed energy have led to significant breakthroughs in manipulating the human mind and monitoring individuals remotely. In the 1950s, Dr. Robert Galbraith Heath used brain stimulation to trigger memories, emotions, and hallucinations. In 1973, Allan Frey discovered the Microwave Auditory Effect, which allows sound to be perceived directly in the head via microwave pulses. Joseph Sharp and Mark Groves expanded this in 1975, demonstrating that modulated microwaves could transmit speech wirelessly to the brain. In the early 2000s, John Norseen introduced ""Biofusion,"" using sensors and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to decode and interpret brain activity. Meanwhile, a 2006 FOIA disclosure revealed the existence of non-lethal weapons (NLWs) that use directed energy to induce physical and psychological effects remotely. In 2014, a Pentagon-developed laser system capable of identifying people based on their unique heartbeat showed the growing potential for biometric surveillance.

These technologies suggest a future where thoughts can be influenced, individuals can be tracked remotely, and personal privacy could be significantly compromised. These examples are the ones that are easy to find and typically used by most victims in an attempt to ""bridge the gap."" Although very intriguing, these are not what is used but just act as very easy references that the ""idea"" of manipulating the mind has been around for a very long time and has not ceased since over 70 years ago.

The trajectory is one of importance; a clear statement of what is to come is necessary to make the connection between intentions and scientific breakthroughs. In the 1994 edition of ""New World Vistas: Air and Space Power for the 21st Century,"" a major undertaking by the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, the document states clearly that looking 50 years into the future ""is easy,"" and quotes: ""We will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works, how it controls the various functions of the body, and how it can be manipulated in a fashion (both positively and negatively). One can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources, the output that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements, control emotions (and thus actions), produce sleep, transmit suggestions, interfere with both short-term and long-term memory, produce an experience set, and delete an experience set,"" and ""It would also appear possible to create high-fidelity speech in the human body, raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction."" These are clear statements of intentions to develop the capabilities of the weapons used today.

As the reader, this information should give you a very basic level understanding of the very easy-to-find information that points in the direction that I am heading with this. In the next few paragraphs, I will speak on the more relevant neurotechnological discoveries and continue to (hopefully) bridge the gap within your mind that these technologies do exist.

Beginning with something that has been confirmed by all governments as a ""mystery"" illness, Havana Syndrome refers to a set of unexplained symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and cognitive issues, reported by diplomats and intelligence officers starting in 2016. While initial theories ranged from stress to viral infections, the lack of a clear cause, combined with the specific neurological symptoms, raised suspicions of a targeted attack. Some experts now suggest the symptoms could result from directed energy weapons, like microwave radiation, which can cause brain injuries and auditory effects. The contradictory explanations and absence of definitive evidence point to the possibility of foul play, potentially involving neuroweapons. My first example is the Canadian government's and many other governments' conclusions that a foreign adversary is ""very unlikely"" to be responsible for Havana Syndrome. This is based on intelligence analysis, open-source information, and scientific literature, which found no credible evidence linking external actors to the reported symptoms. They also considered alternative explanations, such as pre-existing medical conditions and environmental factors, which further diminished the possibility of foreign involvement. However, this contradicts research like that of Balaban et al. (2020), which provided objective evidence of a unique brain injury pattern in those affected by Havana Syndrome. Their study found that individuals with Havana Syndrome exhibited distinct binocular disparity eye and pupil response patterns—different from both those with mild traumatic brain injury and healthy controls. This distinction was identified with over 91% accuracy and suggests that the symptoms may result from a unique form of brain injury, not from conventional illnesses or pre-existing conditions. The findings imply that the syndrome could be linked to a specific cause, possibly an external, targeted factor, rather than the broad explanations favored by the Canadian government.

What else is so special about this information in my case? I exhibit the exact same symptoms shown in these studies—binocular disparity pupillary movements after a ""targeting session."" Now I will take this a step further and explain why these pupillary reactions are so important and why they happen. In short, this technology targets the eyes, more specifically the cones and rods of the retinas. The eyes exhibit very special capabilities. In the studies of Singh et al. (2018), they find the eye to be an antenna capable of receiving microwave radiation, infrared, and ultraviolet, and this is where the communication channel originates. The retina's cones and rods act as cavity resonators or ""high-quality antennas,"" according to Russian researcher Kaznacheev. Through this mechanism, they were able to engineer a system to pass holograms into the visual cortex but not in the visual range (Kaznacheev, 2004). Singh et al. brought out the physics of the human eye as an antenna. Electronic conduction and self-symmetry as in DNA, self-similarity was one of the underlying requirements to make antennas frequency and bandwidth invariant. One of the most basic self-similar structures is that of the Fibonacci sequence, which is found throughout nature but also the human eye, which gives the eye a fractal antenna property. The Fibonacci sequence-based structure or the periodical array of basic physiological units (such as photoreceptors within the retina) is responsible for ""optimizing the signal communication in biological living systems."" Proteins vibrate in the presence of electromagnetic signal like a cavity resonator. Protein synthesis is stimulated by electromagnetic fields of the specific frequency in the RF range (Singh et al. 2018). Cavity resonators are needed to generate and receive microwaves, among other wave frequencies (Caves 1976). Singh also found that the structure within the eye's retina nanocenter is a ""dipole antenna network."" The interaction of a photon beam with this mechanism is considered: ""If a rotation of the light wave underlies the laser emission, then the possibility of helical electron transmission increases; the network of cells acts as an array of helical antennas."" I must mention the use of quantum physics being a very important part of this mechanism, namely the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The helical structures interact with this Aharonov-Bohm effect so that in the human eye this effect is felt and acted upon biologically (Singh et al. 2018). This is an important piece of information when comparing my personal experience with these pupillary effects and the victims of Havana Syndrome.

I would like to speak on other clear physical evidence but aside from the pupillary response there is not much substance to the claims due to the veil of deniability created. There are neuroimaging studies focused on the change in white/gray matter volume. Functional connectivity in the auditory/visual spatial subnets was reduced. The study does not address a specific causality although they do believe some form of pulse-directed microwaves were involved (Verma et al., 2019). The problem with MRI testing is that not many people get them—with only 55.6 exams per 1000 people in Canada—this leaves a vast portion of the population without a reference exam if they were to get tested after the attacks and makes a way for the ""pre-existing"" medical condition deniability scheme. How I relate to this and others with similar brain structure is that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, and the gray/white matter in my brain may resemble that of someone who has been affected by these sophisticated tools, which adds to the layers of deniability and the medication used is very useful to researchers when targeting victims.

John Norseen, an American neuroweapons designer employed by Lockheed-Martin, was one of the first pioneers of ""Thought injection"" or as he termed it, ""Biofusion."" What is Biofusion? It is described as what happens when you think (a precise mathematical operation) to include: when sensors can detect and measure what you think and map where your thoughts are in your brain, and then via ""Information injection,"" monitor, enhance, modify, replace, or prevent neural circuit functions. Sound similar? Yes, this is exactly what the Air Force VISTA document was referring to back in 1994. Now John Norseen was a whistleblower of sorts. He details a lot of his discoveries on a website that catalogues interviews with one of his friends Duncan Laurie, which I will link below that undoubtedly help point us in the right direction.

So how does the rest of it work? This is very difficult to explain but essentially the first part is the ""torsion field"" and generators, which are EM-based antennas (In your personal devices) that use the Aharonov–Bohm effect which can also control vacuum fluctuations (Casimir effect). Here the receiver is a quantum interference receiver, referred to by John Norseen as the human brain, which includes junction superconductor rods (B.O.M 212). The gist of how this works is that electric potentials, not actual force—that is structure minus any weight behind it—imagine a hologram of a punch hitting you. So, they end up transmitting structure but not force, which interacts subtly with matter, leading to reactions and causations which we would not ""normatively"" anticipate to be caused by such low-strength fields.

Dr. Michael Persinger, who was a Canadian pioneer in this field, has written about the Casimir effect and its importance in these interactions. The Casimir effect is a physical force that occurs between two parallel, uncharged, and perfectly conducting plates that are held close together in a vacuum. In a paper on thixotropy—which has to do with the viscosity of water and its impact by EM fields—he presents evidence that thixotropic properties of water could reflect a universal interface for the transformation of virtual particles from zero-point, vacuum oscillations to real particles (Persinger 2015, 6203).

Now knowing that the Aharonov–Bohm generators affect the thixotropy of water (viscosity) and that these generators affect the vacuum, it is important to understand the effect of these generators on water, which plays an important role in controlling the EM within microtubules. A microtubule is a structural component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. It is a cylindrical, tube-like structure made up of tubulin proteins, and it plays a key role in various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, facilitating cell division, and providing structural support for the cell.

Microtubules participate in intracellular signaling by serving as scaffolds for signal transduction pathways and facilitating the transport of signaling molecules within the cell. They also contribute to the cell's shape by forming a rigid framework. They maintain the mechanical stability of the cell and are crucial for the architecture of the cytoplasm—which is to say, our memories, subconscious, and working consciousness. Noting that water's viscosity, thixotropy, loses entropy (non-structure) as viscosity increases—becoming more solid—the harder the structure, the less entropy. A structured network of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and ions in aqueous solutions, when left undisturbed for protracted periods near hydrophilic surfaces, facilitated this condition. Weak magnetic fields of the appropriate temporal configuration could be contained or ""trapped"" within these structure networks (Persinger 2015, 6201). This is caused by the Casimir effect.

The microtubules are controlled by the water inside the MTs. It is now possible to see through Persinger's work how Norseen's thought injection focused on the microtubule could work. Now, the final concept of quantum physics which is crucial to bring this all together: quantum entanglement.

Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle is directly connected to the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This means that when you measure the state of one particle, you immediately know the state of the other, even if they are light-years away. Here's a simple analogy: Imagine you have two magic coins that are entangled. If you flip one coin and it lands heads, the other coin, no matter how far away it is, will automatically land tails when you look at it. The two coins are ""linked,"" and their outcomes are connected instantaneously, even if they're on opposite sides of the universe.

In real quantum entanglement, this connection happens with properties like spin, polarization, or other quantum states, and the effect happens faster than the speed of light, which seems to defy our usual understanding of physics. However, no information is actually transmitted faster than light; it's the connection between the particles that is ""instant.""

The microtubules in the brain are influenced by the water inside them. This is key to understanding how thoughts might be injected or manipulated through quantum processes. Persinger's work connects this idea to quantum effects like entanglement in water. Persinger discusses entanglement velocity, which is the speed at which these connections can occur. For entanglement to happen within the universe, there must be a specific speed that links photon masses (light particles) to energy levels within water. This speed is called the entanglement velocity, and it's related to the physical constants of the universe, like gravity. The energy of about 10\^–20 J (joules) is important because it represents the energy level at which quantum processes in water, such as entanglement, happen. This energy helps with the transformation between virtual particles and entropy (disorder).

Entanglement between two samples of water can be induced by magnetic fields, which exploit the Aharonov–Bohm effect. This is a quantum phenomenon where magnetic fields can affect particles even when they are not directly exposed to the field. The magnetic fields need to change in a very specific way (modulating their phase and frequency) to create entanglement between the water samples. This entanglement lasts about 7 to 8 minutes. For the entanglement to work, the magnetic field has to change in a particular pattern, with alternating increasing and decreasing frequencies and angular velocities. If the conditions are not followed in the right order, or if the magnetic fields stay fixed, the entanglement doesn’t occur. When the right conditions are met, excess correlations (stronger relationships) between the two water samples are observed, and the entanglement effect becomes more significant—even increasing by a factor of 10 under the right circumstances (Persinger 2015, 6207–6209).

**Simply put:**

* The technology creates entanglement between particles.

* Once entangled, changes or states in one particle immediately influence the other.

* This influence can then be harnessed to transfer information related to thoughts or neural states back to the system in question (the human brain).

Now, this is a very simplified explanation of how this works through quantum physics processes through EM fields, but there is one more aspect to this—Quantum LED generators. LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) have been used in modern research to apply these resonance principles to influence biological systems. LED lights, when tuned to specific frequencies, can resonate with biological molecules, bringing out the possibility of monitoring and affecting their function.

Recent advancements in geostationary infrared (IR) remote sensing have shown significant potential for monitoring environmental events, such as dust storms and wildfires, by providing near-continuous, high-temporal-resolution data that helps estimate aerosol concentrations. This capability is primarily due to the ability of geostationary satellites to observe aerosol events both day and night, unlike polar-orbiting satellites, which are limited to daytime observations. By analyzing infrared radiance across multiple channels and applying techniques like high-pass filtering, it’s possible to refine estimates of aerosol composition, particle size, and concentration over time.

These advances also highlight the feasibility of using similar geostationary IR technologies for remote brain monitoring. Just as geostationary satellites can track the duration, spatial extent, and composition of atmospheric events, the same principles could be applied to monitor brain activity through NIR-II imaging. With the potential for near-continuous, non-invasive brain observation, geostationary NIR-II imaging could provide a means for long-term, real-time brain health monitoring, offering high spatio-temporal resolution without the need for physical contact. By understanding the brain's unique infrared autofluorescence and using NIR luminescent probes, this technology could enable continuous tracking of brain function, similar to how geostationary satellites help in environmental monitoring, paving the way for more accessible, large-scale brain health monitoring across diverse settings.

Dr. Irene Cosic developed the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM), which suggests that molecules with the same biological function share similar resonant frequencies. These frequencies allow molecules to interact more effectively and recognize each other. This concept has been applied to studying proteins and cellular signaling pathways (like JAK-STAT, which is involved in cell communication), suggesting that cell signaling might work through resonance, not just chemical or physical interactions.

Irene Cosic herself has described her interest in resonances as stemming from the work of Nikola Tesla, who studied the brain frequencies from 3–69 Hz (Cosic, 2017). From this, she eventually was led to formulate the Cosic Resonant Recognition Model, which was used by Bandyopadhyay to study the EM resonance of microtubules—which is also used by Norseen for ""Thought Injection."" Cosic has defined the RRM in the following: the RRM enables the calculation of these spectral characteristics, by assigning each amino acid a physical parameter representing the energy of delocalized electrons of each amino acid. Comparing Fourier spectra for this energy distribution by using cross-spectral function, it has been found that proteins sharing the same biological function/interaction share the same periodicity (frequency) within energy distribution along the macromolecule.

Furthermore, it has been shown that interacting proteins and their targets share the same characteristic frequency, but have opposite phase at characteristic frequency. Thus, it has been proposed that the RRM frequencies characterize, not only a general function, but also a recognition and interaction between the particular macromolecule and its target, which then can be considered to be resonant recognition. This could be achieved with resonant energy transfer between the interacting macromolecules through oscillations of a physical field, which is electromagnetic in nature (Cosic, 2017). As mentioned, this has been used in modeling MTs. Persinger's group has also had beneficial results through referencing the RRM.

Cosic discovered that spectral analyses (light) of a protein sequence after each constituent amino acid had been transformed into an appropriate pseudopotential predicted a resonant energy between interacting molecules. Several experimental studies have verified the predicted peak wavelength of photons within the visible or near-visible light band for specific molecules. Here, this concept has been applied to a classic signaling pathway, JAK–STAT, traditionally composed of nine sequential protein interactions. The weighted linear average of the spectral power density (SPD) profiles of each of the eight ""precursor"" proteins displayed remarkable congruence with the SPD profile of the terminal molecule (CASP-9) in the pathway. These results suggest that classic and complex signaling pathways in cells can also be expressed as combinations of resonance energies.

The protein interactions can be considered a transfer of resonant energy between interacting molecules through an oscillating physical field that could be expressed within the domain of classic photons. (Persinger, 2015d, 245). It is interesting that the RRM occurs in the frequency range from infrared to visible to ultraviolet waves.

A further implementation of the RRM using LEDs is to use this methodology to fight viruses, not just remotely influence one’s thoughts. Persinger has written on treating viruses using Cosic Resonance with LED lights. In studies, it has been used on Ebola as a model, and could be investigated for Covid-19 (see Persinger 2015b) and others using appropriately patterned monochromatic (narrow band) LED to fight Zika virus (Caceres 2018). Although, as important it is to fight infections and viruses, the most important point as this technology relates to neuroweapons is that it is a viable explanation as to how, without drugs or other direct chemical interdiction, EM waves are able to have a neurological or medical effect.

Dr. Bandyopadhyay, in research funded by the United States Air Force, has explored how electromagnetic frequencies interact with neurons, causing them to produce binary information. When a neuron fires, it experiences thermal fluctuations in the 5–6 THz range (Abbott et al., 1958). Electromagnetic effects on neurons, including their firing rates and ion channel pathways, have been well documented (Camera et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014). Neurons communicate electrically, similar to wireless systems, and their sensitivity to electric fields depends on firing frequency (Katz & Schmitt, 1940; Radman et al., 2007). Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) vibrating at 30 Hz, Dr. Bandyopadhyay observed binary pulses in protein complexes deep inside the axon of a rat hippocampal neuron during firing. These pulses resembled electromagnetic resonance frequency bands (Sahu et al., 2013a,b, 2014; Ghosh et al., 2014). When multiple electrodes and patch clamps were used, a new form of communication was observed between neurons, where resonance frequency peaks grouped together, echoing the principle that ""neurons that fire together wire together."" This observation revealed complex resonance bands across a broad frequency range, from microhertz to terahertz, which had not been explored in such detail before (Bandyopadhyay, 2016).

**How it fits together:**

1. The eyes retina acts as a High Quality antenna

2. The torsion field creates specific electromagnetic environment that makes biological systems, particularly water and microtubules, more susceptible to external electromagnetic influences (like those from LEDs) as well as information transfer.

3. LED lights, tuned to specific frequencies, could then interact with biological molecules or neural structures (such as microtubules) to influence their function. This interaction could be enhanced by the electromagnetic conditions created by the torsion field.

4. The overall idea is that these subtle electromagnetic interactions (through resonance, entanglement) could influence thoughts, neural processes, or even consciousness, aligning with the notion of neuroweapons that use electromagnetic fields to manipulate mental states

Despite criticisms claiming that electromagnetic fields cannot influence molecular activity or that line-of-sight is needed for targeting, historical scientific and social evidence points to the possibility of neuroweapons and their real-world applications. These criticisms overlook the potential for electromagnetic signals to penetrate objects and affect biological systems in unexpected ways.",1mn7nlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1mn7nlz/mind_control_tech_references_in_comments/,0

He touts whole-virus vaccines as a more robust alternative, even though there is robust data that shows that the whole-virus vaccine developed in China was substantially less effective, albeit just as safe as mRNA vaccines.

I suspect that for an antivaxer in power, moving backwards from modern mRNA-tailored vaccines to traditional vaccines under the fallacious premise of it being a more natural and holistic solution, is but the first step in regressing to the elimination of vaccines altogether -because what could be more natural than natural immunity? Natural selection.

In response to what is likely to become a growing interest in justifying scientifically illiterate solutions to biological problems via the appeal to nature fallacy, I wrote a short essay about how divided from reality that opinion is.

skeptic,diet69dr420pepper,1754412031.0,Elephants in Rooms: a more subtle propaganda,"I found this channel a while ago and was at first excited by it. It appeared to take a sincere and unbiased approach towards analyzing impolite subjects. In time, I have come around to thinking this is probably conservative apologia, and it's deployed in a way intended to reach politically neutral, apathetic, or truly centrist viewers. I find this insidious.

The video formula is straightforward. Some controversial-sounding topic is select and the creator, Ken, discusses the history of and arguments around the subject. He invariably finds a nugget of truth grounding the subject, while rebutting extreme conclusions about it. This leaves the viewer with the feeling that there is definitely something to this, but that we don't have high certainty about how deep the rabbit hole goes.

This is not necessarily problematic provided the research is good and the take is fair. The research might be good and the take may be fair, I have no verified any of it. But this is problematic when nearly every topic selected is conservative-coded. You can break this down into themes. There are critiques of liberal elites/governments, with videos like *Does George Soros secretly pull the strings?*, *Everyone lied about COVID, why?*, and *Why did the elites open America's border?.* He gives critical takes on progressive social movements with videos like *Did the #MeToo Movement Go Too Far?, How did we go from ""fat positivity"" to promoting death?,* and *What killed the transgender movement?*. And this trending continues for basically every topic he interacts with. Anyone viewing his library would get the idea that gender essentialism and traditional gender roles are basically correct, Western cultural values are basically superior, and neoconservative political stances are essentially reasonable (particularly with respect to Israel). 

Even if his analysis is fair and accurate, taking all of these topics and showing that they're 75% nonsense still amounts to showing they are 25% sense. So if all topics chosen are either neutral or affirm a right-leaning worldview, then the aggregate effect of the channel is to advance this right-leaning worldview.

Now it's entirely possible that it's simply true, the far right is grounded on a set of politically incorrect truths that the the left is simply too propagandized to examine critically and these elephants in the room highlight that. But the problem is that there as many or more of these awkward discussions to be had about the right. As examples:

Why do conspiracy theories thrive in conservative spaces? 

Did the Koch brothers buy the Supreme Court? 

Did anti-Woke become a grift? 

Is Critical Race Theory really in your kids' classrooms? 

Who profits from school choice?

Why do CEOs keep getting richer during recessions?

When Did Criticizing Police Become Un-American?

Who Benefits from Border Panic?

Answer any of these questions would be pretty embarrassing for conservatives, even if you come up with the typical 25% truth, 75% hype split after you dig into them. There are a litany of irrational moral panics, strange irrationalities, and media-driven lies which characterize mainstream or alt-right thinking. Yet *none* are examined despite perfectly aligning with the stated purpose of the channel, after almost 200 videos. Why?

Imo, it's because this channel is fundamentally persuasive in nature. It has nothing to do with the critical analysis of controversial topics and everything to do with smuggling a right-wing worldview onto people who will be skeptical of extreme rhetoric.

US CDC: The risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered low. 

There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people. There have been a few reports of infected mammalian animals spreading the virus to people during close contact, but this is rare. These cases include farmed mink in Europe and the United States, white-tailed deer in Canada, pet hamsters in Hong Kong, and a cat in Thailand. In most of these cases, the animals were known to be first infected by a person who had COVID-19.

It’s important to remember that people are much more likely to get COVID-19 from other people than from animals.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html


In the opinion of top experts on Sarbecovirus emergence including Linfa Want, Peter Dasczak and Shi Zhengli, there was negligible chance of zoonosis in Wuhan. How do we know this? They used Wuhan blood samples as negative control sera in a Sarbecovirus exposure study. It they thought there was any chance of zoonosis in Wuhan, they would have used different blood samples as a negative control set. 

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6178078/#:~:text=Wuhan%2C%20where%20the%20negative%20control%20sera%20were%20collected

The latest paper on the subject purported to prove that animals, presumably racoon dogs, originally infected humans twice at the Huanan Market, leading to the Covid pandemic. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39303692/

As confirmed by the CDC above, it is extremely rare for humans to be infected with COVID by an animal, requiring extremely close contact. The latest highly-cited paper that claimed to have proven a market origin of COVID estimated that the virus jumped not just once, a highly-unlikely event, but twice, over a two week period in December 2019. 

To get an idea of how likely this was to occur, we need to know how many racoon dogs were sold at the market. Surely, it must have been teeming with thousands of racoon dogs, for two viral jumps to have happened in which succession? It turns out there were hardly any racoon dogs at the market, or in Wuhan at all. The virologist Holmes visited the market in 2014 and saw 2 lonely racoon dogs, providing a clue, but fortunately, some scientists front he Wuhan CDC in the next block to the market had been monitoring the wildlife trade there extremely closely in the 2 years prior to the pandemic, and recorded an monthly average of 38 racoon dogs sold in the whole of Wuhan. Given that 7 of the 17 stalls selling wildlife in Wuhan were at the market, presumably, fewer than 20 racoon dogs passed through the market in a typical month. 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352192043_Animal_sales_from_Wuhan_wet_markets_immediately_prior_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic

Considering that, according to the China WHO report, roughly 10000 people visited the market every day, or 300000 per month, it is on the order of 15000 times more likely that humans were the source of the environmental virus contamination that was observed at the market. 

Contrast this to the November 2002 SARS outbreak. There were 5 index cases in 5 different municipalities in Guangdong. China eventually reported the outbreak to the WHO after covering it up for 4 months. A large number of animals handlers, and the majority of civets tested were seropositive for SARS-COV antibodies, with independent testing and verification by international scientists. 

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7169858/

In the case of COVID, China did not release results of either of these critical tests, 
Guangzhou was known to consume 86,000 civets per year, or around 7200 per month, i.e. approximately 360 times greater than the few racoon dogs sold in Wuhan. 

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3233/EPL-201008

The claimed timeline for natural emergence at the market is also highly implausible. It is postulated that China successfully identified an outbreak of a virus that either has no symptoms, or symptoms identical to a cold or flu, in the middle of the cold and flu season, within 3 weeks of it starting. The China CDC estimated over 500000 cases in Wuhan using serology studies, which is ten times higher than the number of cases that were detected, so the reported cases associated with the market were likely the tip of the iceberg, and were highly unlikely to have been amongst the first actual cases.

An alternative explanation would be an escape of a virus being studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the world's top laboratory for the study of the type of exotic virus on the loose, which had access to samples viruses and bats from all over SE Asia, where the wild related viruses are found.

https://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2021/12/07/from-laos-to-wuhan-wcw-foia-investigation-sheds-light-on-pandemics-origins/

Those who have not read much about the origin of COVID are frequently unaware of how common serious laboratory accidents are. For example, SARS escaped twice from a laboratory in Beijing over a two week period in April 2004, so lab escape of a pathogen under study is a realistic scenario, with many precedents. 

https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-spotlight-20040427-03

Lab escape would explain how the authorities were able to identify the virus so quickly, despite it being extremely hard to notice against the background of the cold and flu season - they knew what to look for.  

In summary, the CDC has shown that animals are highly unlikely to transmit Covid to humans, and there were hardly any susceptible animals in Wuhan, so an animal origin is highly unlikely, and we must look elsewhere for the source. In contrast, due to the vast volume of the wildlife trade in Guangdong, the main destination for imported wildlife from SE Asian and Yunnan, where the wild viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 are found, and where it is traditional to eat wildlife, due to the large numbers of animals involved, an outbreak was relatively far likelier than in Wuhan, which, according to Shi Zhengli, the famous Batlady of Wuhan, would be the last place she would have expected a natural outbreak to occur!",1med9ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1med9ry/was_it_more_likely_humans_or_animals_brought/,0

skeptic,Any_Command8461,1753688530.0,Parents (especially mother) around 60 y/o gone down conspiracy rabbit hole,"I would like to preface this post by stating who I am and my current situation, and then move on to the specific misinformation sources that I would to (hopefully) counter logically and solidly.

I (20M) am a current university student working towards getting my BSc with a major in Computer Science and a minor in cybersecurity studies. Although this is unrelated, I genuinely love my studies and I really enjoy being in the faculty of science at my university as I am always learning new things in any number of subjects, and I get to work with really amazing professors who are experienced and passionate in their areas of study. My enjoyment with my studies however, has not come without a downside, which is coming from my own household. I was recently (formally) diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, and I've been wanting to try new ways to help me focus within my studies. I would like to try some therapeutic medications like Adderall, however my parents, mostly my mother, has been very negative towards the idea.

My mother (around 60), has in my opinion, spent too much time on social media. Her highest level of education is high school and she has worked in different level positions in the government throughout her life. She used to be a very aggressive professional who was purely fact based and didn't pay any mind to what I would describe as destructive crap on the internet. We were involved in a drink driving accident around 10 years ago however, which left her with permanent pain and resulting insomnia. While in recent time it isn't nearly as bad, she is still unemployed, and thus has alot of time on her hands. 

One of her positions in the government was communications within the provincial health department, where she aided with the creation of a pandemic plan after the H1-N1 pandemic happened. To sum a great deal of events, when covid hit, our government failed to enact certain parts of the plan. When covid first started she was very vigilant about the whole thing, listening to credible sources and being generally cautious. She was actually one of the first people to start masking up. Our government however, acted too late to prevent the spread of the virus to a great amount of the population. This is when she started getting into conspiracy theories, and when in my opinion, the paranoia started.

She began watching Instagram posts for information all the time, and due to their profit driven algorithms, she was spoon fed more and more misinformation and the tap of the finger. I honestly blame myself for not stepping in earlier to prevent her from just believing everything she sees. To be fair it could also be the lack of education as in the level of education she obtained, there is essentially nothing taught about vetting sources and chosing what to base an argument on. As a university student, all of my sources that I source in my papers have to be scholarly, peer-reviewed articles from a credible publisher. I've essentially had to learn how to vet my sources incredibly well as any holes in an argument I make will be found. She has not had this type of education and thus does not know what is a requirement of a solid argument. I have tried to explain the process many times to her to no avail. She has gone so far down the rabbit hole, she believes that anything that is common knowledge and frequently researched is a lie. One example being when I was taking a geology course (elective), I would tell her how interesting the creation of continental crust over a course of millions of years was quite interesting, and she would counter by saying that they're ""teaching me lies"" and the earth is ""6000 years old at most"". This is how she essentially counters any argument, by calling it lies. I don't even understand her thought process as at that point you can just call anything a lie, you can say the sky is green during the day and claim that anyone that says its blue is lying.

One of the biggest sources that she gets information from is this Dr. Lorraine Day who seems to be another one of these career conspiracy theorists who uses their title to pass on misinformation as fact much like the famous John Campbell, although in my opinion this Dr. Day figure is much more extreme. Dr. Day has since passed away but her site is still up and there are many of her videos floating around. She also takes this style of conspiracy analysis to the Bible aswell; by creating some sort of misconstrued interpretation of the Bible that from what I've heard from friends that have tried to debate her on it is also far off, although that's definitely not a hill I'm willing to die on as in my opinion religion is completely enshrouded in make belief.

From this Dr. Day figure, she has made claims herself that all religions are secretly evil (meh probably not far off anyway), vaccines cause autism and the covid vaccine is a death shot. Apparently aswell she believes the covid 19 tests with the q tip are the same as the vaccine aswell as the q tip has some sort of microchip that breaks the blood brain barrier (just gagged a bit while writing that as I literally work in tech and that is the most sci-fi sounding thing ever). She also believes that all commercial airlines are ""spraying chemicals trails"", which apparently have a wide range of effects from changing the weather, killing people, and causing wild fires. Funnily enough my one cousin who was literally an airline pilot and knows current airline pilots also believes this even though he doesn't know how planes would fit tanks containing the ""spray"". I've tried to explain the simple science of high altitude low temperatures and shown her little experiments that prove that exhaust gas burning at high altitude will leave water vapor in the form of contrails, she still refuses to accept the truth. She also believes that all medications are ""poison"" and you only need God to fix everything, to which i usually respond tell that to those people with type 1 diabetes, guess they'll die if they dont prey enough.

Essentially I'm making this post almost as a cry for help as she has gone so far off the deep end I just don't know what to do. I love her and she's always been very supportive but I can't even talk normal to her for a second without her bringing this crap up. This came to a head a couple months ago as I was trying an antidepressant for some personal issues I was having at the time, I decided it would be best if I didn't tell her. For some reason she was in my room and found them which quite literally made her hysterical. I couldn't go ahead day without her essentially saying I was poisoning myself with them. I later quit them as I didn't really care for the side effects I was having on them. I've been recently wanting to try some medication for my ADHD and I decided to tell her beforehand so there isn't any surprises and that might've been a mistake. First the waterworks then the ""oh well try these millions of these unregulated vitamins from whereever"". I'm honestly just exhausted, I just feel like ignoring her every time she brings up that stuff and moving on. Does anyone have any tips or advice, maybe some information on this Dr. Day person?

skeptic,Born-Requirement2128,1753112932.0,Exclusive: Inside the WHO mission to Wuhan,"This essay reported the impressions of the WHO team who visited Wuhan in January 2021, over a year after the COVID pandemic started, when the Chinese government finally agreed to allow a WHO inspection. 

Notably, the international WHO team all had the impression they were being lied to by the Chinese scientists, due to political pressure from above, when they asked questions about animals being sold at the market. They were right to be skeptical, given the Chinese government is well-known for making up data to fit its narrative, e.g., the reported 121,000 Covid deaths, which was over an order of magnitude lower than any plausible number, so a clear fabrication, and wanted to avoid any embarrassing information being known to the WHO, and hence, the rest of the world.

Given this, it seems the WHO international team abandoned all skepticism when asking questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and instead were were extraordinarily trusting of the information given to them by China. 

For example, regarding the reported staff with flu-like symptoms, the WHO team notes:
“Are you seriously saying that, during the peak of flu season, no one would have gotten sick at all?” WIV is a big institute with many people; epidemiologically, this did not make sense. “I just find that very, very hard to believe,”.

Similarly, the zero COVID infections amongst WIV staff reported by China is also epidemiologically implausible, since China CDC estimated around 500000 infections in its serology studies of Wuhan residents,and the WIV had 600+, enough to make the chances of none of them being infected zero. China clearly lying to the WHO about at least two important topics in the report calls into question all of the data in the whole China/WHO report, which notably include the timeline and maps of early cases that were used in studies in the origin of COVID.

There are other points where the author has unfounded confidence in the veracity of China's narrative about the lab, for example, he takes it at face value that the WIV published sampled viruses as soon as possible, and had published all of the viruses in its collection in a mid 2020 paper, stating that that proves they could not have had any unknown viruses in their collection that could have given rise to COVID. This is demonstrably untrue, as the WIV published a further 56 novel coronaviruses from its collection in December 2024, sampled between 2004 and 2021. 

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03982-2

Altogether, this demonstrates that the information in the China/WHO report are unlikely to be a true or complete account of the early cases or background of COVID, and that skeptics should be extra skeptical of information on the topic released by the Chinese government, which were likely subject to political direction, and the conclusion of any papers based on those data, which include the main papers arguing for a zoonotic origin of COVID, such as Worobey 2024. The correct interpretation is that the origin is unknown, due to a lack of high-quality data on the matter, due to the Chinese government's obfuscation.",1m5mikw,https://www.protagonist-science.com/p/exclusive-inside-the-who-mission,7

This conclusion is grounded in substantial evidence regarding how aluminum disrupts neurological development, particularly in infants with vulnerable systems. Below, I’ve outlined the CDC vaccine schedule with specific aluminum exposure amounts, totaling 8.425 mg over 18 years, with the majority administered in the first few years of life. I’ve also included a detailed breakdown from my 10,000-word thesis, written in clear, accessible language for an educated lay audience. The focus is on aluminum’s impact on the brain’s energy systems, supported by data and presented with a serious tone. This is a call to stop these aluminum-containing vaccines based on the evidence. Review the details below, and share your insights or additional research in the comments.

CDC Vaccine Schedule with Aluminum Content (Source: vaccine.guide/vaccine-schedule-inserts/)

Hepatitis B (HepB): 3 doses (birth, 1-2 months, 6-18 months), 0.5 mg per dose = 1.5 mg total
DTaP/DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis): 5 doses (2, 4, 6 months, 15-18 months, 4-6 years), 0.625 mg per dose = 3.125 mg total
Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b): 4 doses (2, 4, 6, 12-15 months), 0.225 mg per dose = 0.9 mg total
PCV (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine): 4 doses (2, 4, 6, 12-15 months), 0.125 mg per dose = 0.5 mg total
Hepatitis A (HepA): 2 doses (12-23 months), 0.45 mg per dose = 0.9 mg total
HPV (Human Papillomavirus): 3 doses (11-12 years), 0.5 mg per dose = 1.5 mg total
Total Aluminum a Child Receives: 8.425 mg—much of it administered before age 3, a critical window for brain development.
Detailed Analysis from Thesis: Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Are Causing Neurodivergent Disorders

Introduction and Core Assertion: This analysis asserts that aluminum adjuvants in childhood vaccines are a primary cause of neurodivergent disorders, including autism and ADHD. The evidence points to aluminum’s interference with neurological development, particularly when administered to infants in doses totaling 8.425 mg over 18 years, with the bulk delivered before age 3. This discussion is crafted for an educated audience, dissecting data and mechanisms to underscore the urgent need to stop aluminum-containing vaccines.

Evidence Implicating Aluminum: The case against aluminum rests on clear patterns. The timing of vaccine administration—concentrated in the first 2-3 years—aligns with the emergence of disorders like autism. Animal studies show early aluminum exposure results in behavioral anomalies akin to neurodivergent traits, such as impaired social interaction. Human research highlights brain inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in affected individuals, damages consistent with aluminum’s neurotoxic profile. The rise in disorder prevalence over recent decades correlates with expanded vaccine schedules, positioning aluminum as a likely causal factor.

Cellular Energy Systems—A Battery Analogy: Envision the body as a device powered by a battery. Mitochondria in cells serve as these batteries, transforming nutrients and oxygen into ATP, the energy essential for brain function and growth. This process depends on minerals like magnesium and iron, comparable to critical circuit components. The developing brain, a major energy consumer, relies on efficient mitochondrial operation. Any disruption can impair neural connectivity, especially in early life.

Aluminum’s Interference with Energy Systems: Aluminum acts as a destructive force within this system. Post-injection, it circulates and, in infants, can breach the brain. It disrupts mitochondrial function by displacing essential minerals and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and cellular damage. This energy deficit impairs neural development, contributing to disorders.

Infant Brain Vulnerability: Infants face heightened risk due to an immature blood-brain barrier, which fails to shield the central nervous system from toxins like aluminum. Coupled with underdeveloped detoxification mechanisms, aluminum accumulates in the brain during critical developmental windows, amplifying its neurotoxic impact.

Aluminum as a Cause of Neurodivergent Disorders: The evidence is strong: aluminum from vaccines plays a central role in causing autism, ADHD, and related conditions. The alignment of exposure with disorder onset, biological findings of inflammation and energy deficits, animal models replicating outcomes, and epidemiological trends mirroring increased vaccine usage all support this conclusion. Aluminum’s neurotoxicity manifests as developmental impairment, necessitating its removal from vaccines.

Addressing Counterarguments: Critics argue that aluminum exposure from vaccines is negligible compared to dietary sources or that it is safely excreted. These claims don’t hold: injected aluminum bypasses gastrointestinal filters, and infant systems struggle to eliminate it. Safety thresholds are questionable for developing brains, reinforcing the need to stop aluminum use.

Conclusion: The data shows that 8.425 mg of aluminum, primarily administered before age 3, disrupts cellular energy systems and causes neurodivergent disorders through sustained brain damage. Infant vulnerability heightens this threat. Given the timing, biological impacts, and rising rates, aluminum adjuvants must be discontinued to prevent further harm.

When one of my wife's friends mentioned something about Bill Gates and nanobots, I just about lost my shit I was so annoyed at her. 


Having said that - my wife and I were both triple vaxxed for covid. 

Not long after her 3rd dose, (I think it was a different vaccine than the first two times) my wife went in for regular blood work since she had a new GP and he wanted her baselines.

She got a call a few days later from him.   ""Did you know you have diabetes?""

Not exactly the best bedside manner.  

We didn't really believe it could be true so she got tested again. Same result. 

Her pancreas was still functioning enough to just be on metformin for a while - the Dr even said it might be type 2. (she is not the profile for type 2 at all)   We paid to get the T1 vs T2 test done, and sure enough she was T1.

No symptoms ever until that random blood work.   And then over the following weeks, it became apparent that she was producing less and less insulin every week.  She was on a glucose monitor and a pump within a month. 

I really feel for her - 40 year's old and a T1 diagnosis.  It's rare but still happens that late i life.

Then I stumble across a post someone made about vaccines and how they can trigger a dormant autoimmune disease. 

I look into it, through real medical  journals and sure enough.  There is some evidence of that happening.  

The timing made sense as well. 

Neither of us caught covid until after her diagnosis, so it wasn't the virus that triggered it. And it might not even have been the vaccine that did.  But this is the issue.  There IS growing evidence that it can happen. But even every paper you read says ""the greater risk is catching Covid, and the risk of an autoimmune disease being triggered is very low, so it's best to get vaccinated.""

But, tell that to my wife now. 

And this is now a topic of conversation that intelligent people don't want to have.  

And I get it.   There are some fringe lunatics out there, that blame vaccines for everything. But as i trusted the doctors about the efficacy and safety, I trust these doctors doing this research as well that perhaps there is more than a 0% risk of what happened to my wife happening.

Now is it possible that nothing triggered it and it was a coincidence?  Yes.   But the lack of ability to have the conversation with people that can get out of their extreme view point one side of the other is really frustrating.

No question - just a rant.  Maybe a kick off for a conversation with other critical thinkers.",1lxgdbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1lxgdbw/as_a_lifelong_skeptic_ive_run_into_a_nuanced/,0

conspiracy,HTXPhoenix,1760381246.0,The number 33 and its significance,"33 is the highest degree of freemasonry, and many of us who research into things know that many top Freemasons to have high worldly positions and run most of the world. This number is also placed in a lot of media and news stories that we consume, and I’ll give many examples later on.


“Jesus was crucified at age 33, seen as the fulfillment of prophecies and redemption plans. King David reigned for 33 years in Jerusalem, symbolizing the peak of Israel's unity.”

* Islam: The number 33 is used in prayer beads, with 33 beads in a set, to count the 99 names of God in the Qur'an.

* Buddhism: In Buddhist tradition, there is a story of the ""Trayastrimsha Heaven,"" which refers to 33 heavens or gods where the Buddha descended from.

* ﻿﻿Master Number: 33 is considered a ""Master Number"" in numerology, signifying spiritual guidance, compassion, and creativity.

Numerology: The number 33 is a significant number in numerology and various spiritual and religious traditions, representing a powerful Master Number associated with spiritual growth, compassion, and ""God's promises"". It symbolizes high levels of spiritual awareness, creativity, and the intersection of the divine and physical realms

* Symbolic connections: The 33 vertebrae in the human spine, the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and the 33 feathers on the wings of the Egyptian goddess Maat are other symbolic instances. 

•	The atomic number of arsenic is 33.


Below is a post I have read on a take of this number. But I’d also like to hear opinions from others and feedback. I’ve been doing a lot of research on this number lately. And one thing for sure is there is significance to it, and they plant it in everything we consume 


“I believe freemasonry at the highest level is actually Satanic for various reasons, including whom they worship and how, the ceremonies performed by only 33° masons, whom they hate, and whom they associate with. So for me it’s no stretch of the imagination to think the number 33 represents the 1/3 of the angels that fall from heaven. 1/3 is 33.3 or 33 I don’t believe for one second that was coincidence but a deliberate choice. The more I dive into the highest degrees of freemasonry and their associates the more it points to worshiping Satan. Now mind you, not all masons know this. Most don’t. The system is basically a method for separating the wheat from the chaff. At the very highest levels, they teach you about Lucifer, how to conjure him and his kind with horrendous sex magic and literal sacrifices, (sometimes human, especially male children). They refer to normal uninitiated people as “vulgar, profane and fools” especially the Christian and atheist.

don’t take my word for it. Research. Look up some 33° masons from the past and look into the books they’ve written. Allistier Crowley for example. Or Manny P. Hall a 33° free mason in his book “the lost keys of free masonry” wrote “when the mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his craft. The seething, surging energies of Lucifer are in his hands, and before he may step onward and upward he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.” This is just one of hundreds of examples from 33° masons writing like this. They serve Satan, and literally practice magic with sex and blood. Follow the leaders. Look at their works and affiliates.

many will claim it’s not exclusively a satanist cult or they favor one religion over another, but many of their own have been fooled. As I stated before it is a system designed to separate the weak or doubtful. Only at the top do you truly learn. Even its swearing in is satanic and or evil. But for any Christian who thinks being a mason is ok remember this. “A servant can not serve two masters.” so the very secret oath you take to join them being evil, means you’re not serving the true God Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Understanding this helped me realize what the 33 was for.”

“for separating the wheat from the chaff. At the very highest levels, they teach you about Lucifer, how to conjure him and his kind with horrendous sex magic and literal sacrifices, (sometimes human, especially male children). They refer to normal uninitiated people as “vulgar, profane and fools” especially the Christian and atheist.


Are satanists running the world and 33 is their number, and what they mock us with?


Now also here is a bunch of examples of this number being used constantly in media we consume, in ways that don’t seem like a coincidence, and given the established significance of the number we already know, seem to be purposely placed. Now also, some of these very may well be actually coincidences. After all, of course 33 will show up in events naturally occurring, but let’s also look at all of these cases because it might seem interesting of their occurrence.



Every example I have listed I will post a direct link in another post below to the information.

There was also a video i have seen of a detective who was announcing Charlie Kirk’s killer to be found, and when he was reading on the podium, when he looked at his next line to read, he turned his head to the left and laughed and said That Kirk’s killer was found in 33 hours. Is laugh was right before reading our 33.

Of course, this wasn’t true. US social media PsyOp Units were behind it, pushing people towards Pfizer vaccines instead, not because it was better, but because it came from the right side.

But don’t think this is an exclusively American playbook, dear anti-Americans in this sub. Russian foreign media, PsyOp social media units, and russian troll farms pushed a similar kind of fear. Western vaccines were said to be “laced with 5G microchips,” “tracking devices,” or part of some “Bill Gates master plan.” Their propaganda wasn’t purely anti-vaccine at first, it was specifically anti–Western vaccine. Sputnik, the Russian-made vaccine, was hailed as the only true vaccine that actually worked.

But when Russian foreign media noticed that no one outside Russia wanted Sputnik, their messaging shifted. They became broadly anti-vaccine, but only for foreign audiences!!. If you read Russian state media meant for domestic consumption, they were never anti-vaccine. In fact, they mocked anti-vaxxers as stupid or mentally ill. Russia only wanted westerners to be anti-vax, not their people.

Different lies, same goal: global influence.

Everyone here thinks they’re making informed choices, but most of us were just caught in someone else’s game.

This is actively happening right now as we speak: DIGITAL ID! is slowly and surely being made mandatory ALL across the globe 🌎.

This is NOT the *MARK OF THE BEAST* , HOWEVER, This IS the medium/system that will be used in order to distribute/enforce the *MARK OF THE BEAST* 

- At the time of this post *""The State Bank of Vietnam""* has already shut down *86 million* out of *101 million* bank accounts due to population refusal of DIGITAL ID .. Which has been and WILL be deliberately interlinked with your:

- finances, spending habits
- food, 
- health/medical information 
- social security
- travel, 
- social media activity, 
- search history, 
- purchase history 
- location history 
- political stance 
- world views, etc 

So far the DIGITAL ID is being rolled out by the Global Elite slowly, surely and quietly (if you've noticed more services requiring online age verification or identity verification for ANY of the day to day services you use, then that is it appearing in deceit).

Just like vaccine passports, it started off masquerading as something that was *""optional""* .. until they made it *""mandatory""* .. and that was a dress rehearsal compared to what is on it's way.

So far, at the time of this post, the following countries have succumbed to the pressures from the Global Elite and are currently implementing MANDATORY DIGITAL ID's for everyday use:

- Certain parts of the Caribbean like Jamaica 🇯🇲 and Barbados 🇧🇧 
- Certain parts of Asia, like Vietnam 🇻🇳, Thailand 🇹🇭 and Indonesia 🇮🇩 
- Certain parts of Africa, namely the West and the South (are in the implementing stages)
- United Kingdom 🇬🇧 (in the form of the *""BRIT CARD""* which Starmer has already gone on record saying it WILL BE MANDATORY and that nobody shall *""buy, sell or work""* without it
- and ofcourse  .. United States of America 🇺🇸 (Silently changing TOC's and proposing DIGITAL verification options under the guise of *""security and convenience""* just to misuse said information later on for MANDATORY DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION

More countries are adopting a ONE FOR ALL DIGITAL ID this very minute, I believe Australia 🇦🇺 are trying very hard to rally against it but will eventually succumb like the rest of the world 🌎

conspiracy,ManicPixieDreadGirl_,1760215538.0,Amazon racist hack during covid - does anyone remember this?,"I'm 1000000% certain this is a real memory. A couple of my friends have vague recollection of it - I remember taking screenshots as evidence but can't find anything in my iCloud. I've looked it up a few times in the past couple of years and there are no news reports I can find

Sometime during covid lockdown (I think it was 2020, small chance it couldve been 2021), I remember opening the Amazon (UK) app and seeing that every single product listing had been compromised. I scrolled page after page and the titles and/or the images to every product had been changed to racist slurs. (Im pretty sure it was anti black racism but not fully certain. Theres a chance I'm conflating the memory of the hack with the BLM discourse at the time. If it wasn't that though, it was definitely some other extremely overtly offensive hate speech - the kinda stuff I'm sure would get flagged by automatic content filters if you tried to manually post it.) 

I remember scrolling through the app while showing my flatmate and taking screenshots. We were so shook that a hacker could get that much access to Amazon and pull off something so audacious without being stopped. I kept checking the news convinced they would break the massive hacking story any minute but we never heard a peep about it from any source ever. My iCloud has been scrubbed of the evidence.

Please tell me someone else witnessed or remembers this? For all I know the hack could've only lasted a couple mins and I was just lucky to stumble across it. But the fact the screenshots have been scrubbed from my devices is kinda terrifying - they must've hacked any witnesses like me and silenced the media

Who would even have motivation to do something like this? A racist? I mean I guess but seems like a lot of trouble just to troll BLM. And what would Amazon have to do with it, they're certainly not BLM supporters or anti racism campaigners. I wonder if it was some kind of warning or taunt towards Amazon and if what I saw was just surface evidence of a much bigger more compromising plot? I know they have motive to hide the story to protect their profits/reputation but we've seen reporting on AWS and other corporate hacks before. What made this one so different?

Palantir AI surveillance trap, the Revelation end of world prophecies (plans) & crimes against humanity exposed. 

The following information was spoken by Tommy Williams from the truth honour and integrity show. 

“The leader of the group palantir called Peter Thiel, the Jewish billionaire investor in data AI, defense and weapons development technology companies, wants everyone to think more about the end of the world with a dire warning. And Remember, they have to tell you in some way, and often it is wrapped up in code.

For about a year now, thiel has been publicly laying out his understanding of biblical prophecies. But is actually the potential for a rapid advance of technology to bring about an apocalyptic future, of which he and his Jewish buddies and Trump are a part of it. If he's worried about an apocalyptic future, why is he at the forefront of one of the worst companies directing It?

(Thiel stated in a lecture on Monday that whether in AI or other forms of technology, fearing or rejecting it, or opposing technological progress would hasten the coming of the Antichrist, thiel said). 

No that is reptilian reverse speak, it will bring in the anti Christ. The Anti Christ is what they're revealing. But as they attempt their anti Christ, we have brought in the Cosmic Christ template to do battles on many planes, and likely including this one.

Thiel is expanding on a number of speeches and public interviews he's given about the Antichrist in a closed four part lecture series this month in San Francisco, and he is a number among a number of Silicon Valley figures who have recently spoken more openly about their faith, a contrast to the cultural milieu of the epicenter of the tech world, which is mostly secular. And this is how Thiel says the end of the world might happen.

Now, This is not how it might happen. You have to understand they hide behind biblical prophecies when these or those are their ACTUAL PLANS, that is what is playing out. So you've got all these people citing revelation, but actually they're manifesting their plans for them. 

(Thiel said, essential risk will present themselves in the form of nuclear war, environmental disaster, dangerously engineered bio weapons and Even autonomous killer robots guided by artificial intelligence.  As humans race towards the last battle, the Armageddon, one world government will form, promising peace and safety, thiel said)

NOW, Armageddon is the Jewish (Zionist) plan bringing in the Messiah. The Messiah is Lucifer andor Yahweh, and they think they will be saved. They won't. I can guarantee that, in thiel's reckoning, this totalitarian authoritarian regime will be the coming of the modern day antichrist, all facilitated by his palantir company, a figure defined in Christian teachings as the personal opponent of God who will appear before the world ends.

However, Which God, though, because if you think and manifest the God of the Bible, then we are all in trouble, and it's typical Jewish (Zionist) psychotic thinking and behavior. But their day of reckoning is coming, and it might not be what they are expecting. 

Part 2 

This is about the exposure of palantir and the dangerous ramifications for us all from the company of mass control abuse of freedoms and crimes perpetuate perpetrated against humanity. 

Palantir software was used by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and re Investment Act. Specifically the Recovery Operations Center use Palantir to integrate transactional data with open source and private data sets that describe the entities receiving stimulus funds.
In Other words, to give people stimulus funds and they want to investigate them for open source was created by a private company, but still under the umbrella of the CIA by the alt media character Robert David Steele, who was a former CIA assassin, and yet, remarkably, many of The awake followed him, thinking he was a white hat.

Now all the clients as of 2019 included the Polaris Project, how funny, the CDC, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Institutes of Health team, Rubicon, a fake medical team that went in Haiti and actually stole the children and also the United Nations World Food Program.

Now in October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of covid 19 vaccines across the country, that was before the jabs came out. So they were then on the vaccine scam designed to clearly harm the people. That is no longer a conspiracy. The evidence produced so far renders it an absolute fact, us, military intelligence and police are next. Palantir Gotham is used by counter terrorism analysts are officers in the United States intelligence community and also the United States Departments of Defense. Fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and cyber analysts at information warfare monitor, and they were responsible for the ghost net and shadow network investigation, both accusing the Chinese of spying, which is highly ironic as palantir do the same to Americans and many more.

Now, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015 other clients as of 2013 included the DHS, NSA, FBI, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command West Point, the joint IED Defeat Organization and allies. However, at the time, the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool also, According to TechCrunch, the US spy agencies also employed palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually.

Now everything is linked together using palantir. You do realize they are taking over the whole web with this technology and software, everything is connected and being condensed like a web, trapping all the prey. The prey is us.
“ - Tommy Williams. 

“Symbols, numbers and naming, like ""Palantir"" which word comes from Quenya palan 'far', and tir 'watch over' = to watch from far away. The name are taken from the crystal ball used in Lord of the Rings by the evil wizard Sauron. Palantiri are a sinister symbol of hubris and a tool of manipulation. Any company choosing to name themselves after a MasterStone used by a 'Dark Maga Lord' should ring a warning bell! The largest shareholder of Palantir is also Vanguard... you know ""BlackRock""... It is said that even the very wise could be deceived by what they saw in the palantir serpent stone and also by the using of the magic orb. It is incredulous that anyone would name their data mining company after a tool that promises foresight but ultimately leads to ruin....”  - Deborah azharra 

Peter thiel is an anagram for “the reptile” and when you say that name out loud it sounds eerily similar to the word “ped0phile”. It’s a play on word. These people operate via hidden in plain sight symbolism.  
Anyways, to counteract their plans means we need to develop higher levels of awareness (embodying higher levels of consciousness means we will naturally know what to do and how to not fall into the darks plans) we need to heal ourselves, eachother and eventually ditching their technology so they can’t use it to spy on us (also resist and don’t use any future technology they release). We need to unite, return to our spiritual roots and return to living to living in harmony with the earth in the right way.

conspiracy,consciousanchoress,1760145420.0,This Little Piggy,"“Why are they pushing peanut butter so hard right now?” A question I asked myself today, as I learned Chicago-style egg rolls have peanut butter in them online. Followed by a separate media platform featuring the recipe for peanut butter-maple syrup for waffles. Then I bought Peanut M&M’s— so it’s working.

What do market and viral food trends say about the geopolitical environment? Or if we push the analysis even further- what does it imply about the future food desert before us? Yes, I meant “desert” not “dessert.”

Since Covid-19, food prices have increased exponentially. Rate of inflation for food rose to 11% in August of 2022, the highest since 1979. It has continued to rise 3% each year. A simpler view: groceries have gone up 29% since the beginning of 2020 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The inflation rate affects different food products more severely. These includes meat, poultry, fish, and eggs having the highest inflation rate, and cereals and grain products with the lowest inflation rate.

Pricing steers the consumer to purchase products that are either a necessity, or substitute staples with more affordable options. As animal products become more expensive, alternatives are brought to market.

For example, the Avian flu H5N1 took out flocks and raised eggs prices. Those who could afford to pay nearly $16 a dozen were in the minority. Over 30% of Americans stopped buying eggs altogether.

Tariffs increase the prices of imported products like bananas and coffee, which have few domestic options as replacements. Price-friendly supplemental proteins, like imported fish and shellfish also rose in cost, as much as 130%. 

For those of us who were once starving college students, I ask you to remember your grocery list. Mine was simple, mostly microwaveable. It included: white cheddar Pasta-Roni, margarine (butter was too expensive), Oriental Flavor Ramen, peanut butter granola bars, mandarin orange fruit cups (to prevent the ever-dreaded scurvy), generic Nutella, and pretzel sticks.

In retrospect, this is a bunker diet. Plant based, mainly dairy-free, does not require refrigeration. More importantly, it is not balanced or nutritious.

The foods that are becoming accessible to the American public, or let’s say the 30% that stopped buying eggs during the Avian Flu, are the affordable foods. The food less affected by inflation are shelf-stable, processed carbohydrates and plant-based proteins like peanut butter. Which apparently, I am stuck on. George Washington Carver, thank you.

Because this is the food climate where I believe we are headed. The diet our guts are being guided toward, those of us who are working class. There are factions who believe we are being introduced into consuming insects, like cricket flour, for nefarious purposes. But I view this plotted, omnivorous map as one leading to a kind of “bunker life.” They are training us for less and less.

Maybe they are preparing us for a lockdown lifestyle again? But a longer quarantine, without the factory farms and ports fully operational. Perhaps our electrical grid is more susceptible to go haywire than we ever knew, and we will need to be prepared to live on non-perishables. 

If the above happens, many of us have been eating more and more poorly since 2022– so maybe our tastebuds will forget the taste of an organic, unctuous avocado quickly. Because hangry people are hard to control.",1o3ip29,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1o3ip29/this_little_piggy/,0

conspiracy,MutedWaves085,1759815492.0,the real meaning about Grimes Tablet,"So,

i have high pattern recognition, and i get so intrigued when i see a pattern no one else talking about. There is a pattern i saw recently, i am still conducting my research and analysis about it, so i want share it just yet but i would like to ask where can i publish my findings ? they would be extensive and i will have data in sheets, pdfs and graphs that proves my conclusion, hence i am asking.

anyway, i was searching in this sub to see if anyone else had talked about the pattern i am analyzing, and i came across this picture, many people have made several interpertations to it over the years. I think i have the jackpot for you on this.

first, here is the full message in the picture :

row 1 : 😓😓.😈🔥👶🤖...➕   
row 2 : 🧚‍♀️💞❗   
row 3 : 🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️❤️🕷️\_.   
row 4 : 💡❗   
row 5 : 💵💵😜.   
row 6 : 🎙️🎤🎧➕i\_0➕🧫🧬🦠➕💉💉💉🟰🛸.   
row 7 : #️⃣🏹🗡️⛏️⚔️🛡️🔪⛓️🚬❗.....   
row 8 : 😖.😧❗❓..🤮..😛🥰.   
row 9 : 🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔❗❗❗❗❗❗❗   
row 10 : 🐉🌸🐉.   
row 11 : 💘.   
row 12 : ⚛️☢️☣️.❗.🔚

here is the meaning:   
  
row 1: oh no, the devil has created AI and it is multiplying  
  
row 2 : they try to deceive us by telling us AI is good  
  
row 3 : now we are trapped in this cherade   
*Note: (but i can't figure why those many numbers of emojis, numbers 7 hearts and 8 spiders ? why? what the number mean?)*

row 4 : they have an idea

row 5 : it will make them wealthy in a cunning way   
*Note: (pandemic made pharma and tech companies super wealthy)*

row 6 : lets spread propagnda and fear of a disease then they will create a virus and force us to take a vaccine 3 shots and this all is an alien's idea  
*Note: (i can't figure out why i\_o? what does that mean? if they wanted I/O they will put / but they put \_)* 

row 7 : there will be major attack that will chain many attacks, it will be the talk of social media and people will be chill about it which are Russia & Ukraine, Israel (and sometimes US gets involoved) Vs. Yemen, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Qatar and Iran, India & Pakistan, Cambodia & Thailand, US & Venzuela, Russia & Poland, Estonia, Romania. (UK, France and other countries are preparing for war)  
*Note: (but i can't understand why exactly those emojis, the letter could just chose war emojis? so why those specifc ones? )*

row 8 : After continuous chill because they thought the attacks will stop, people will be shocked that attacks didn't stop and they will question it and be disgusted by the answers .. they will reach an agreement at the end   
*Note:(ongoing two state solution?)*

row 9 : Eclipses will intensify during this time and this above conflicts will continue for a long time.  
*Note: I don't know if its just me, but eclipses really gained some viral attention these few years, especially the latest blood moon. literally everyone was talking about it. but also this pattern of emojis can represent continuity, very plausible.*

row 10 : Taiwan and possibly HK are in the middle of chinese clutches

row 11 : Chinea finally takes over one or both of them fully and with acceptance from those two nations. tough love

row 12 : this will lead to a nuclear war   
*Note: (it can also signifies the Israel and US attack on Iran. in which the plan has failed. i will explain further below)*

  
Further insights:   
Actually this year is seeing more numbers of conflicts on a global scale that literally pops out of nowhere and they are very close to each other in proxmity of time and sometimes locations which tells me that many of those conflicts were plan b, c, d .. and it continues. 

some conflicts were avoided, did you know they tried to create a conflict between Thailand and Malaysia this year? those two countries' borders has always seen tension due to some separatists that want to seperate from Thailand into Malaysia. Anyway, this year 2 news got viral just after cooldown of Cambodia Vs. Thailand conflict. the two news were:  
1- Two Malaysian citizens were set on fire in Bangkok   
2- A Malaysian man was caught in Thailand with numbers of firearms including AK guns in his car (i saw the pictures of the bust, the man obviously wanted to be caught)   
  
I strongly believe someone is trying to ignite a WW3 with nuclear involved. I honestly thought that Israel-Iran conflict will polarize the world and we will get into a nuclear WW3, but they managed to avoid that. 

Also to add to the above, i tried to have AIs decipher those emojis for me without telling them anything about a theory or anything, i just asked them to tell me what they thing those emojies mean,   
  
ChatGPT kept going on loops of questions non ending (do you want me to do this, how about this, i will do it shortly, do you want me to do this ...etc)  
Microsoft Copilot entered a thinking mode for over an hour now and never got out of it.   
Gemini, well it just straight forward lied as it always does and acted cool about it.

DeepSeek is the only one got a bit far with me and then it realized that hmm i can't engage with him about this, abort abort abort hahahaha .. i attached the DeepSeek response after i tried to push back, i like this AI it is very honest. 

why am i pointing out this, because i engaged with AIs about other theories and they just went along just fine with it. this one red tape around it. 

thanks for reading, hope this was intriguing to you as it was to me.",1o06eha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o06eha,13

conspiracy,Expensive-Shirt-6877,1759782460.0,Looking back objectively: Why was the Vaccine pushed so hard? Discussion,"Hi everyone, now that it is roughly 4 years after Covid and the big mandates/ vaccine push, I was hoping we could have a retrospective discussion on the real reason the MRNA Vaccine's were pushed so incredibly hard. Young people took it, people gave it to their kids, 22 year olds in the best shape of their life were forced to take it in the military. The official story to me makes Zero sense.

**My question is why? Here are some possible options I can think of**

1) Was it just a big money grab? A coordinated push to lock in multi Billion-dollar pharma revenues?

2) Was it even more sinister, and was it an intentional bioweapon to harm people as [Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJiFkABzYtK/) believes. And the mrna is altering your brain, heart, & even personality.

3) Was it a big test in fear and obedience? See who will comply and who will resist?

4) Was it a setup for Digital ID's? Maybe designed to normalize mandates, and set precedents for digital passes and broad public health powers?

5) Or was it less sinister. Maybe it was meant to be a legitimate vaccine and lessen Covid, but the new MRNA technology had slightly more side effects then they were expecting and they had free testing on billions of people.

  
I am not sure myself. The video of Bill DeBlasio [offering fries seriously gives me the creeps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSrklAa0qp0) I think it was a combo between 3 & 4. Imo the side effects were bad, but not bad enough to warrant #2. Unless it was on a 5-7 year timeline and we have yet to see the worst of the side effects. 

  
[This new documentary on MRNA is pretty interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZrJraN2nOQ&t=529s)

  
Anyways, I'd love to hear peoples thoughts! Let's limit this to exactly why the Vaccine was pushed so unbelievably hard.

measles,IIWIIM8,1553007013.0,"Measles - Chad, Africa",">**EVENT DESCRIPTION**
>
>The measles outbreak in Chad continues, with more incidence cases
occurring and new districts being affected. The disease trend has
continued to increase since the beginning of the year. Since our last report
on 24 February 2019, **2,726 additional suspected measles cases with 14
deaths** have been reported. In week 10 (week ending 10 March 2019),
a total of 924 suspected measles cases have been reported, compared
to 948 suspected cases reported in week 9. Seven new districts attained
suspected measles epidemic level during the reporting week.
Between 1 January and 15 March 2019, a total of 5 810 suspected
measles cases, including 28 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.5%) have been
reported. Ninety-eight out of 117 (84%) districts in the country have
been affected, of which 69 have attained suspected measles epidemic
threshold. Twenty-one districts have constantly remained in suspected
epidemic state since the beginning of 2019. Amtiman District remains the
most affected, reporting 1 399 suspected cases and seven deaths. Other
highly affected districts are N’Djamena East (463 cases), N’Djamena
Center (373 cases, 2 deaths), Dourbali (345 cases), Abéché (332 cases,
2 deaths) and N’Djamena South (244 cases).
>
>Of 1,045 suspected cases investigated during the reporting week, 83%
reportedly received no measles antigen-containing vaccines. About 60%
of the cases were below five years of age, 18% were between five and
nine years and 13% were 15 years and above, with the overall average
age being six years.

>**SITUATION INTERPRETATION**
>
>The measles outbreak in Chad continues, with increasing case incidence and wider
geographical span since the beginning of 2019. The response to this outbreak continues
to experience shortfall in resources, including testing reagents, vaccines and operational
funds. Systematic laboratory testing of specimens has not been conducted since the
beginning of 2019, affecting proper description and characterization of the outbreak.
Vaccination campaigns have also been patchy, with only one-half of the affected districts
covered. **Recent investigation showed that more than 83% of the new cases have not
been vaccinated, an indication of continuous low coverage of routine and supplementary
immunization services.** There is a need to step up the ongoing response to this outbreak,
especially immunization services, in order to quickly contain the outbreak. Mobilization of
resources for the implementation of the response plan in all affected areas is of paramount
importance.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that occurred in the respiratory system. It caused by a virus that called Rubeola Virus. It spread by contact person to person. An infected person can spread it to the air by coughing or sneeze.

Common Causes

It caused by infection with the Rubeola virus. The virus lives in the mucus in the nose and throat of an infected child or adult. The infected person is spreading for 4 days before the disease appears and continues so for about 4-5 days afterward.



Measles 
Measles


It can spread by:

**Physical contact with an infected person.
**Being nearby infected people if they cough or sneeze.
**Touching a surface that has infected droplets of mucus ""the virus remains active for 2 hours"" and then putting fingers into the mouth, or rubbing the nose or eyes.

Symptoms

Symptoms may include:

**Rash 3 to 4 days after initial symptoms, a reddish-brown spotty rash appears.
**Coryza a runny nose.
**Dry hacking cough.
**Conjunctivitis swollen eyelids, inflamed eyes.
**Watery eyes.
**Photophobia sensitivity to light.
**Sneezing.
**Fever this may be mild to severe and can reach 40.8 degrees Centigrade for a number of days. Fever may drop and then rise again when the rash appears.
**Koplik's spots - very small grayish-white spots with bluish-white centers in the mouth, insides of cheeks, and throat.
**Generalized body aches.

Common Ways to Treat it

**Vitamin A supplements studies have shown that vitamin A supplements significantly help prevent complications caused by measles.
**Dehydration make sure the child is hydrated. If the child has a fever, they can become dehydrated more quickly.
**Fever if the temperature is high, the child should be kept cool, but not too cold. Check with a doctor about acetaminophen dosage, too much can harm the child, especially the liver.
**Isolation during the contagious stage, infected children should be kept away from school and should not return to activities that involve human interaction.
**Smoking do not smoke near the child.
**Photophobia as the child may be sensitive to light, keeping the lights dim or the room darkened may help. Sunglasses may also help.
**Conjunctivitis if there is crustiness around the eyes, gently clean with a warm, damp cloth.
**Cough cough medicines will not relieve a cough. Humidifiers or placing a bowl of water in the room may help.",64i2ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Measles/comments/64i2ab/measles_a_highly_contagious_disease/,1

measles,LeahDurant,1421794577.0,"Visitors Leave Disneyland with Measles, not Memories","A recent trip to Disneyland has left dozens of visitors with measles rather than memories.

At least 26 people who visited the theme park in Orange County, California, between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20 have contracted the disease. State officials have confirmed that the outbreak is the worst in 15 years. Already, the disease has spread to Utah, Colorado, and Washington State. Six individuals have been hospitalized.

“Disneyland — this is the ideal scenario. This is sort of the perfect storm,” said Dr. James Cherry, an expert on pediatric infectious diseases who works at the University of California, Los Angeles.

This current outbreak comes at the tail end of last year’s surge in measles cases. At least 644 people came down with measles in the United States in 2014, up from 189 in 2013 — an increase of more than 340 percent.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads when a person coughs, sneezes, or even breathes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to 2 hours after that person is gone.”

Symptoms of the measles begins with a high fever, then continue with coughing, red eyes, and finally a rash that spreads across a person’s entire body.

The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective for most people and can help prevent measles. No vaccine, however, is 100 percent effective. Indeed, multiple players in the National Hockey League have come down with mumps this year, despite having received the MMR vaccine.

Although vaccines have proven effective in combating the spread of disease, for some, administration of a shot can result in rare but serious side effects or injuries.

One such injury is Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). This injury leads to severe damage in the tendons and ligaments of a person’s shoulder. Symptoms vary but can include limited range of motion, frozen shoulder, and general tenderness. Sometimes surgery is necessary to correct the damage.

SIRVA can occur if a health administrator injects a vaccine too high on a person’s shoulder or at the wrong angle. If a person is underweight or has a low body mass, SIRVA can also result from the needle over penetrating the deltoid muscle.

A recent study published in the medical journal Pediatrics found that the MMR vaccine can sometimes lead to seizures.

Fortunately, there is help for anyone who suffers a negative reaction to a vaccine.

The federal government created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1988. The VICP helps folks suffering from serious side effects obtain compensation for their injuries. Last year, the average reward was over $500,000.

The VICP covers a variety of vaccines. For the most up-to-date list, check out the vaccine injury compensation table on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services‘ website.

As news of Disneyland’s measles outbreak spreads, some parents may consider getting an MMR vaccine for their children. They’re unlikely to suffer any side effects. But if they do, it’s important to remember that the VICP can help.

30M 

I have taken the standard ones like annual covid, flu shots. Hep b, dtap, etc.

So pretty much the essential ones i have taken already but my company can reimburse a few hundred dollars which is enough for 1-2 vaccines I think.

What would you guys recommend? I have 1 shot hpv done at 29 and I believe if you are low risk population that should be enough? Personally i want to avoid that as that vaccine is painful and felt like getting whipped.

I am considering maybe hep A (but that requires 2 doses and i only have time for first dose as i am leaving my job), pcv 20 + ppsv 23 (however, pcv21 is not available here and I read that pcv21 coverage is a lot better).

vaccines,okcarpincho,1759694889.0,"Mucosal vaccines: innate and adaptative response, is it like this?","Are these steps correct? When are Brm and Trms generated? 

1. Antigen Entry

The pathogen or antigen can enter the mucosa through different mechanisms:
A) Epithelial passage:
	•	Paracellular: between the tight junctions of epithelial cells.
	•	Transcellular: passing through the epithelial cells themselves.

B) M cells (FAE – follicle-associated epithelium):
	•	Transport the antigen from the lumen to dendritic cells (DCs) waiting in the lamina propria.

C) “Sampling” dendritic cells:
	•	Extend protrusions through epithelial junctions and directly sample the lumen to capture antigens.

D) Goblet cells:
	•	Can transfer soluble antigens from the lumen to underlying DCs.

⸻

2. Capture and Presentation by APCs or DCs beneath the FAE (in the inductive site, e.g., NALT)
	•	Dendritic cells (DCs) capture antigens that have crossed the epithelium.
	•	They process the antigen and present it on MHC I or II, as appropriate.
	•	They migrate to organized T and B lymphocyte zones.
	•	There they initiate the activation of naïve T lymphocytes and communicate with B lymphocytes.

Innate activation through PRRs:
DCs and epithelial cells recognize antigens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs, NOD-like, and RIG-I-like receptors.
This promotes:
	•	DC maturation.
	•	Release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6).
	•	Recruitment of additional antigen-presenting cells and activation of the microenvironment for the adaptive response.

⸻

3. T Lymphocyte Activation
	•	DCs present antigen via MHC to naïve T lymphocytes.
	•	CD4⁺ T cells differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg subsets depending on the cytokine environment.
	•	Tfh (follicular helper T cells) are key for assisting B cells.
	•	CD8⁺ T cells are activated as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to eliminate infected cells.

⸻

4. B Lymphocyte Activation and Germinal Center Formation
	•	B lymphocytes receive help from Tfh cells and cytokine signals.
	•	They become activated and form germinal centers in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
There, the following occur:
	•	Isotype switching, predominantly toward IgA.
	•	Affinity maturation.

Activated T and B cells coordinate the local adaptive response: production of secretory IgA (S-IgA) and antimicrobial peptides (defensins).
Plasmablasts and plasma cells in the mucosa are responsible for multimerizing IgA and secreting it into the lumen.

⸻

5. Egress to Circulation (Exit of Activated Cells)
	•	Activated T and B lymphocytes in the inductive site (NALT, BALT, GALT, etc.) modify the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors.
	•	This allows them to leave the lymphoid tissue via lymphatic vessels → reach lymph nodes → then enter the bloodstream.

⸻

6. Homing to Mucosal Sites (Differential Trafficking to Effector Sites)
	•	Once in circulation, “mucosa-educated” lymphocytes express integrins and chemokine receptors that guide their return to other mucosal effector sites.
	•	Example in the respiratory tract: α4β1–VCAM-1 and CCR10 direct cells to respiratory tissues.
	•	This phenomenon of mucosal compartmentalization allows cells activated in NALT to migrate not only to the nasal mucosa, but also to bronchial mucosa, salivary glands, and mammary glands.

⸻

7. Response at the Effector Site
	•	Plasma cells secrete dimeric IgA, which is transported across the epithelium by the pIgR receptor and released into the lumen as secretory IgA (S-IgA).
	•	There is also some contribution from transudated IgG and resident T cells (TRM) that remain in the mucosa for rapid response.
	•	Final outcome: local neutralization of pathogens on the mucosal surface, preventing colonization and infection.

Additionally:
	•	Resident memory T cells (Trm), especially CD8⁺ (cytotoxic) and CD4⁺ (helper), remain in the mucosa to provide an immediate response upon re-exposure.
	•	Resident memory B cells (Brm) are generated and rapidly differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma cells upon antigen re-encounter.

I just wanted to share my experience with the Covid vaccine that I just got the other day in case this information helps anyone. I know everyone is different so this may not be what you will experience. My significant other seems to shrug all vaccines off with no issues.  But not me :-(

I’m almost 60 but I live in a state that is not requiring me to be 65 to get the vaccine. I did not have to choose any medical reason for wanting to get my vaccine even though supposedly I am “underage”.  I am traveling in the next month and wanted to be somewhat protected. My sibling caught COVID last month right when she started her vacation and she basically spent her entire vacation extremely sick and in bed. She had diarrhea, nausea, high fever, extreme fatigue, a bad cough and nasal congestion. She couldn’t eat for days. She was sick upwards of 4 weeks with the first 2 weeks being in misery. Not wanting to be in a similar situation, I decided to get the vaccine. I know this will not prevent getting the virus but possibly reducing the severity. BTW, she did not get a vaccine last year. 

So I got my vaccine around 12:00 noon. After I had lunch I took one 500mg acetaminophen . I felt fine the remainder of the day. I did some light exercise around the house. My arm was a little sore about 2 hours after the vaccine and I felt achy in my shoulders by late evening. I took another acetaminophen and went to bed around 10:30PM. I woke up around 2:00AM feeling a little hot and achy in my muscles.  I slept fitfully for the remainder of the night. 

When I woke up (this is about 18 hours after the vaccine), I felt extremely tired and had a slight headache. I took another 500 mg acetaminophen and took a nap after breakfast. Normally I go for a 45 minute to 1 hour walk, but I felt too tired to do this.  After lunch I took another longer nap, about 1 1/2 hours. I felt much better after this nap. By this time it had been roughly 28 hours after the vaccine. I felt good enough to take a 45 minute slower walk than usual around my neighborhood. The headache receded around the 30 hour mark. I took a shower, ate a light dinner and went to bed early, around  9:45PM. I slept well. 

When I woke up the next morning, I felt completely normal again except for slight arm pain at the injection site.  I was able to do all my activities including my walk and a light exercise routine. 

That’s it. It wasn’t bad at all but I would say from the 14 hour mark to roughly 28-30 hour mark, you might not feel too well.  You might want to take a low dosage pain killer to manage the pain if needed. Maybe take the day off after the vaccine if you can or at least 1/2 day. 

Anyways, hope this helps someone out there. ",1nrj97u,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1nrj97u/covid_vaccine_side_effects_timeline/,22

vaccines,Watchhistory,1758639341.0,New York Democrats are pushing state legislative fixes to ensure continued access to vaccines,"New York Democrats are pushing state legislative fixes to ensure continued access to vaccines as public health experts raise concerns about a shift away from scientific rigor in federal immunization guidelines.

Assembly Health Committee Chair Amy Paulin has introduced [a bill](https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09060&term=2025&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y) that would allow pharmacies and clinicians to administer shots based on state and regional recommendations, in addition to federal guidance — and require insurers to cover vaccines based on those recommendations.

“We just have to be sure that everyone has access \[to vaccines\] and everyone has coverage and that doctors and nurse practitioners and all other prescribers have an ability to keep everyone safe from harm,” Paulin said.

State Sen. Michelle Hinchey also introduced a version of the bill in her chamber.

The proposed legislation would allow New York doctors and pharmacists to order and administer shots based on recommendations from two existing state groups — the [Immunization Advisory Council](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/imm_advisory_council/#meetings) and the 21st Century Workgroup for Disease Elimination and Reduction — in addition to the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.

It would also allow them to administer vaccines based on guidance from an “interstate body” such as the newly established [Northeast Public Health Collaborative](https://gothamist.com/news/ny-joins-new-regional-public-health-collaborative-as-antidote-to-federal-vaccine-turmoil).

The legislation would also amend state insurance law to require health plans to cover all vaccines recommended by these groups, rather than only requiring them to cover shots recommended by ACIP.

Other bills pending in the state Legislature also aim to address the uncertainty around federal vaccine guidance. Legislation introduced by Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Micah Lasher this past spring [would allow](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/09/11/lawmakers-working-on-bill-to-expand-n-y--health-dept--vaccine-authority) pharmacists to administer shots as long as they were recommended by the state health commissioner.

Lawmakers won’t be able to pass any legislation around vaccine guidelines until they return to Albany in January.

New York law has long deferred to ACIP on vaccine standards. But the committee was recently overhauled by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and now counts vaccine critics among its members.

At [public meetings](https://gothamist.com/news/what-to-know-about-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-in-ny-ahead-of-new-federal-guidelines) on Thursday and Friday, the committee voted to restrict access to a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and to require all patients to have conversations with clinicians about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination before getting a shot. The committee narrowly voted against requiring a prescription for COVID shots.

The committee did not recommend restricting vaccine access as much as some observers expected. But the meetings, nonetheless, raised concerns among public health experts, including former CDC officials, that federal vaccine recommendations are now being driven by ideology rather than science.

“We saw science sidelined, conspiracy theorists elevating unproven and often discredited science onto the previously credible ACIP platform and resolutions that had not gone through the standard scientific rigor,” Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned from his position as director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a press call Monday.

Daskalakis joined the CDC after serving in the New York City health department.

David Jakubowicz, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, said he supported state legislation that prioritized state or regional guidance until faith in federal recommendations could be restored.

“Given the upheaval that's going on, given the way that things have been handled, unfortunately it's caused a fair amount of distrust,” Jakubowicz said.

He said his top concern was making sure vaccines remained available and covered by insurance.

Gov. Kathy Hochul took steps this month to try to alleviate confusion in the medical community and ensure widespread access to the latest COVID shots after the ACIP guidance was delayed and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration only recommended the shots for those over 65 or with certain health conditions.

But the [executive order](https://gothamist.com/news/hochul-to-let-pharmacists-prescribe-covid-vaccines-amid-federal-policy-shift) Hochul issued on Sept. 5 allowing pharmacies to broadly administer COVID shots still needs to be renewed on a monthly basis and doesn’t address other types of vaccines that could be restricted in the future or create an insurance mandate.

Hochul previously said she anticipated renewing the Sept. 5 executive order until the Legislature could take action. She did not comment Monday on specific legislative proposals",1nojlfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1nojlfj/new_york_democrats_are_pushing_state_legislative/,11

>The panel also said that everyone from 6 months to 64 years old could get the vaccine after consulting with a provider.

Im so relieved! thank you everyone who replied and gave advice encouragement! BTW I didnt even need to give her the prescription!



Hello, I went today to ask for a prescription for a COVID vax and scheduled an appnt with cvs for right after. My doctor reluctantly gave me one but she asked me if i could postpone my vax appt until next week bc she really didnt think I  should get one. She told me Im 52 and healthy (although I have anxiety and depression) and that I really dont need one, and that now the illness is not as bad as before for most healthy people. She asked me how many Ive had, I said Ive about 4 of the Pfizer(not including the 1st two initial doses) and that I havent had one since Jan 2024. She talked to her husband who is also a doctor at the practice and he said that he thinks Ive taken too many vax shots already and that so many for someone like me can actually be harmful.

I dont know, Im very confused and upset about all this, I really was eager to get my vax today and beat any decision by RFK to get rid of access to them,  but now I had to cancel the appointment out of respect for her bc she's been my doctor for about 20 years. But this is a very red area(Miami Fl ) Im worried that maybe they've ""drunk the koolaid"" regarding anti vax rhetoric despite being doctors. I told her I plan to send her links to info about how COVID is still a problem, there are still waves of it rising and how repeated exposure to infections is bad even for younger people bc it can make you more susceptible to long term effects (like Long Covid) and health complications later on in life. Does anyone know of good links to reputable articles about this that I can show her?

vaccines,SmallLumpOGreenPutty,1757800730.0,Side effects of whooping cough vax,"Hi, I'm from the UK. I had the whooping cough vaccine last Thursday as part of pregnancy procedures and was told in person that the area may feel firm/lumpy and may ache. Online it says that redness or swelling can occur. As of this evening i have slight swelling, firmness, and redness. But since this morning I'm having another reaction i wasn't expecting.

I'm wondering how common it can be for the injection site to become hotter, as i measured the temp at the site compared to another area on the same bicep and there was a 3°C difference - 36.2 compared to 33. There's some bruising immediately around where the needle went in and it's also been itching this evening. I've looked online and found nothing which mentions a temp increase as a side effect.

Is the itching and raised temperature a potential side effect? I will phone the doctor on Monday if it continues until then - i just thought I'd ask here in the meantime.",1ng9yty,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1ng9yty/side_effects_of_whooping_cough_vax/,2

vaccines,JuliaX1984,1756948693.0,"Despite the press releases, I got my 2025-26 covid and flu shots in Pittsburgh, PA, USA today with no obstacles or extra hoops.","By now, I'm sure everyone's familiar with the list of 16 states where CVS and Walgreens allegedly aren't offering covid shots or would have extra hoops to jump through to get them. So, as a resident of PA, and an adult non-driver, who hates getting sick and is the primary caregiver for 2 immunocompromised adults, I've been planning to cross the border into Ohio or Maryland this weekend to get one, since CVS' website showed they have the updated covid vaccine in stock there.

I've been comparing the pros and cons of taking the Greyhound to Youngstown, the train to Cumberland, or of asking my sister if she wants to take a road trip to Steubenville, and constantly checking CVS' website to see what appointments are still available. Now CVS' website starts by showing the pharmacies nearest your location, then you have to change the zip code if you want to. And so far, that first auto ""pharmacies nearest you"" results page has always said no covid shots are available near me. That's what it said this morning before 9 am. Then this afternoon, it suddenly said one near me actually had it!

I booked an appointment after work and went. Checked in at the kiosk. CRNP called me back into the Minute Clinic room. Asked to see my ID and insurance (United Healthcare, through my job). She said she had to tell me there were risks and side effects. I told her to just do what she had to do and check the box. I also volunteered that I have a high BMI, which is technically true AND listed as a high-risk factor, but she didn't comment on it. I did not need to provide proof of any condition that makes me more susceptible. No doctor's note needed. Went the same way a pharmacy vaccine always does. Even got my flu shot, too.

After all the horror the CDC has been putting us through, this seemed too good to be true, so I actually asked if they were REALLY the updated versions. Bless her heart, she actually showed me the boxes to prove, yes, they were the 2025-26 versions. Miss, if you're reading this, I'm sorry and deeply appreciate it!

I now hypothesize that the CDC is just fearmongering about vaccine availability. Maybe they don't have the authority to ban it outright in all states, so they're just convincing people it won't be available so they don't bother to look for it.

So keep checking, keep asking, cross borders if you have to, but don't assume the CDC has successfully blocked it. And don't trust the papers.

Will every pharmacist or tech be this rational and helpful? No. Could things change next week? Absolutely. I just want everyone to know, there is hope, and the papers were wrong about this one point, at least.

P.S. Since I left the pharmacy, a second location in my area is now offering appointments!

NEXT DAY UPDATE: I actually thought to test the CVS website this morning. When I booked my appt, I just checked Yes for the susceptibility question to see if it would let me or if it would ask for details and proof and a prescription, but it didn't, so I just kept going.

This morning, I tried booking a covid vaccine in a PA zip code but checked No to the vulnerability question. And it gave me a message saying, sorry, you're not eligible.

But they didn't ask for proof or details or a prescription or anything at the appt. Which means there's nothing the employee needs to enter or fill in for their paperwork. CVS is not tracking what conditions people have or documenting proof to cover their ass from some CDC action.

So you have to click Yes, but it's pointless because you don't need proof.",1n7wul5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1n7wul5/despite_the_press_releases_i_got_my_202526_covid/,21

vaccines,Stephan11111,1756753197.0,Losing Varicella Titer after few months,"Hey all,

37M with autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. Long post ahead (see Tldr below)

Last year my neurologist wanted me to take a higher efficiency disease modifying drug (subclinical disease activity), which required lots of vaccinations. These drugs are immunosuppressants (targeting mostly B cell - sometimes kill them completely and some target also some T cells).

So, I stopped my current medication, wait the needed time and after all other vaccines, get 2 doses of Varilix (~4 weeks apart). 
I had no titer and my mom did not recall I ever got chickenpox as a child (however, my older  brother did and I was already alive).

So, after 6 weeks I had a very good measureable varicella titer.
Some time elapsed (due to other reasons) and I went to a specialized MS hospital and they retested varicella titer. After ~ 6 months it was way below immunity status, basically gone. The test was redone a second time and I also paid for one in another lab. The result was always, no immunity.

Why is this important for me:?

- Neurologist do not want me on high efficiency drug for MS because these are so immunosuppressant that a potential infection could kill me

- Since varicella is a live vaccine and I have MS, it is risky business vaccinate again and again. Live vaccines and MS do not go well with each other because it can cause the MS to get worse.

- Neurologists concluded I am a non responder to varicella and it's vaccine. I should stick to the lower tier medications for MS, which are generally older ones. Modern approaches are then off limit for me.

What would you do? Try revaccination (although there are risks)? Check with an immunologist? Just stick to lower efficiency MS meds?
I found lots of stories about ""non responders"" but none directly losing Titer after such short time.

Tldr: 37m with MS. After getting 2 doses of varicella vaccines lost titer in under 6 months completly. No titer limits severely my MS medication choices. Revaccination is risky with MS.",1n5xh47,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1n5xh47/losing_varicella_titer_after_few_months/,2

Hi all, I hope this is an ok thing to post here, I'm looking for some reassurance that everything is going to be okay and it relates to vaccines. (Sorry if I'm in the wrong place.) Logic and facts say things will be ok but the mom guilt is hitting hard.

I'm 10wks pregnant with my second kiddo, my first is 3 years old and amazing. Before I got pregnant with her I got my vaccines updated, tdap and MMR back in 2021. 

Got the call from my ob today that apparently the rubella part of my MMR didn't stick and I don't have immunity. Catching that while pregnant can be absolutely catastrophic (miscarriage, stillbirth, deafness, birth defects galore) and you can't vaccinate while pregnant. Passing it to baby results in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with those defects, learning disabilities, etc 

There are only like 10 cases annually in the US (where I'm at) of rubella and 5 cases of infants diagnosed with CRS annually. So I KNOW by logic the odds of me catching it are so super low, but I feel so guilty and scared still. and what if the incident rates are only so low because most other pregnant people have immunity; am I going to be the mother of one of those 5 kids?

Due to my severe health anxiety i still went and received the RabAvert Vaccine including the RIG KamRAB day 0. The RIG was injected around my face (due to the location of the scratch) and throughout my body. I have currently taken days 0, 3, and 7 and I only have a few days left from my last dose on day 14.

In terms of side effects, the only current side effect i have been facing since a week into this vaccine schedule is constant shortness of breath and a tight feeling in my throat. I'm constantly having to inhale through my mouth to get a full Inhale. Breathing through my nose isn't satisfactory for me. Ive also felt my throat being constantly inflamed and having mucus constantly at the back. I've already seen the doctors and nurses, and after examining my throat and doing a swab test for anything bacterial, it came back negative and they have said there is no allergic reaction that i am facing and no swelling that they can see.

My most recent visit with my GP, he told me that these symptoms could be from the vaccine, although they will subside on their own. My most distressing and constant new symptom is the shortness of breath and the mouth breathing I'm having to do to get a full breath in. It gets also worse after eating. I'm dreading to take the last shot this upcoming weekend but i was just curious to know if anyone here who has taken the vaccine had experienced anything like me? and if they did how long did it last?

Ped said it might not be covered by insurance and may cost us $200 out of pocket, which is fine. 

Baby is very healthy and happy, no medical complexities at this time. I just am looking for others experience and input. Thanks in advance 

Update: we decided to get MMR at 6 months. Baby tolerated It great, didn’t really have any side effects besides low grade fever. I have a huge weight lifted off my shoulders knowing he has protection! ",1mguvvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1mguvvd/mmr_at_6_months/,12

I'm 4 days into the vaccine and have already taken 2 doses. The first which was a mixture of the RIG and the vaccine, and the second being just the vaccine. I still have 2 more doses left. In terms of symptoms the only thing's i have been experiencing is a constant need to clear my throat and the feeling of mucus being stuck at the back of my throat when swallowing. In general my throat also feels more tight. My GP did notice after examining the back of my throat that it is a bit inflamed and red but no signs of an allergic reaction or closed up throat, even though it feels as if it is.  I have also talked to a nurse about this and they have said if it was any type of allergic reaction i was experiencing that i would have seen some type of extreme reaction the first day. I'm just wondering if anyone who has taken the vaccine ever did have any throat issues like myself? Or is this something completely not related? I was given the Rabavert vaccine.

I told my parents and I went to the hospital and recieved shots that night. Ive read just recently online that you need a vaccine distribution in the arm muscle for adults and older kids and to go back a few times for a series of vaccines.
However, this is peculiar to me because I am 21 now and at the time I received 6 injections around the bite location on my finger.

I went to a local clinic in Myanmar, and the doctor there told me I need to restart the full 5-dose vaccine series again, even after I explained my full vaccine history.

But I have read that:

WHO and CDC say people who already had a full series do not need to restart the full series after exposure.

Only 2 booster doses (Day 0 and Day 3) are needed after re-exposure — even years later.

My booster on May 2, 2024 is still very recent (just 1year and 2 months ago), so I should already be protected.


I’m very poor and rabies vaccines are expensive in Myanmar. I want to understand:

1. Is the full vaccine series really needed again in my case?


2. How long does a rabies booster protect someone?


3. Is it too late to get vaccinated now (Day 3-4)?


4. Am I still protected from my May booster?



Thank you. I have already read the WHO FAQ and I’m trying to do the right thing.

vaccines,electricalkitten,1751357146.0,Shingrix vaccination - reasons why to repeat a schedule after 11 years,"Hi,
 
Background: Shingrix is a two-dose vaccine for shingles, and while it's designed for long-lasting protection, no booster dose is currently recommended for the general population, according to the CDC. The protection from Shingrix is expected to last for at least four years, and potentially longer. A follow-up study showed 79.7% vaccine efficacy in adults aged 50 and older from years 6-11 after vaccination ( From google with no citation )  
 
If a  vaccine is meant to last around 11 years, then a 60 year old could be covered until around  71 years years old. Many people live longer. Shingrix is available for patients up to 80 years   ( source:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals/shingles-immunisation-programme-information-for-healthcare-practitioners )  


 
Q1: If we exclude the a cost benefit study [CBA], then what reasons are there not to repeat a 2 shot schedule after 11 years for a very healthy 79 year old patient?  
Q2: What reasons are there for an 80 year old cut off point for Shingrex? What studies were there?",1low0h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1low0h9/shingrix_vaccination_reasons_why_to_repeat_a/,9

vaccines,Such_Asparagus2975,1750331292.0,Hepatitis vaccine - arm/shoulder issues since.,"I had my third hepatitis vaccine 4 days ago. The first 2 I had the normal sore arm when you lay on it, like any vaccine. This one she put in much higher, less than an inch under my shoulder tip, which I noticed when she put a cotton bud on it and it gave my tshirt the look of a shoulder pad as it was sat right on the arm seam. 

The first evening was the normal sore arm. I woke up the next day with quite intense shoulder pain radiating to my elbow. Wasnt that concerned. Day 3 this got significantly worse, the site itself looks fine i dont tend to react to vaccines, it's a tiny puncture mark and thats it. The pain was in the back of my shoulder and down my arm but worst just above my elbow which is nowhere near the injection site. I have limited ROM, arms in front of me and raising is okay (hurts but I can lift my arm) but raising to the side or behind me i can barely lift my arm at all, certainly no more than 45 degrees from my body. I can't do my bra up, take off a t-shirt or reach to the side of me. I can't drive safely as I can't reach to change gears or grip the steering wheel without pretty intense pain.

Today day 4 I have developed bruising, bizarrely not at the site but around my elbow, starting about 2 inches above it (back of my arm) and into the back of the forearm. The pain is worse, and has gotten worse each day, now radiating from my shoulder into the side of my neck, and into my forearm.

Is this normal? Ive had vaccines yearly (NHS worker) and never had this before. If not should I get it checked out at some point or will it just naturally get better with time? 

Not sure it's relevant but I used to be pretty overweight and have lost 6 stone since my last vaccines, wondering if the much slimmer arm means worse pain?

I've had my first garsadil 9 vaccination and am due my second now with it being six months later (I'm 28 and male, which means I'm on the two dose protocol). 

I can now go in and have I whenever I want within the next six months, so want to get it as soon as possible. The only thing is, I have also since discovered that I have some sleep problems, and possibly undiagnosed sleep apnea (I have to have a sleep study ect which could take months). I may not have sleep apnea and its highly unlikely to be severe, but I do sometimes have bad sleep and I have been told I have a small airway.

I read that with many vaccinations, poor sleep prior to having the vaccine and after can significantly lessen the antibody response. I've become quite stressed about that, and its getting to the point that I've put back the date a few times to try sleep better for it, which just ends up in me being worried about sleeping and then not…it’s not terrible sleep deprivation or anything, but its not ideal.

vaccines,LaraVeliant,1749362163.0,4th rabies vaccine 10 days late,"Hello. On May 16 I ended up in a cave full of bats in Ecuador (not on purpose). I don’t think I got bit but since they were spooked and bouncing off of us everywhere I can’t say for sure, at least not enough to stake my life on it. May 20 when I got back to my country (USA) I received RIG and the first vaccine. May 23 I received second vaccine. May 27, I received 3rd vaccine. Fourth vaccine was due June 3 but since I am out of the country again the ER doctor said to come back after my trip (June 12 or 13) for the final dose. They said they could not administer it 3 days early before I left for this trip. 


For more background info, I was immunized for rabies 25 years ago after being bit by a feral cat. However, on May 20 they still administered RIG to me which I read afterwards could actually dull the body’s immune response in a previously immunized person. I also know that for previously immunized people, the protocol is 2 booster shots instead of 4, however when I discussed this with the provider at my 2nd vac appointment they insisted I should get all 4.


Now onto the problem. Since last night I have been experiencing off and on an itchiness and tingling sensation on my left glute muscle. When I look at it, I see 2 tiny dots of broken skin, but that could be because I scratched it. The country I’m in is cold right now so I’ve been fully clothed the whole time I’ve been here, and there are very few if any bugs right now, so I don’t think it’s an insect bite. I’ve also felt congestion in my throat, like a lump in my throat that makes swallowing feel more difficult, but not painful or impossible, for about 3 days. 


I will admit to having anxiety about the situation, though I’ve never experienced health anxiety like this before. I’m not looking for medical advice, but with the information presented, does it seem like this is cause for concern? Or should I be well protected by this point?

vaccines,girlbosssage,1748864561.0,Being anti-vaccine in 2025 is like refusing clean water during a cholera outbreak.,"I want to talk about vaccines — not from a place of hostility, but out of genuine concern. In 2025, with all the data we have, it's deeply troubling that vaccine hesitancy is still so widespread. I understand that every parent wants to make the best decision for their child. But choosing not to vaccinate is not a harmless personal decision — it's one that carries real risk, not just for your child but for the people around them.

Vaccines are among the most carefully studied and monitored medical interventions in the world. They've saved millions of lives annually and helped either eliminate or drastically reduce the spread of once-devastating diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, and tetanus. These aren’t just historical footnotes — the reason these diseases are rare today is precisely because vaccines have been so widely adopted. When vaccination rates drop, these diseases come back. We’ve already seen resurgences of measles in countries where vaccine coverage declined.

One of the most harmful myths that still circulates is the idea that vaccines cause autism. This claim originated from a now-discredited 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, who was found to have falsified data and had serious ethical violations. He was stripped of his medical license. Since then, dozens of large-scale studies involving millions of children across multiple countries have consistently found no connection between vaccines and autism. This question has been studied more than almost any other in medical science, and the results are unequivocal: there is no link.

I also understand that people worry about side effects. That’s a reasonable instinct — no medical intervention is completely without risk. But the reality is that severe adverse reactions to vaccines are incredibly rare — often less than one in a million doses. Meanwhile, the diseases these vaccines prevent can be deadly or leave children with permanent damage. Choosing not to vaccinate doesn’t mean you’re avoiding risk — it means you’re taking a different, and far more dangerous, risk.

Another argument I often hear is that natural immunity is better. In some cases, it’s true that getting a disease can lead to longer-lasting immunity. But that comes at a cost: the illness itself. Gaining immunity to measles by getting measles is like saying the best way to protect your house from fire is to let it burn down and rebuild it stronger. Vaccines provide immunity without the suffering and danger of the disease. That’s their whole purpose.

And finally, there’s the idea of “delaying” vaccines — waiting until a child is older. But there’s no medical benefit to that approach, and there’s a significant downside: young children are most vulnerable to the very diseases vaccines are designed to prevent. Delaying protection during the period when it’s needed most increases the risk of severe outcomes. Pediatric vaccination schedules are carefully studied and designed to provide the most effective protection at the right time.

This isn’t about “doing your own research” — it’s about recognizing the limits of individual knowledge and respecting the overwhelming scientific consensus that comes from decades of rigorous, peer-reviewed research. Being skeptical is healthy. But skepticism should lead to better questions and deeper understanding — not to denying facts that have been confirmed across generations of data, research, and real-world evidence.

Vaccination is not just about protecting your own child. It’s a commitment to public health — to protecting the most vulnerable people in your community: infants, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised and cannot be vaccinated. Refusing vaccines puts them at risk too.

We all want what’s best for our children. That’s something everyone can agree on. But science isn’t something we can pick and choose from based on what feels right. When it comes to vaccines, the evidence is clear, and the risks of not vaccinating are too great to ignore.",1l1fuht,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1l1fuht/being_antivaccine_in_2025_is_like_refusing_clean/,65

vaccines,AcrobaticBullfrog142,1747998980.0,Am I risking overwhelming my immune system with too many vaccines in a short time?,"Hi,

  
I am having a very vaccine intensive year and I am wondering if maybe it is getting too much for my immune system, or should I not worry? I am in my late 30s and other than vaccine side effects, I have not had any symptomatic infectious disease for over 5 years so presumably my immune system is healthy. I would greatly appreciate any input!



It is my last year of having a great health insurance so I decided to get some vaccines that are a bit early for my age group, but I figured why not if I can get them paid for.

  
So in January I got Apexxnar (pneumococcus vaccine) and influenza vaccine, no side effects.

  
In February I got Shingrix I and in May Shingrix II. Both of them wiped me completely for 24 hrs with fever an all.

  
However, then unexpectedly I was scheduled to go to Indonesia for a bit over three weeks in August, followed by going to South Korea and Japan (each two weeks) and multiple African countries next year.

  
So a week ago I got Japanese encephalitis (ixiaro) and Meningococcus ACWY (Nimenrix) vaccines, got headache, nausea and irritability.

  
Yesterday I got the second Japanese encephalitis and RSV (RSV was optional, but I figured why not if the insurance covers) vaccines. Today I have headache, nausea and irritability.

  
Then 3 weeks from now I have Yellow Fever vaccine scheduled and a week before going to Indonesia I will get a polio booster.

  
I also will still need to get Tick Bourne Encephalitis booster at the end of the year, and also covid sometime in October.

  
Now on top of that I am thinking maybe I should get Cholera vaccine for diarrhea protection and I am also really on the fence about Dengue - I've spent 2.5 months in SEA before so there is a possibility I might have already had exposure and travel clinic thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated but it really doesn't work too well with the timelines. Should I somehow fit it in, if yes, any recommendations how?

  
Anyway, it's quite a lot of vaccinations in one year - do you think this is OK, or am I pushing myself a bit too hard and should maybe not get some of the vaccines? 

Thank you!

vaccines,Reecycle77,1747953215.0,Waning Immunity Questions,"Hello everyone! 

I know very little about vaccines other than the clear data that they are safe and effective. And that they work by either a very small dose of the live virus or doses of an inactive virus and they give your immune system practice basically to fight it off when it's a real infection.

My real question is about waning immunity. I know in some cases like Covid and the Flu, the vaccines loses effectiveness because the viruses themselves mutate and become different overtime. So boosters are basically giving you the newest dlc on the virus.

I was wondering though long term for waning immunization. Why is it so much faster for some vaccines compared to others? And does waning immunity mean that only infections go up because your system can't remember how to fight it fast enough? Or do hospitalizations/severity also increase significantly since the virus or bacteria could do enough damage before your system can remember how to fight it? Or is there a long enough period where your body legit completely loses all the information it had for a vaccine.

I'm very curious about the Hep A, Hep B, Typhoid, and Yellow Fever vaccines and mechanically how they lose effectiveness overtime!

I have recently developed a certain health anxiety, and the trigger for it is not too important but the conclusion was me getting a bunch of tests and delving into blood born diseases. Subsequently i found out from my parents that i do not have the hep b vaccine and i spent a few month spiraling into the idea of a possible chronic hep b that i might have, and being a threat to society. So after i checked first for the disease and then for antibodies i was thinking about getting the vaccine to never have to worry at least about this one thing again.

But, sort of expectedly, i now started to inform myself more on topic of vaccinations, which i never focused on before and it led to a whole new set of OCD anxiety. This time it’s about autoimmune responses to vaccines.

My parents vaccinated me as was required - at least against tetanus/diphtheria and measles, maybe also tuberculosis and other (would have to ask again). Not hep b. I also have 2 Moderna shots for Covid. 
I am very much not anti-vax, but i do believe that not all of the vaccines are studied enough to be taking them lightly ( *covid mostly comes to mind). And of course i am pretty sure that hep b vaccine is much safer, but my brain is finding it difficult right now to rationally judge the danger, and after i read about it being once upon a time associated with MS i cannot let go of it.

Could anyone here be the much needed voice of reason and tell me if there is actually something to be afraid of in case of getting a hep b vaccine as an adult - are there actually any consequences?   
Does the benefit outweigh the risks for an adult?

A SHOT IN THE DARK
HOW VACCINES BECAME TOO SUCCESSFUL
Parents—would you let your child visit a friend’s house where there was a loaded gun lying around? Dumb question, right? Yet every day in America we let millions of children risk picking up something just as deadly--preventable disease caused by failing to vaccinate children against common illnesses.
For the past four years, child vaccination rates have been declining. As a result, the incidence of many preventable childhood diseases such as measles, varicella (chicken pox), rubella (German measles) and (pertussis) whooping cough is on the rise. And the numbers are alarming. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), “As of Nov 9, there were more than 23,500 cases of whooping cough reported so far this year. That’s far and above the roughly 5,000 cases confirmed in all of 2023.” (The Hill) Statistics for measles are similarly grim, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting that “The number of measles cases around the world rose by 20% in 2023 compared with 2022, leading to an estimated 10.3 million cases.” The impact of lower vaccination rates for measles is especially grim; an estimated 107,500 people, mostly children younger than 5 years old, died from measles in 2023 (NBC News).
Whooping cough and measles vaccines are part of a recommended protocol that the CDC developed in 1995 and updates each year (2025 schedule). Until 2020, vaccination rates for diseases on that list held steady at 95% or above. For the past four years, however, rates have fallen, often significantly. Nationally, the vaccination rate for measles among children entering kindergarten fell to 93% in 2024. That 2% difference may seem small, yet multiple studies have confirmed that 95% is the threshold vaccination rate to establish herd immunity for communicable disease. 

Also, vaccination rates vary widely by state. The national averages for some childhood diseases may be at threshold, but that does little to protect children in many states where rates are notably lower. In Idaho, less than 82% of kindergartners have received the recommended doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Parents today may think of measles as little more than an irritating rash, perhaps because they have never seen it; measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. But the virus is far more than annoying for young children, among whom it can cause high fever, pneumonia, and even swelling of the brain (encephalitis). Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective in preventing disease, yet the CDC reports that 280,000 kindergartners are now unprotected from measles. This is alarming on many levels, but perhaps most important to note is that measles is shockingly contagious—9 in 10 unvaccinated people exposed to the virus will get measles. As vaccination rates have declined, outbreaks have returned, with 16 reported in 2024 so far.
Whooping cough outbreaks are increasing at an even faster rate than measles, with almost five times as many cases reported in 2024 as in 2023. Vaccines are highly effective at preventing pertussis and should be administered as part of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) protocol. The CDC recommends these shots be given at 2,4,6, and 15-18 months, plus one between 4-6 years. Unlike measles, immunity to whooping cough wears off, which means that teens should get a booster shot between 11-12 and every 10 years after that. Vaccination rates for teens have fallen to 89% nationally so that children for whom immunity is wearing off are increasingly at risk for contracting the disease.
TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL

At this point you may be wondering how so many kindergartners and teens remain unvaccinated given that all 50 states and Washington D.C. have laws requiring certain vaccines for students to attend school. Furthermore, most states align their requirements with recommendations from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control). However, all states allow exemptions. Primarily these exist for children who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons. In addition, many states allow exemptions for religious and or philosophical (personal) reasons. Allowances for non-medical exemptions vary widely by state, and you won’t be surprised to learn that they have been on the rise along with disease outbreaks. Furthermore, vaccine requirements apply to public schools only. The percent of children attending non-public schools has grown to 17% nationwide, while another 7% are homeschooled or attend virtual school. This means almost 1 in 4 school-aged children fall outside state vaccination requirements.
It is hard to imagine a worse environment for government officials to disparage vaccine efficacy, push conspiracy theories about their dangers, or even rescind requirements for them, yet here we are confronted with all three. Important as it is for politicians, pundits, and public health activists to denounce these developments, advocacy without action creates a doom loop of despair. What can concerned parents do to keep their kids safe?
FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT
Step one is knowing who is at greatest risk. Parents of very young children must be especially vigilant in avoiding exposure to unvaccinated people. Infants cannot receive a first dose of vaccines for certain diseases such as chicken pox, measles, and whooping cough. For example, kids cannot get their first dose of the MMR vaccine until 12 months and are not fully protected until their second dose at 4-6 years. Whooping cough is also dangerous, as babies do not develop full immunity until their third DTaP at 6 months, and can develop severe complications if they contract the illness. If you have older children, it’s important to know the vaccination status of their friends and cousins who might infect your infant. 
Even without infants in the household, parents should be aware of the vaccine status of the children’s playmates. And the only way to know is to ask. Many people feel uncomfortable having what they imagine to be difficult conversations with other parents, many of whom they know only from brief hellos at the bus stop. But you don’t need to feel awkward about protecting your child, nor must your conversations with other parents be confrontational. Try using one of these scripts before sending your child to visit a family you don’t know well. 
Finally, educate your family, friends, and neighbors about the real and present danger of rising rates of unvaccinated children. A good place to start is making others aware of just how spectacularly life-saving vaccines have been and still are. Few Americans today remember the many deadly diseases that afflicted children until the 1960s when vaccinations became available. Rather than try to counter unfounded beliefs about vaccine side effects, talk about vaccine success stories such as polio. In the mid-1950s. polio epidemics killed or paralyzed more than half a million people worldwide each year. In the United States alone, there were 21,000 cases in 1952; by 1993, there was only a single case. Similarly, the measles vaccine has saved nearly 94 million lives over the past 50 years. 
Public health is a public responsibility, but each of us has a role to play. 
Think globally; act locally.

It gets confusing as some are covered under Health Insurance (anything in a Doctor's office is usually health insurance) while Flu Shots, Covid, RSV, PCV are usually under your prescription benefit/insurance (if you get them at a Pharmacy) or both.

Thanks for the help - US Healthcare system is a mess  🤮 (and a discussion for another time), but it's especially confusing for me as my Healthcare benefit is through one insurance company and my Pharmacy benefit is through another, and they aren't in-network for each other.",1jzuq6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1jzuq6f/vaccine_coverage_insurance/,3

vaccines,GroundbreakingEye289,1744085690.0,Measles risk for unvaccinated infants,"Can someone help me understand the risk of this so I can decide what to do?

Prior to the measles outbreak my husband and I invited my husband’s friends to stay with us for a weekend in mid-April. They are all vaccinated but have a 6 month old baby who isn’t old enough to be vaccinated yet.  (He is breastfed if that makes a difference.)  Their older daughter in preschool just recieved her second MMR vaccine.  I have an (exclusively formula fed) 11 month old who won’t receive her MMR until May (after she turns 1).  They will be doing some traveling and visiting other people prior to visiting us. They say they try to do mostly outdoor activities but it’s hard to completely avoid going to indoor public places because of their lifestyle.  I have been avoiding all indoor public spaces with my baby since the outbreak and I feel like this outbreak is getting worse and not better.  We live in a mid-Atlantic state. They are from a state in the north east and will be traveling to Philadelphia prior to visiting us.  They say if we feel really uncomfortable that they can stay in a hotel and we can just meet up outdoors. I am risk adverse and would opt for this but I feel guilty and my husband isn’t on the same page and wants them to stay at our house for the weekend.

Given that measles is very contagious is it too risky for them to stay in my house?  My main concern is that the 6 month old could be exposed to Measles and infect my daughter.

vaccines,dabxsoul,1743046271.0,TDAP,"Let's remember rule #1 before commenting, because I am genuinely just very scared and need reassurance.

First mistake I made was searching up TDAP in reddit and came across some unvax threads where everyone says they got MS, GBS, etc. from getting the shot. I also saw a story of this man on fb that was hospitalized after getting it. I feel like saying these things don't happen doesn't do any good (at least not for me) because there are those small percentages of things that happen.

However, I very clearly have anxiety and I am point blank scared to be that tiny percentage, so before everyone tells me to not be an idiot and trust the science, understand that what I am looking for is compassion, guidance, and general understanding. I get the science is there. My fear is overpowering every cell in my being and it doesn't help when you have anxiety and OCD loops in your head that play out the worst case scenario.

So my practical question, to hopefully make myself feel better, is.. because I have had this shot before, a little less than ten years ago, does that make me less prone to having an adverse reaction? Is there a way to make this easier on myself?

I appreciate any help and compassion, shame on you if you just want to berate me for being scared and wanting guidance. I really appreciate the kind individuals out there.

  
EDIT: It would also really help if you could explain your symptoms when getting it, after getting it, how long they lasted, etc. so it helps me know what to expect. Thank you.",1jkuvk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1jkuvk8/tdap/,2

I’m wondering if there is any research that discusses celiac and how long you should wait to receive a live vaccine. 

That being said, I’m not understanding the 95% effective after one dose. What does this mean? 

“Even one dose of a measles vaccine provides protection against measles, explains Wilson. According to the Canadian Immunization Guide, a single dose of  measles vaccine given at 12 months or 15 months is between 85 and 95 per cent effective at protecting against measles.
While this effectiveness is high, Bolotin explains that a small number of individuals “don’t make an adequate immune response” after their first dose, meaning they could still contract or get really sick from measles. That’s why a second dose is recommended. After a second dose, the Canadian Immunization Guide states that measles vaccines are “almost 100 per cent” effective.”

Is this implying that the second one is only given to ensure everyone has immunity? We are getting her titres tested on Monday.

I hadn’t thought about rushing the MMR vaccine until now as her body is healing. I don’t even know if her gut is fully healed yet.

The past few years I somehow have gotten on a cycle where I've been getting my covid vaccine in February or March. My doctor has told me it's fine to go ahead and get the new one when it comes out in the Fall (even if it means it's not a full year in between), but my brain is just throwing a tantrum at me saying I should wait, and I'm probably still ""protected"". I get that there are different strains though, so maybe not as much. But then I start thinking about how Covid doesn't really usually spike in the winter anyway. 

It feels... super uncomfortable to me to be getting them so close together. Like, are we SURE there aren't any ill effects doing that? Has anyone else gotten a previous years vaccine in the spring, and then the new one the next Fall? I think I'd feel a lot better if I knew there were people who did this and were fine. My doctor just keeps reiterating I have nothing to worry about but hasn't managed to reassure me.

What if I just skipped this year and got the 25-26 covid vaccine as soon as it's available next Fall? That's a really stupid plan, right? 😅 Or should I just keep getting it in the Spring? I guess my main concern is that Covid may have already mutated a bunch since the Fall and the vaccine might not even be as effective by Spring?

Basically, I think I need y'all to help convince me I need to get the 24-25 covid vaccine now even though it's late (I know it spikes over the summer), and help me not be worried about getting the 25-26 one when it comes out? 

Why am I trusting random reddit users over my doctor? IDK y'all. There's power in numbers.. maybe if I hear it enough times? Thanks for reading my word vomit about this and for any thoughts y'all might have.

When people say the vaccine is ""97% effective"", does that mean a person with 2 MMR shots ony has a 3% chance of getting measles during their lifetime? Or during any outbreak? Or is it 3% chance per exposure? Or something else entirely?

Because if we're in an outbreak of measles where a person is experiencing lots of exposure ""events"", a 3% chance per exposure still seems to be a concerningly high chance of contracting measles. You wouldn't even need 100 exposures to contract measles (in terms of probability).

I freely admit I could be totally misunderstanding what the ""97%"" statistic means in terms of ""likelihood of contracting measles"". I am not even close to an expert on probability, statistics, or epidemiology. But it seems like even if my child has had both recommended MMR shots (and he has), if a true outbreak happens in our area the best course of action would still be to avoid public places where there is a risk of exposure.

Two at a time, one in each arm. Got both Shingles shots and first HepB (Hepislav-B).  Since measles has been in the news I figured I'd get an MMR booster with my second HepB.  I've only had the one shot in the early 1970s as a kid, back when there wasn't a combined shot and measles was separate.

Anyway I make the appointment for MMR and HepB but when I get there the pharmacist says that since MMR is a live vaccine it needs to be separated from other shots by 4 weeks.  He also berates me for not getting the second Hepislav-B right at a month (it's been six weeks).  I tried at four weeks and it got cancelled because they wanted at least 30 days.  I was busy at five weeks so that was the soonest I could get in.

From what I read, as long as you get both HepB shots sometime, you're covered.  And  I've never heard that the MMR has to be separate.  Is that true?

The pharmacist looked really busy and was pretty abrasive.  I suspect he just wanted me gone.  I ended up with just the second HepB.  I wasn't going to argue with someone who was going to stick a needle in my arm.  And it only took about 20 seconds.  He said to relax my arm,  three swabs with the alcohol wipe, stick, bandaid, done, goodbye.

As the title says, I finished all the stages of measles, got diagnosed by doctors and isolated.

I have no idea how I got it, and I am vaccinated. 

How likely is it that I got it from my spouse, if she works at a kindergarten? 
She didn't have any simptoms and is also vaccinated, but about 50% of the kids in her group are not. 

Also how likely is it that I will have any complications later on from this.



I am so frustrated, as I had 7 days of pain because people refuse to vaccinate their kids. 
Why is everyone so happy with exposing their kids to possibly dieing?

Controlled diabetes
Fully Vaccinated as a child

Today I got the MMR and Hep B vaccine and I just wanted to know adult experiences with the MMR since most I've read are about children. My titers were checked and I was low on measles and mumps. I was afraid to get it at first bc of reactions and whether it was safe or not and it being a live vaccine but I figured it would be better than risking getting the illnesses with no protection. I feel like one of my lymph nodes in my neck are on the side I got the shot is swollen a little and I am tired and shoulder area sore. I am debating on if I want the second one or if I can just have this one and be fine pending on if any other side effects pop up. What have been your experiences? 

Update Day #1: Figured this could help anyone who's in a similar situation.  no fever, lymph node seems to have gone down  not super swollen so tbh don't know if it's swollen or if I'm just not used to touching it to see so it may be regular size😅 sore shoulders and neck area resulting in a tension headache that tiger balm alleviates. The eye on the side of the MMR vaccine is watery but I'm unsure if it is vaccine related or allergy related since allergy season started. 😅I take daily vitamins and supplements for immunity boosts anyway so not sure if that's helping to alleviate larger reactions. I'm sleepy but honestly it could be bc I'm off work and catching up on rest but either way I'm pretty much ok today.

Update Day #2&3: I think my lymph node is back to regular on the one side, I cannot feel it as pronounced anymore. I'm tired but that also could be bc of the time change and I didn't sleep too well last night for other reasons. (Not bad just had family over lol) I had a pretty good tension headache keep lasting bc I wasn't taking anything for it and my sister convinced me to finally take Tylenol and I took it once each day and felt pretty good on that. Still taking my supplements and eating as healthy as I can so looks good so far. I'll probably update again at the week mark so it isn't so frequently boring. 😅

Update Day #9-11: on the shoulder I got the MMR vaccine there is a painful lump area, no red skin, but it's warm and only painful when I touch it or move my arm a certain way. Went to the ER they said it's not infected, to do warm compress therapy and take ibuprofen going to a check up today just so my doctor is aware of what's going on. Definitely not getting the second shot, one should be enough, that'll be 3 I've had during my lifetime. ",1j52hh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1j52hh3/mmr_vaccine_adult_experiences/,24

Apparently I had no antibodies and they questioned whether I received the MMR vaccine as a child at all (I did and I’ve check records since).

We currently have a 10 month old and he travels often for work so l've been a little worried. Good news, his levels came back great.

How common is it that people need boosters? Am I right to be a little anxious about our infant and would you recommend we talk to our pediatrician about getting her first dose early (we live in Utah)?

Just curious if anyone has additional insight as to why I had no antibodies and what that could be called. Side note, there have been several doctors, dentists, and dermatologists be surprised when I can feel pain after being administered local anesthesia and epidural (both births).

This thought experiment interests me because the same rationale for choosing to get the rabies vaccine could be extrapolated out onto other vaccines. Rabies is scary as hell because it’s a certain threat. If other preventable diseases like measles and polio were viewed as that threatening, perhaps more people would evaluate their vaccines based on the true risk/benefit ratio. With these other diseases, people have the luxury of taking an anti-vax stance because they haven’t faced the devastation they cause.

When I went to work for the VA hospital in 2010, they made me get my immunity titers done. At the time, I tested not immune for measles, despite having three documented shots.  At the time, my doctor said it was not necessary to get another booster, as there was really no outbreak and according to the CDC I had immunity because of my documented tests in spite of the lab work. Given that measles seems to be circulating again in some areas (not my state, yet, but I like to be proactive), I decided to get my titer retested and get revaccinated if necessary.  I am again showing no immunity to measles (< 13.50 AU/mL) I have high antibody levels for mumps and rubella.

vaccines,MikeGinnyMD,1740603943.0,I'm a pediatrician.  Here is my advice to parents about measles.,"With the recent Texas measles outbreak and the tragic report of the death of a young child this morning, many of my patients' parents and also my friends are asking what they should do.  

First, you should look into if there are measles cases near you.  Because this outbreak occurred in an undervaccinated region that is not near a large city and a region that is not a major tourist destination (unlike the 2015 Disneyland outbreak), it is likely to stay mostly localized.  If you are outside of this area, you should monitor the situation but it's not necessary to take any special precautions at this time.

These recommendations are based on AAP Red Book and ACIP/CDC guidelines.  This is not specific medical advice and I am a doctor, but not your child's doctor, so please consult with your child's pediatrician.

If your child has a special condition that affects the immune system (cancer, transplant, rheumatologic condition) you should ask the specialist that manages that condition rather than following this advice.

* **Newborn through 5mo:** 
   * If there is no measles activity in your local area, continue to monitor the situation
   * If there is a suspected or confirmed exposure, your child should receive a dose of either Measles Immune Globulin or if that is not available, Human Normal Immune Globulin within six days of the exposure.  This will substantially reduce the risk of symptomatic measles disease and the severity of that illness should it occur.  Your child should not receive a measles vaccine for five months after receiving measles immune globulin as it may reduce the efficacy of that vaccine
* **6mo through 11mo:** 
   * You may discuss with your pediatrician whether an early dose of measles vaccine (MMR) is appropriate.  I personally would not refuse such a request.  A dose of the vaccine at 6mo is only about 60% effective, but will likely reduce the severity of symptoms if measles does occur.  You should especially consider this if you are considering travel that will be in or near the area of an outbreak or traveling internationally to a country with high prevalence of measles.
   * If there is a suspected or confirmed exposure, a dose of measles vaccine should be given within three days of that exposure.
   * A dose of measles vaccine given before the first birthday does not count towards the normal immunization schedule and needs to be repeated after the first birthday but no sooner than 3mo after the last dose.
* **12mo through 3 years 11mo:**
   * Your child should receive a dose of MMR as soon as possible after his or her first birthday.
   * You may discuss with your pediatrician whether an additional dose of measles vaccine is appropriate.  The single dose given at 12mo is 93% effective at preventing symptomatic measles disease so I generally consider this unnecessary, but would not refuse such a request.  An additional dose must be given no sooner than 3mo after the previous dose.  Additional doses given before the 4th birthday do not count towards the normal immunization schedule and needs to be repeated after the 4th birthday but no sooner than 3mo after the first dose.  
   * If your child has not had their measles vaccine yet and is exposed, you should get the measles vaccine within three days of exposure.
* **4yo and older:** 
   * Your child should receive the second dose of MMR as soon as possible after his or her 4th birthday.
   * Additional doses are not necessary.
   * If your child has not had the second dose after the 4th birthday and has a suspected or confirmed exposure, they should receive that dose within three days of the exposure.
   * If your child has had both doses of MMR, then you need take no further special precautions.  Two doses of MMR are 97% effective at preventing measles and substantially and significantly reduce the severity of breakthrough cases.
   * Antibody titer testing is not necessary.",1iyy9wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1iyy9wg/im_a_pediatrician_here_is_my_advice_to_parents/,114

My titer test was 5.6 back before I got pregant in 2023 (doc didn't provide units, I sent them a message to ask). It seems that number may not mean immunity however. I had MMR twice on schedule as a kid (I'm 33 this year).

I now have an 8 month old, I am breastfeeding. 

It sounds like I need a booster, okay, no problem. But I have questions my doctor, my pediatrician, and Google can't seem to answer. I can't seem to find any evidence. I crave sources or at least someone who knows what they're talking about. 

#1 If my kid needs dose zero of MMR because this outbreak spreads is there any concern if I've also recently boosted and am breastfeeding? Say within that window where it is found in my breastmilk... could she be more at risk? Could she experience complications?

#2 If I get my booster and continue to breastfeed (as is my plan for at least 1-1.5  years) does the passive immunity my kid gets from me ruin her ability to acquire immunity during her 12 month MMR? I was told the reason MMR is at 12 months (or dose zero needs to be given after 6 months and before 12 and then again after 12) is because the maternal antibodies will suppress the vaccine form being effective. Is this the case if I'm passing anything to her via breastmilk? 

Help, my health anxiety is running rampant. I want my kiddo and I protected. I just can't wait for her to turn a year, which is sad because I want to cherish each moment. I just want her to get her MMR protection. 

Thank you. 


P.S. My kiddo is not great at bottles and not on solids so not breastfeeding is not an option. I live in New England, but I know outbreaks can spread fast. She stays home and isn't in daycare. But Dad and Nanny are in public, as are my parents. I work from home. I have chosen not to take my baby in public during respiratory season because ain't nobody got time for that (plus I rarely leave the farm as it is!).

vaccines,hookup1092,1740542659.0,Is an antibody titers test necessary before updating vaccines as an adult? (25M),"I’m currently looking to schedule a titers test with my PCP to check for antibodies against diseases like chickenpox, measles-mumps-rubella, and hepatitis B, and get boosters for them. However, last year, I opted for a Varicella booster due to an error I observed with my childhood immunization records, and without a titers test first.

Given that, is it necessary to get a titers test first, or can I skip it and just get the boosters for MMR and HepB? Are there any specific risks to getting these vaccines again as an adult, beyond the typical risks associated with vaccines? Should I follow any particular schedule for safety and to boost immune response?

And they dragged my mom into their delusions.  Granted, she's one of those 70-somethings that think ""the internet"" is Facebook. She did give all three of her kids all their vaccines growing up (44-50).

The story:  I was talking to my mother on the 16th, and she brought up a story about some people from her church who went to Ghana to see the school they sponsor. Now, I'm going to make up a bit of a timeline based on the little bit of reading and what I would do if I was travelling from Canada to Africa.

Dude has to get some vaccines to go, and apparently reacted to the Dengue Fever shot  My quick search to see what the waiting period before travel showed that this one is not done here, so I'm guessing they probably mean Yellow Fever.   
  
Now this also means that the latest he would have been able to get it before leaving was 10 days earlier. I also wouldn't go to Africa myself for less than 10 days.  They also either re-routed or came home only to leave from the airport within a day or so and spent a week in Mexico.

Both of these places are nearer the equator than our beloved home.  He had just gotten home on the 15th. So let's say that Feb 15th - 7 days in Mexico - 10 days in Africa - 10 days before leaving getting the shot = Getting the shot on on or about January 17 2025.

My mother knew he reacted to the shot and assumed that his red, peeling face and neck were still a reaction to the vaccine.  She has a red-headed daughter and a very pale strawberry blonde granddaughter.  I'm the redhead.  I'm also allergic to tree nuts.  She knows what allergies look like.  She knows what sunburn looks like.  But no.  This dude is still looking like he has a reaction to a vaccine a minimum of a month after he got vaccinated.

I think 9 years ago there was a bigger ""wave"" of people who mistrusted the vaccine. Today, they claim that they've seen that the vaccine is effective. And by now the vaccine has been around for way longer...

I don't know what to do!! My grandma had cancer in the uterus, not the cervix. I don't know the cause, perhaps old age (since cancer in the uterus is more common in older ages) or the fact that she had breast cancer 20 years earlier.

Anyway, I'm a virgin and when I start having sex I don't plan to sleep around because that's not my thing (there's a reason I'm a virgin). However, I know that's no guarantee because the man can have HPV and pass it on. You never know if they'll cheat either.. And obviously you never know if someone sexually assaults you.

Shouldn't pap smears be enough? They've been around for a looong time after all without having to inject something in you.

I know this is a choice I need to make myself but I honestly need some more insights, please.

**Update in case anyone finds this post because they're looking for an answer:** I took the first shot. I got a little dizzy afterwards, probably because I was scared. I feel better now (about 3h later). Will update if I notice any other side effects.

It wasn’t until I was 16 years old that I finally started learning more about biology (which of course includes the basics about viruses) and over time, I changed my mind and realized that vaccines actually train our immune systems to protect us from potentially deadly diseases and that refusing to vaccinate means putting your health and well being in danger. 

For over a decade, I’ve been holding on to anger and resentment at my parents (my mother in particular) that they refused to vaccinate me all because they believe that vaccines cause autism and that the government can control us due to chips and trackers in the vaccines. I feel like by not vaccinating me as a child, they gave me a potential death sentence that I was lucky enough to escape. I feel like because of that I can never trust my parents with any health decisions or advice ever again, why should I trust what they say when they left me vulnerable, potentially to die? 

Now that I am about to have a child of my own, they will be fully vaccinated, on schedule, and get the full benefits of their immune system getting the training it deserves. I have every intention of slamming my foot down as hard as I can about this and make it crystal clear that their grandchildren are going to be fully vaccinated and that there’s nothing they can do about it. I’m slowly starting to not give a sh*t what my parents think about my decision to vaccinate my kids instead of following the anti-vaxx rabbit hole like they did, they permanently lost my trust that they know what’s best for me and my kids.

vaccines,TwoSolesAbroad,1736805684.0,PSA for Anyone Looking for the Qdenga Vaccine (Dengue),"Hey everyone! I’m making this post for people trying to figure out where to get the Qdenga vaccine because honestly, it was SUCH a hassle for us to figure it out. 😅



We got our first dose in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**, and let me tell you, it was a pain in the… You have to schedule it with **Stamboulian**, and here’s the link: [https://turnoslab.ar/vacuna-dengue.php](https://turnoslab.ar/vacuna-dengue.php).

**BUT the trick is:** we could ONLY register at **12 AM** (midnight) for the following week, and the spots go insanely fast. We booked at 12:00 AM, and by 12:01 AM, there was no availability left. So, yeah, be ready to refresh like crazy.  


For the second dose, we decided to go to **Colombia**, and OMG, it was a breeze compared to Argentina. Just contact the **Red Cross (Cruz Roja)** in the city you’re in (we checked Cartagena, Bogotá, and Medellín), and they all had availability.

They can even come to your house for an extra fee, so you don’t even have to leave. We just got our **second dose today in Cartagena**, and it was SO easy. Tbh, I didn’t even know Colombia had the vaccine available, so I hope this helps someone searching for it! (plus Colombia is absolutely amazing, so you can’t go wrong here)



Both times, the vaccine cost around **$70 USD**. (300,000 COP in Colombia and 70,000 ARS in Argentina)



**Here are the WhatsApp numbers for the Red Cross in Colombia:**

* **Cartagena:** \+57 317 2180488
* **Medellín:** \+57 300 7098112
* **Bogotá:** \+57 317 3638993



Quick FYI:

* You can also get Qdenga in **most of Europe** (but it’s pricier—around **$100-$200 USD**) and in **Thailand** (as far as I know).
* You need the **second dose exactly 90 days after the first** (not before and not too far after) for it to work.
* It’s effective for at least **4.5 years**, but they don’t have longer studies yet.



Hope this post helps someone! Seriously, knowing Colombia had it would’ve saved us so much stress. 🙌

I've been experiencing similar issues to what would be carpal tunnel: weakness in hand/finger muscles.

vaccines,kaion76,1736313198.0,Measles - vaccines not lifelong and booster needed?,"Hi all,

I have read in many places that MMR vaccines with 2 doses are lifelong. However, I just came across a Taiwan news article (no English source but see translation below - [1患者可傳染20人！麻疹威力驚人「戴口罩也難防」45歲以下這樣保健康 | 生活百科 | 橘世代](https://orange.udn.com/orange/story/121406/8475993?from=udn_idlepage_ch2)) that a professor in public health from National Taiwan University recommended Taiwanese born after 1980s to get booster as the protection from vaccines decline after 10 years and there is a global spike in measles case which justify booster.

May I know from a scientific / health (rather than cost and benefit public health) perspective, does it really make sense? I know from public health perspective sometimes we don't recommend boosters as the cost is high while protection is marginal (such as doing 3 dose gardasil vs 1 dose or teenagers getting PCV PPSV). But then is it worth to do so if cost is not an issue? The article suggested on the basis that Taiwanese should get it when there is excess supply.

>The global measles epidemic has also seen the worst hospital cluster in recent years in Taiwan. Chen Hsiu Hsi, a professor at the Department of Epidemiology and Pre-medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many newborns to not be vaccinated, and the peak period of foreign travel has also caused infection. For people under the age of 45, since the vaccine protection year has come, it is recommended that additional vaccinations be given under the premise of the national vaccine quota to effectively prevent the epidemic.

>""Measles is highly contagious. One person with measles can infect at least 20 people."" Chen Hsiu Hsi said that Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia have serious epidemics. With international travel, the epidemic has spread to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Therefore, Taiwanese people who travel abroad need to pay special attention to whether they are infected. Most measles patients are asymptomatic. Those with symptoms have conjunctivitis on the buttocks and pigmentation on the tongue scattered throughout the body. A small number of vulnerable people will still develop pneumonia, and the public is urged to pay special attention.

>""As the international epidemic heats up, countries are scrambling for vaccines. If the domestic vaccine is sufficient, it is still recommended that people born after 1980 should receive additional doses of the vaccine."" Chen Chen Hsiu Hsi said that before 1980, the country had not implemented a measles vaccination policy, and many people knew that Measles immunity is generated through natural infection, and its effect lasts for a long time. People who were vaccinated after 1980 are less likely to be naturally infected with measles and develop protection. However, the protection of the vaccine lasts for about 10 years, so it is recommended to take additional doses.",1hwc70t,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1hwc70t/measles_vaccines_not_lifelong_and_booster_needed/,9

how expensive (in USA) would it be to be caught up on your vaccines?

I then fed it the characteristics of measles epidemics (number of people, r-naught, etc.). Here are the results... Should not be surprising to those who are initiated:

* The lower the vaccination level, the higher the average number of cases.
* The lower the vaccination level, the lower the number of survivors (people who are not infected).
* The lower the vaccination level, the lower the length of the epidemic before anyone susceptible became infected and there were no more susceptible people.

It shouldn't surprise you that vaccination levels above the herd immunity threshold lead to lower number of cases, more people who are not infected, and the cases are so far and few in between that the ""outbreak"" lasts months.

Cue the antivaxxers: ""The more we vaccinate, the longer the outbreaks of measles last!""

Hoping someone can shed some light on this topic.

* It seems that the WHO study did not name the vaccine. Can we assume that Gardasil 4 and Gardasil 9 and any others are all in scope here? Some of them have 2 dose for full course and some have 3 dose
* The study seems to cover female only, could we say the same for male?
* How do they actually get confident in this since the immunity may wane off over time. Wouldn't there be possibilities that 3 dose gives you lifelong immunity while 1 dose makes you protected for 10 years?
* They recommended two dose for older than 21, why is that the case though when younger girls only receiving 1 dose?

>SAGE recommends updating dose schedules for HPV as follows:

>**one or two-dose schedule** for the primary target of girls aged **9-14**

>**one or two-dose schedule** for young women aged **15-20**

>Two doses with a 6-month interval for women **older than 21**.

* This seems to be adopted even in some developed countries like UK but not yet adopted by CDC. Is it more because US is conservative or wealthier on this and can afford everyone going 3 dose or should I be wary the scientists at CDC are still undecided on the approach?
* The main argument for it being less effective on older girls is because it is useless for that strain if you are infected.

I had a big reaction the next day, I could barely get out of bed and felt like I had a flu. But IMO that's not concerning, just a big immune response in a young woman (expected as far as my understanding) 

What was concerning was that, the swelling in my arm didn't go down for weeks! Two weeks after I had a squishy golf ball size knot at the site of injection pop up (but no redness or heat, it went away in about 48 hours, so weird!) My shoulder joint also hurt for weeks/a few months after. It wasn't until after it dissipated I learned about SIRVA, so I couldn't seek a diagnosis. 

No long term damage from either, and I want to get another booster. But I am a little concerned at if that reaction was just placement and/or a localized reaction? I am mainly concerned about the lasting shoulder pain. I've gotten a dozen vaccines since then, and that level of reaction hasn't happened again. 

Should I tell them when I get my next Tdap (hopefully in January) that I had this reaction/SIRVA last time? I'm also a fairly small person, idk if that effects the mapping.",1gtaulj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1gtaulj/previous_sirvashoulder_reaction_to_tdap/,3

The Spin

Narrative A

The world is on a positive path toward eradicating malaria — from billions of cases prevented to millions of lives saved. While there's still more work for governments to accomplish, including preventive strategies like vaccines, mosquito sprays, and bed nets, as well as other treatments, we are for the first time in a strong position to end rather than merely control this disease.

Narrative B

The fight against malaria is far from over. Cases have stagnated since 2015 and are rising in parts of Africa as mosquitoes develop resistance to nets and sprays. Low-income countries lack resources for prevention, while vaccines face distribution challenges. Without sustained global commitment and ever-evolving tools, even our modest gains could be lost.

AI: It's great that you're staying proactive about your health! However, getting five vaccines in such a short span of time might not be the best approach. The immune system can become overwhelmed, and it's generally recommended to space out vaccines to ensure each one is effective and to monitor for any potential side effects.

vaccines,NT202,1727728300.0,Confused about getting the HPV vaccine as a man,"Hi, 

I've only ever slept with one person. I was in a relationship since I was 18 that ended a few years ago, but now I've met someone new. As you can imagine, sex brings up a lot of stress for me in general given I don't really have a lot of experience, but one of the main things I've been worried about is HPV -- specifically the cancer-causing strains that can cause penile or oral cancer.

I'm at the point with this new girl where we're ready for that, but I can't get the HPV risk out of my head. Unfortunetly, I've just missed out on being able to get the vaccine for free here in the UK (the cap is 25), so I'll have to pay for it privately, but I'm a bit confused. 

From what I understand, before, for people my age, it was three doses: the initial one, another one to two months after, and then a third booster six months after the first. So you were mostly fully protected against the cancer-causing strains after the first two, and then the third just enhanced the longevity of it and provided further protection for the low-risk strains. If this was the case, after the second I'd be comfortable having sex being mostly protected, and most importantly, it would be nice and quick.

Now, though, things seem to have changed: it's now two doses spaced six months apart, with the first only giving you 50-60% protection. 

So I kinda feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I mean that's kind of a massive chemistry killer to have to say 'oh, I'm getting the HPV vaccine so we need to wait seven months before we do anything'. (given you have to wait another 30 days after the first dose to be fully protected as well) But at the same time, if I don't, there's what seems like quite a substantial risk of cancer...or maybe I'm overflowing it?

I'm really hoping this isn't as crap a situation as I'm thinking it is, so can anyone provide me some clarification? Just feeling pretty confused right now. From what I gather everyone should be having this vaccine and I've just missed the boat.

vaccines,NotHere2FuckSpiders,1727643493.0,From Vaccine Virgin to Mpox Maverick: My Wild Ride into the World of Vaccines,"Alright, Reddit, buckle up. I've always been that guy, the one who never got vaccinated. Not because I was scared, but because, well, I was perfectly healthy. Like, Superman levels of health. No colds, no flus, just pure, unadulterated human perfection.

The Backstory:

- Vaccine Virgin: Yep, you read that right. Never. Not once. Not even a flu shot. My body, my temple, and I was the high priest.

- The Perfect Health Paradox: ""Why fix what ain't broke?"" was my motto. I could outrun any sickness, or so I thought.

- The Mpox Madness: Then came mpox, with its shiny new clade 1b variant. Suddenly, my fortress of solitude seemed less like a bastion of health and more like a lonely, vulnerable island.

The Unhinged Epiphany:

- The Dark Web of Information: I went down rabbit holes that would make conspiracy theorists blush. From fringe forums to obscure scientific papers, I was on a quest not just for truth, but for survival.

- The Reddit Factor: That's when I found it, a post on Reddit.  Some random guy, probably morbidly obese and living in his mom's basement, had a revelation about vaccines that made me pause. ""Vaccines are like cheat codes for your immune system,"" he said.

- The Decision: In a moment of sheer, unhinged clarity, I decided, ""Why not?"" If the world was going to throw viruses at me like a cosmic game of dodgeball, I needed armor.

The Shot Heard 'Round My Life:

I walked into the clinic like a man possessed. The nurse looked at me like I was an alien. ""You've never been vaccinated? At all?""

- The First Jab: That needle went in, and I swear, I felt my body go, ""What the heck is this?""

- The Mpox Vaccine: Then came the mpox shot. Now, I was officially part of the vaccinated club, but not just any club, the elite resistance fighters against a global outbreak.

Why I'm Now a Vaccine Evangelist:

- The Invincibility Illusion: Turns out, my ""perfect health"" was a house of cards. One bad day, one mutant virus, and I could've been toast.

- The Community Angle: Vaccines aren't just about me; they're about us. I'm now a shield, not just for myself, but for every grandma, every kid, every human I cross paths with.

- The Science Is Lit: From being a skeptic to a believer, the science behind these vaccines is like magic if magic was real, provable, and saved lives.

The Conclusion:

Reddit, if a guy who was never vaccinated, who prided himself on never needing them, can come around, maybe there's hope for everyone. Vaccines are like the ultimate plot armor in this wild game of life.

So, here I am, unhinged with enthusiasm, preaching the gospel of vaccines. From a vaccine virgin to a mpox maverick, my life's taken a turn. And you know what? It feels like I've unlocked a new level of existence.

Stay safe, stay wild, and maybe, just maybe, get vaccinated. It's a wild ride.

The public (tax-supported) medical system in my province (Alberta) in Canada since COVID gives at no cost the stronger flu vaccine to those 65+

But the senior flu shot is not available until same time as normal one (Oct. 15) Only options are...

1. Find a care home that will inject me when they operate their program
2. Have paid in the summer to reserve for the winter. It is not the standard senior one 

It all sounds rather bureaucratic and complicated, and mostly doesn't fit my travel schedule  I did not know flu vaccines were so problematic. I don't mind so much the private pay of $70 (CAD) It's the non-availability and hassle that is disappointing. 

Reminds me of the run around trying to get the COVID shot in 2021. I flew to Belgrade to get the free immunization offered by Serbia's President only to see it cancelled soon after I arrived.   

I read of this non-availability in USA but thought Canada is in a better healthcare situation. I was wrong. It is the same or worse here. I think there is the ideology here that no one should be able to 'jump the queue' lest richer persons get faster/sooner healthcare. Doesn't make sense to me because doing so shortens the line for everybody else and increases herd immunity, no? Maybe there is no conspiracy of communists and it is a simple matter of how vaccine preparation works. Maybe they decide at the last minute what 4 strains to protect against based on data?

In any case, not gonna happen.  Is the flu even a big thing in Asia? If all else fails I can get it in Tokyo or Bangkok presumably.

This year I have been around a ton of people at work coughing their heads off and claiming to have COVID a week ago.  Honestly I am less sure that they have COVID because they are always looking for an excuse to work from home, and I simply authorized that to not have them around anyone if truthfully for a week.  Regardless I have been around them a bit and some others.

After my flu vaccine I went shopping at Costco an hour later and had some very minor cold chills I shook off by the time I was back in the car.  Upon eating dinner my nose started running more than normal (I have gustatory rhinitis, which just means my nose sometimes runs when I eat … you know like if you eat hot peppers your nose runs only it happens with other foods too but it is inconsistent and clears just as quick as it does when you stop eating peppers).  This time it seemed like that but a bit worse and I couldn’t shake the nose running and took some Allegra 12 hour (not the decongestant) and some Flonase just because I had some.  Also did an Abbot COVID rapid test and got a “presumptive negative” (not even a faint line).

My nose was NOT completely congested and it got a bit better with the Allegra and a shower.  I played a multiplayer computer game with a friend until 4 am, and my nose was 80% better by then.  I took another Allegra 12 hour and went to bed waking up with a mild sore throat around 10 am nose 90% better.  I gargled with some mouthwash for my throat and went back to bed until noon.  

I had the exact same tacos for lunch as dinner only no runny nose symptoms. Usually I don’t have gustatory rhinitis for breakfast anyway.   Then I had them for lunch and dinner. No symptoms.   By about 2 pm I am 100% better.

This strange runny nose issue lasted 16 hours.

Was it vaccine related?

Should I avoid flu shots in the future?  (I hope not because I really feel they work and historically have been 100% side-effect free.)

vaccines,jas41422,1725482633.0,RSV vaccination,"tldr: Does RSV vaccination of adults prevent actual *infection with* the virus, or does it mostly reduce severity of disease once an adult becomes infected with the virus?

more context for my question:

I’m in my early 60s and take care of babies ~ 6-20 mos old. My main rationale for wanting to get vaccinated against RSV is to help prevent me from getting it from one baby and inadvertently passing it along to another baby while asymptomatic and/or undiagnosed. I took care of babies one at a time a couple of years ago and am nearly positive I got RSV from at least one of them, but my symptoms were mild and I didn’t suffer any lingering issues. But since it seems immunity is not long-lasting and we now have a vaccine, it seemed like a good idea to get one now that I’m caring for babies from different families on consecutive days. I talked with my PCP a few weeks ago and he agreed it would be a good idea.

I went to a drugstore today (nationwide chain known for pharmacy services) and they ran my insurance and said there would be $0 co-pay. Yay. But then the pharmacist told me the CDC guidance had changed very recently, and he was unable to vaccinate me because I’m not => 75 years old and I don’t live in a nursing home or have a medical condition that would put me at risk of severe disease if infected with RSV. “But I take care of babies and my PCP recommended I get the vaccination” did nothing to change the pharmacist’s stance.

I looked at the CDC guidance again and noticed it seems to emphasize reduced severity of disease, not protection against becoming infected with the virus. So now I’m wondering whether the RSV vaccines for adults actually prevent infection (and therefore transmission) or whether they mainly simply reduce severity after infection occurs.

I’d been thinking about this more from a public health standpoint than a personal preventive standpoint, sort of like the herd immunity we rely on to protect vulnerable kids from pertussis.

Any virology/immunology experts on here who can help
me better understand this RSV vaccine thing? Thanks in advance!",1f944hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1f944hm/rsv_vaccination/,5

vaccines,jfinkl,1725295641.0,Possible accidental misuse of qdenga - advice needed,"Hi there,

I have a question regarding potential accidental misuse of Qdenga (dengue vaccine). My travel doctor gave me the first dose of qdenga on 30 may of this year, the second dose was today. There is a chance that at the first time the doctor did not inject the vaccine subcutaneous, but instead intramuscular (I also received a TBE booster at the same time in the other shoulder, and there was a bit of a mixup, so it might have happened accidentally)
The second vaccination definitely happened subcutaneous.
I’d like to know if there’s any information available of the risks/efficacy/level of protection of qdenga if the first (or all) injection happened subcutaneous, and secondly if there is any information available on what would happen if because of this I now ask for a third vaccination to make sure I definitely receive two correct vaccinations. Is there any information available on this, and/or can anybody give any advice on whetherir would be ok/beneficial to go for that option?
It’s a relatively new vaccine, so there might not be any information available. What I did hear through is that the risk of getting dengue (or of it turning bad when you get it) is actually higher with just one vaccination, so I’m very much interested in making sure that I do what protects me the best).


The packaging states that you shouldn’t use qdenga intramuscular, but doesn’t explain why (maybe has not been studied yet).

In case it matters: I live in the Netherlands. I’ll travel to the Red Sea area of Egypt in 15 days.
I’ll definitely deet up properly when I’m there.

They are suspicious of vaccines although I'm not sure they are completely antivax bc my dad did voluntarily get a shingles vaccine. He also got the COVID vaccine but moreso bc he had to for his job.

Anyways, given the fact that my parents never got me vaccinated for anything ever and I was raised around being suspicious of them, I am now afraid of them. I am 22 and can get vaccinated if I want, but I am very afraid.

I am also autistic with severe anxiety and ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) and the subtypes I have of it are sensory related and fear related. So being afraid of getting sick or having negative effects from eating certain foods. And it applies to medicine and vitamins as well. I don't think it can apply to vaccines bc they're a whole different thing but the same type fear still applies. Plus it is worse with it being something new I've never done before that I grew up hearing negative things about.

I know I definitely should get the tdap vaccine. My doctor specifically mentioned that one especially. I don't know all the vaccines but that one is important bc I don't want to get tetanus. And there are probably others I should get but I don't think I could get more than one at once. I would be too anxious and I don't want to overdo it and make myself sick with anxiety.

I feel bad for being so scared but I really can't help it. I don't know how to get around it so I can at least for now get the tdap one. I thought maybe people here might have advice. And maybe could you help me figure out the top three important vaccines I need? So hopefully I can come up with a sort of plan with the ones to prioritize right now? I know I need the tdap one for sure. But idk all the vaccines and what is what. If it is important I have never had chicken pox and I think there might be a vaccine for it? But I am not sure how important that is to get. If it should be more top priority or not. 

Also, maybe could somebody explain what getting a vaccine is like? How is it done and what does it feel like and things like that? Knowing how things work ahead of time is really important for me.

It is a deal breaker if i can’t. The flu shot is always an easy yes for me. I can easily mitigate a mildly sore bicep by moving my arm around. Benadryl ointment and an ice pack if it is bad. The flu fucks me up, way worse than any minor flu shot side effects.

I am unsure if one dose will be sufficient In a titers test and from what I have read you should not get the MMR vaccine while pregnant. 


They did the titer test. Just pending results. My question is I’m not exactly sure how titers works. Does it measure the percentage of immunity? Will the one dose give a positive titer result ?

Many countries first recommended that adults of a certain age (it varies from country to country, usually 65 years and older) receive a dose of the 23-valent PPV-23 (also known as the PPSV-23, Pneumovax, Pneumovax-23...) after it was first licensed in the early 1980s, although some started first by recommending vaccination to people with certain comorbidities first. I'm interested in the year that vaccination was recommended on the basis of age, not comorbidities.

Some countries are proving far more difficult than others. I know the years for Germany (1998), Australia (1999 for the native population first, 2005 for the rest), Belgium (1996), UK (2003) and The Netherlands (2018), but I can't find anything for the following countries:

* Austria
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Italy

Using Google Translate on the web pages of their public health authorities usually only shows the most recent recommendations, never the date when the recommendations were first published. Maybe this information has been lost to time in some countries, I don't know.

vaccines,Immediate-Initial-49,1721636399.0,Temporary and partial reduction of mucosal immunity following administration of Bexsero vaccine?,"There is a 2008 scientific study called: ""Mucosal immunity in healthy adults after parenteral vaccination with outer membrane vesicles from Neisseria Meningitidis Serogroup B"". The conclusion was :""Parenteral vaccination induced a marked increase in systemic T cell immunity against MenB and a Th1 bias. In contrast, although mucosal T cell proliferation in response to MenB neither increased nor decreased following vaccination, mononuclear cell interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-10 production increased, and the Th1/Th2 profile lost its Th1 bias. Parenteral MenB vaccination selectively reprograms preexisting naturally acquired mucosal immunity. "" The authors go on to say that:""Recent stud-ies ofHelicobacter pyloriandS. pneumoniaeinfection in animalshave shown that mucosal clearance after vaccination withprotein-based vaccines is independent of B cell function [42, 43].Mucosal Th1-dominated immunity is mediated through activa-tion of macrophages and NK cells, enhanced FcR1 expressionon phagocytes, neutrophil mobilization, and induction ofcomplement-fixing and opsonizing antibodies [44, 45]. Thus aloss of Th1 bias in the mucosal compartment may compromise protection against carriage and invasion"".

!!!""Thus aloss of Th1 bias in the mucosal compartment may compromise protection against carriage and invasion""!!!

The vaccine used in this study is MeNZb produced by Novartis and is the forerunner of Bexsero vaccine produced by Novartis (later bought by GSK). In Bexsero, this OMV from the NZ98/254 strain is combined with additional antigens (factor H binding protein [fHbp], Neisserial adhesin A [NadA], and Neisseria heparin binding antigen [NHBA]) to broaden the vaccine's protective coverage against various strains of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B.

So the question is : is there a temporary and partial reduction of mucosal immunity following administration of Bexsero vaccine? Should vaccinees limit exposure for a time frame after the vaccine or be administered a prophilactic antibiotic?

So my shot sticker person was very nice and walked me through the process. they told me to relax my arm and stuff since it would make it easier for me, the basic stuff. WHen they actually did it they warned me that it would hurt quite a bit, which was very true (first you get the needle which already hurts a good bit, and then you get the actual juice which hurts even worse). It wasn't unbearable but it was pretty painful. After I got it I was completely fine for about like 15 seconds before My vision started to get dark sort of swirly stripe blurs and I started feeling pretty light headed. This then made me freak the fuck out because I was thinking ""wow this should NOT be happening."" I started feeling kind of pukey and my hands had started to shake and get that prickly feeling when something like your arm or leg fall asleep. It got to the point where I had to lay down and drink like 50 of those teensy tiny paper cups of water they sometimes have.

Anyways, long story short, they said that usually people don't have reactions like that to the HPV vaccine (my sister did not when she got it, and neither did a few other people I know) BUT a small percentage of people do. They said what most likely my body just had a very strong reaction to the pain and I got really anxious which didn't allow me to breathe properly. They also said that the prickly feelings in my hands were because I was probably holding my breath as I got the shot without knowing it (and then had trouble breathing afterwards) which would also explain my lightheadedness and vision disruptions. I'm doing fine now with a sore arm a few hours after the fact but on the car ride home I felt like absolute dookie feces. Right now I'm just really tired lol. Anyways, I'm curious if anyone else who got the HPV vaccine experienced anything similar. Or, this can serve as a PSA to anyone who is planning to get it soon (reminder that this doesn't happen for everyone so you probably don't need to worry about it). Pretty scary 0/10 experience, but It will be worth it in the end though :,)",1e0z39l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1e0z39l/anyone_else_have_a_horrible_time_getting_the_hpv/,20

But I'm talking with my antivax mom, and she says she saw a vaccine where formaldehyde is the top ingredient. I'm trying to figure out where this particular thing came from or if it is just entirely fabricated. 

My understanding is that formaldehyde can be important in vaccines, which might be a reason why someone might say it's the ""top"" ingredient. Bit far fetched in my opinion, saying top ingredient implies to me that it is the ingredient in the highest amount, like how flour is the top ingredient in cake.

Context: my sister is anti-vax so her children never got the MMR vaccine. 
I had a baby two months ago and am nervous about him being around them because that vaccine isn't available until he's 1 and 1.5 years old.

The measles is coming back, in fact it's already where I live. Sadly, a 5 year old lost his life to it recently. I'm terrified for my son. 

My doctor advised to stay away from my sister and her children, but my question is can vaccinated children spread the measles to my son? He has other cousins that the sees regularly. 

Should I avoid everyone right now? How does it work? Is it only non-vaccinated people that spread it or are they just more affected by it?

I'm pulling this post over from a pregnancy subreddit I'm a part of because they seem to have an issue with asking questions about vaccines. Any information given respectfully would be greatly appreciated. 

""I have a question regarding the Hep B Vaccine (and similarly the erythromycin eye ointment given at birth). I'm not looking for a lecture, I'm genuinely just trying to make the best, most informed decision possible. I have and will continue putting in many hours of research on this and many more topics through the remainder of my pregnancy (and realistically probably forever because I stress over every little thing).

I will also be bringing this issue up with her pediatrician when the time comes.

I've been tested, and plan to be tested again for both hep b and gonorrhea, both of those tests have come back negative. My husband has also been tested and similarly came back negative. We are not at risk for contracting, or for our daughter to contract, hep b or gonorrhea.

So, my question is, **why is it recommended that my baby receive the hep b shot at birth, 2 months, and 6 months when she isn't at risk of contracting the virus?**

For a bit more context, in case it's relevant. We're a middle-class, Christian family. I'm not, nor have I ever been sexually promiscuous. My husband and I are in a loving, happy marriage, and we don't live in an area, nor do we plan to bring our daughter to an area we feel would put our family at risk of contracting the virus. Neither of us have ever had a blood transfusion, and I don't expect my daughter will be contracting any stds during her childhood.

The other risk factors I've found include ""sharing a needle or syringe with someone who has hepatitis B, using toothbrushes or razors exposed to blood that contains hepatitis B, receiving a tattoo or body piercing with unsterilized equipment, touching the blood of someone with hepatitis B when you have an open wound."" ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-do-you-get-hepatitis-b#short-answer))

None of which I feel my infant daughter is at risk for.

In addition, hep b cannot be transmitted through kissing, sneezing, or coughing.""

1. Conventional wisdom is to update the flu vaccine yearly, do I take  the Northern and Southern hemisphere formulation each time its  available, potentially getting two jabs a year;

3. When's the best time to get the flu jab if there is no specific flu season.     
 

If there are any questions or issues I didn't bring up because of my normie understanding of flu vaccinations, I'm all ears.

vaccines,,1712463777.0,PSA: Chikungunya vaccine apparently not available yet in US,"For anyone else who has been eagerly awaiting Ixchiq, the new chikungunya vaccine that was approved in the US a couple of months ago, an update. I was on a trip to the US last week, made an appointment with a travel clinic that claimed (on their web site) to have it. On the day of the appointment they called to inform me that they don't yet have it, and that it's likely to be 'a few more months' before any of their branches have it. I didn't have time to search more extensively, but they were of the strong opinion that no one else is likely to have it yet, either.

Disappointing news, especially because there hasn't been any news lately about the approval pipeline in other countries. But at least it may be on shelves in a few months in the US.

Also, for the pedants who responded to my previous post about this with the vitally important observation that this vaccine will be available through travel clinics, not pharmacies: I'm sure you will be overjoyed to learn that this was, indeed, a travel clinic, not a pharmacy.

vaccines,hawkins338,1712190007.0,Additional Covid Boosters,"TL;DR: Has anyone gotten more than 1 Covid booster a year due to immunosuppressants like Rinvoq?

I’m wondering if I should consider this because I’m on 30 mg of Rinvoq and am extra prone to Covid. 

I’ve gotten Covid 4x, once pre-vax that caused long covid, two of the times were during the summer (I get my boosters in the fall), and last time I caught it was only 4 months after an infection. I was also being super cautious most of those times (first one bc the vaccines weren’t out yet, other times in anticipation of a big event) and even with those precautions still caught it. 

The last two infections were very mild though, but I hate having to be so paranoid before events and such because of the longer incubation period and the fact I could spread it to someone who gets it severely (my severely immunocompromised uncle almost died from it). So I’d love to lower my overall risk of even catching it. Plus there’s a lot of studies about repeat infections that scare me a bit and I want to live my life without constant covid infections causing even more problems for my body. 

One of my docs said it’s a good idea, another said 2 probably won’t help more than just the one booster.

The cost for the test appears to be £250. But to actually just pay for these vaccines again is only £350 (possibly cheaper if I look around more) -- MMR, Chicken Pox, and Hepatitis B vaccines.

I've seen advice elsewhere saying that in some cases, you might as well just take the vaccine again rather than testing, if you're going to pay the money to test -- as, in this case, if I did need any of the vaccines, one course + the test = more than the overall sum of just getting all the vaccines in the first place.

Is that right? Is there any reason why I shouldn't just get an additional course for these various common vaccines now I'm approaching middle age, to top up immunity in case any of it has waned?

I got my second dose of the MMR just over an hour ago. Arm hurts a tiny bit but that’s it. But it has been a hell of a journey. 

I have been told that I did receive the first dose of this vaccine as a baby but due to a bad reaction, I didn’t receive the second dose. To this day, I do not know how bad the reaction was or when this reaction happened. My parents have been very tight lipped on it, especially my mother. 

When cases here started rising, I decided to look into getting a second dose, as I work in a university and live with immunocompromised people. I contacted my old and current GP to see if I could get a record of my first appointment. Nothing. My current GP wouldn’t even see me to discuss getting a second dose. I did manage to get some records from our health services, but again, there was nothing there. 

When asking my parents, my mother told me that after getting the first dose, I stopped meeting milestones, they were told I was slow and not developing properly and had to go to speech therapy. She blames the vaccine for it, because it was soon after I got the vaccine that this happened.  And again, she still didn’t tell me exactly what happened, just that I got really sick. 

Eventually, I got a second opinion from another doctor. He told me that considering that I have had multiple covid and flu vaccines, as well as 2 doses of the HPV vaccine last year with no side effects, that I should be fine. So I got it today after work. I was in and out in half an hour and I’m not dead. 

My mother is not happy about this but I don’t really blame her. I was vaccinated against everything else, it was only this booster I didn’t get.  The doctor told me yesterday that the MMR never caused a developmental delay but she doesn’t believe him. I wonder if I just got particularly bad side effects. 

Well, we will see what happens.  I was told by the vaccinator that this vaccine is very safe and effective. Wonder what side effects I’ll get. ",1bofx7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1bofx7w/just_got_2nd_dose_of_mmr_after_a_long_journey_of/,4

It's been applied mainly to AML but is being tried for a wide variety of indications. Was interested to hear what someone in the field thought. I don't know much about cancer vaccines, but as far as I understand it, only bacteria and virus based vaccines have been approved for use.

The short of it is that before we're born, we all express WT1 in kidney cells, but we no longer express this protein in normal cell function. However, cancerous cells of many types express WT1, so this vaccine is seeking it as an immunological target. 

They are specifically pairing the vaccine with existing treatments to get the best outcomes, and apparently it is showing marked improvements compared to the best available care strategies.",1bkx50k,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1bkx50k/galinpepimuts_a_novel_cancer_vaccine/,3

I switched pediatricians to a “regular” one which follows the CDC schedule (US) and they want to put my baby up to speed with his vaccines. My baby is about to be 4 months in about 2 weeks so my question is: can I go ahead and take him to get his 2 month shots this week and then get the second dosis in 2 weeks? Or should I go ahead and just get all the shots at his 4 month appointment and then at his 6 month appointment and so on? 

I’m just now worried about giving him the shots so close together.

Please don’t shame me about the delayed schedule and waiting to switch pediatricians for this long, I already feel bad about it and I’m just trying to fix the problem the best way possible. ",1b152n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1b152n4/how_to_best_catch_my_baby_up_to_his_vaccines/,7

vaccines,RenRen9000,1708271545.0,"Your Sunday Read: Yes, there are risks to the MMR vaccine, as there are for any medical intervention. But the risks are few, the benefits are huge, and most of the population trust the science of the vaccine. Don't let the loudmouth antivaxxers tell you otherwise.","The known risks of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine include both serious and non-serious adverse reactions, although serious reactions are rare.

### Serious Adverse Reactions
- **Anaphylaxis**: A severe allergic reaction that can occur after vaccination, but it is extremely rare.
- **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: This condition can occur within six weeks of immunization but is very rare[1].

### Non-Serious Adverse Reactions
- **Injection site reactions**: These include pain, redness, and swelling at the site of the injection. They are more common among adolescents (118.1 per 10,000 vaccinations) compared to adults[2].
- **Fever**: A common reaction that can occur after vaccination.
- **Rash**: Some individuals may develop a rash after receiving the vaccine.
- **Headache**: This is a reported non-serious adverse event that can occur post-vaccination.
- **Arthropathy**: Joint pain or swelling can occur but is generally non-serious.
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Swelling of the lymph nodes may be observed.
- **Parotitis**: Swelling of the parotid glands, similar to mumps, can occur.
- **Syncope**: Fainting episodes may happen after vaccination, often related to the act of injection rather than the vaccine itself.

### Frequency of Adverse Reactions
- Serious adverse reactions are very rare, with the incidence of validated serious outcomes ranging from 0 to 6.8 per 100,000 vaccinations[2].
- Non-serious adverse reactions vary in frequency, with the most common being arthropathy, injection site reaction, and rash. The incidence of medically-attended, clinically non-serious outcomes was ≤ 263 per 100,000 doses for each outcome assessed[3].

### Additional Considerations
- The MMR vaccine is generally considered safe and effective. The CDC states that two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps[4].
- The majority of the population, including parents with school-age children, believe the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks[5].

In conclusion, while there are known risks associated with the MMR vaccine, serious adverse reactions are rare, and the vaccine is considered safe for the vast majority of recipients. Non-serious reactions such as injection site reactions, fever, and rash are more common but are generally mild and resolve without long-term consequences.

vaccines,bri_guy_,1708014643.0,Struggling with Anti-Vax Family,"I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had to navigate this in recent years, but I'm struggling a bit to handle and navigate a family that has become increasingly anti-vax. I'll try to keep this post short, and I ask for supportive and helpful discourse. 

In short, my entire family has become vax-skeptical since COVID, with at least one of my siblings knowingly becoming anti-vax. Here are some things they have said/done to confirm that:

* When they recently had their first child, they refused to have a vitamin K shot administered to their child. I obviously wasn't in the room, but apparently, this caused a huge issue with the doctor. 
* They have sent me messages and ""studies"" that show the harm of metals (mercury, aluminum, etc.) being present in vaccines
* They claim that along with the rise in vaccines, there is a rise in childhood cancer, autism, autoimmune diseases, etc. 
* They essentially claim that natural solutions (herbs, whole foods, etc.) are more effective at treating diseases than vaccines. As an example, their child didn't get the RSV vaccine and was ""fine"" and they pointed at a couple of other kids of friends of theirs who were vaccinated and still had to be sent to the hospital (in reading, RSV vaccinations are about 80% effective in preventing hospitalization, and of course, saying ""look at what happened to this one person"" is anecdotal).
* Any claim I make about ""where are the studies showing these claims?"" is pushed back on and includes a response along the lines of ""Well, where are the studies *disproving* these claims?""

I've reached a point where I don't even want to spend the time trying to find resources to disprove their points, because if I sent something from the CDC, WHO, or any place or person that isn't independent, it's not legitimate in their eyes because these entities are apparently persuaded by other influences and are involved in or ignorant to some grand scheme. And, honestly, I have better things to do with my time.

I think what I'm looking for here is some help on:

* Finding legitimate resources that disprove these claims (harms of vitamin K shot, harm of metals being present in vaccines, any tie to things like autism, cancer, etc.)
* If anyone else has struggled with family who is anti-vax, and how you handled or are handling that
* And, what are the risks of being around an unvaccinated child? Are there risks for me as an adult? I'm also concerned about my future child potentially being around their unvaccinated children.

Honestly, I don't think I can do anything to change them, and am just going to draw a boundary to not have these conversations with them any longer, but there still is the concern about the safety of myself and my future children being around their children.

In a 2019 measles outbreak in Vancouver, Washington, the situation was dire, especially for kids like Kai, who couldn't be vaccinated due to chemotherapy. Despite CDC guidelines suggesting a 95% vaccination rate for safety, CBS News found over 8,500 schools below this threshold. Nationwide, vaccination rates are dropping, causing outbreaks in places like Philadelphia and Ohio. Experts emphasize the importance of herd immunity, which protects those who can't get vaccinated. NYC faced a similar crisis, leading to mandatory vaccinations and fines. Reasons for declining rates include political influences, misinformation, and mistrust in the government. Some states are combating this trend by eliminating exemptions and increasing public awareness.

vaccines,RosieRive123,1703949187.0,Current Covid Monovalent Booster and previous XBB.1.5 infection,"Hi folks. Getting vaccines updated, and came across an article from The NY Times about the current booster. According to this article:

“Data from a handful of academic labs suggests that patients infected with XBB.1.5 who had yet to receive the vaccine had developed enough neutralizing antibodies to “adequately handle” current versions of the virus, according to Dr. David Ho, a virologist at Columbia University. “We believe that would be equivalent to getting the XBB.1.5-based vaccine,” he said.” (The title of the article is “What to Know About the New Covid Shots,” by Knvul Sheikh, updated on October 23, 2023.)

Curious what others think about this take. 

I had Covid in LA in Jan 2023 and my husband got it in NY this past July. Our guess is that we likely had the “Kraken” variant - XBB.1.5 - since it was what was prevalent when we were each infected. (In case it matters: neither of us had been infected before - that we know about - and we had received all previous boosters.)

My understanding is that we then wouldn’t need to get this booster. (The shots usually make me ill, and I just had shingles in September, so would like not to take it if it’s redundant.)

To be clear - YAY vaccines, modern medicine, etc. ALL IN on that front. Not seeking medical advice, have an appointment with doctor scheduled. Still, would love to know others take on this.

vaccines,RenRen9000,1703801019.0,Flu shots in pregnancy protect infants from hospital visits,"Study: [Flu shots in pregnancy protect infants from hospital visits](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2023-2024/study-vaccination-6-months.htm)

A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics elaborates on how infants younger than six months, born to moms vaccinated against the flu during pregnancy, have a significantly lower risk of flu-related hospital visits. This is particularly critical, as infants can't get their own flu shot until six months. Here's the breakdown:

1. Flu vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of the flu in infants by a third.
2. The effectiveness of the maternal vaccine increases if the infant's disease severity rises - it reduces emergency visits by about 20% and hospitalizations by around 40%.
3. Younger infants (less than 3 months) have the highest protection - it reduces flu-related hospital visits by half.
4. Vaccine protection is more effective if given to mothers later in pregnancy.

This serves as a friendly reminder for any pregnant folks out there. The flu vaccine is safe for both you and your infant, and could significantly impact your child's protection against dangerous diseases.

To find out where you can get a flu shot, check out: [https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/](https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/)

Stay informed, stay safe! 

TLDR: Flu shots taken during pregnancy can save your infant from potential hospital visits up to six months after birth.

""The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has identified rabies in two stray kittens from North Conway, New Hampshire. DHHS is advising residents to avoid direct contact with any stray, feral, or wild animals, including cats and kittens, and exercise caution around unvaccinated pets, which can be infected with rabies by wild animals.

A concerned citizen picked up the first kitten with rabies and took it to the Conway Area Humane Society. Two veterinary practices cared for the kitten before it exhibited symptoms of rabies on November 11th and subsequently tested positive for rabies on November 13th. ...  A second kitten tested positive on November 16th and investigation is ongoing to identify people who may have been exposed. 

Rabies is a virus that impacts the brain and other parts of the central nervous system. It is transmitted when an infected animal’s saliva makes direct contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. This usually occurs when a person or pet is scratched or bitten by an infected animal. If a person or pet does not receive appropriate medical care after a rabies exposure, the virus can infect the brain, cause neurological symptoms, and ultimately lead to death. Human infections are extremely rare in the United States, and preventative treatment is recommended for people who have an exposure.

All dogs, cats, and ferrets should have up-to-date rabies vaccinations. It is also highly recommended that certain livestock species receive rabies vaccinations.",17xl83b,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/17xl83b/kittens_with_rabies_in_nh/,8

vaccines,casteelbrianna2002,1699638909.0,Vaccine Developments,"Firstly, I would just like to clarify that I am by no means an anti-vaxxer nor a science-denier. I got the COVID-19 shot and booster shot, but I have some doubts and would like to get them cleared up. Also, keep in mind that I know close to nothing of biology and chemistry (I have religiously avoided these subjects in school as much as possible) and so if any of the questions are stupid, feel free to tell me, but please try to do so kindly as I am asking purely out of curiosity and not at all out of malice.

I've been reading articles about the safety of vaccines and I've seen credible websites like the CDC and WHO assert the safety of vaccines. While I'm not denying their reliability, I also question whether these agencies will experience a change of heart in the coming years. The health industry in general is moving forward at a relatively fast pace, and furthermore, as a US citizen having witnessed prescription drug crises (fentanyl, opioids, etc.), I also tend to have some misgivings about the intentions of health insurance companies and the likes.

I got tired of googling and so, I came to you, r/VACCINES! I have a few questions and would appreciate if someone could link me articles or provide some answers:

* What is the process by which a vaccine is determined to be safe in the long term? Short term side effects can be determined in the process of testing, but how do they check whether they are safe in the long term (10 or 20 years down the line)?
* Are these private vaccine developer companies (primarily in the US) held to any real regulation by the government, or are they mostly functioning under the convenient cover of free-market capitalism?
   * In the same vein, are there any non-private vaccine developers?
* I've seen a lot of examples of speedy development in the health sector, and I wonder if there's any chance organizations rolling back on the statements they currently make about vaccines?
   * The flu itself changes yearly, and so does the vaccine. How do they know that the vaccine we took the previous year won't somehow interfere with this year's vaccine or something along those lines? (Not a biology person; of all my questions, this one sounds the stupidest)
* Particularly with regard to flu vaccines, a common argument people use is, ""Everyone I know who takes the flu vaccine regularly gets the flu regularly. I never have taken the vaccine and have never gotten the flu."" While I see the fallacious nature of this statement, I admit I am among those who never got the flu vaccine and have never gotten the flu, and I have friends who I was in contact with after they got the flu (who took the vaccine).

When removing other varibles like age and health issues, vaccinated people are much healthier. Then theres the problem with antivaxers cherrypicking when to value expert opinions.

antivax,Distinct_Thought_316,1754082060.0,Should doctors need parental consent to vaccinate?,"**Disclaimer: I’m using the word parent here as a catch-all for anyone with legal authority over the minor, whether that’s a parent, guardian, or another legal caregiver. Just simplifying the wording for clarity.**


I’ve just been thinking about how stupid it is that doctors can’t vaccinate minors without parental consent, especially when the only reason for turning down lifesaving medicine is that the parent doesn’t “believe” in vaccines.

And like, if one parent refuses, the doctor should be allowed to contact the other parent (if they’re in the picture) or another legal guardian. Someone, anyone, who can take responsibility for that child’s well-being should have the power to say yes to basic medical care. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, whoever. 

It just shouldn’t end with one stubborn, misinformed adult saying no.

If the parent is simply uneducated or misinformed, ok. Educate them. Give them the facts. Answer their questions. Point them to the science.

I don’t have a problem with people who just don’t know better, as long as they’re willing to listen to the person who does. 

You know… the one who spent years studying medicine and actually knows what they’re talking about. 

The one with the piece of paper that literally says, “I know better than you about medicine.” 

But if they refuse to be educated or still refuse to vaccinate no matter what they’re told, then not ignorance anymore. That’s being a selfish, cruel piece of shit. 

This isn’t a “personal preference.” It’s not a harmless belief.

It’s medical neglect.

It’s selfish.

It’s abusive.

Yes, I understand that doctors legally need parental consent to treat minors in most cases, and I support that law. 

It exists for a reason. 

It protects families and kids. 

I’m generally all for the idea that “parents get the final say.”

But this is different.

Not vaccinating your child exposes them to deadly, preventable diseases. And it puts others at risk cause it only takes one infected kid to shut down an entire school or get others sick. 

If you seriously think your overpriced essential oils from Susan’s MLM are better than life saving medicine backed by decades of scientific research, you shouldn’t be making medical decisions for a child.

You’re not fit to make those decisions.

It stops being a “personal choice” the moment it puts your child and others in danger. That’s exactly when the law should step in, when the consequences go beyond yourself.

I’m not sure how I feel about this in the case of unvaccinated adults.

I don’t have a strong stance there yet. 

But when it comes to kids? 

That’s where my focus and frustration lie. 

And just to be clear: I’m not talking about valid medical exemptions. Those matter and should be honored. 

But when the only thing stopping you from protecting your child is some stupid belief or internet fueled delusion?

That’s where I have a serious problem.

I genuinely wish doctors had more authority to protect these kids cause clearly their parents aren’t doing their jobs. 

At the very least, this should be something CPS can investigate. I know CPS (at least in the U.S.) is horrifically underfunded and flawed.

Yes, there’s always a risk of things going sideways there, but doing nothing just lets the abuse continue.

It reminds me of that Family Guy episode where Lois and Peter kidnap a child with cancer because the parents think “thoughts and prayers” are better than chemotherapy.

No, kidnapping a child isn’t okay, but in their defense (and this is from someone who hates Lois and Peter) they were just trying to get the kid to the hospital.

I’m not saying people should break the law or take matters into their own hands like that. But if there were actual legal protections in place to prevent this kind of medical neglect, maybe people wouldn’t feel like they had to.

Yeah, using an adult cartoon to back my claim isn’t the best form of argument but stuff like this does happen like that boy who had to sneak his siblings out to get vaccinated. 

So stuff like this does happen. 

Curious how others feel about this, from a legal, ethical, or just basic human decency standpoint.

Maybe I live in some fantasy world and all of this is just an unrealistic dream. But I just feel horrible for these kids. ",1mf8578,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/1mf8578/should_doctors_need_parental_consent_to_vaccinate/,5

antivax,Reasonable_Ad_2936,1752455463.0,A poignant story,"Today I ran across this…

""Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.
'Are you feeling all right?' I asked her.
'I feel all sleepy,' she said.
In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.
The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.
On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunized against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it....
Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was ‘James and the Giant Peach‘. That was when she was still alive. The second was ‘The BFG‘, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children."" -- Roald Dahl

Roald Dahl, the beloved author of classic children's books such as ""Matilda"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" lost his daughter to measles in 1962.

antivax,ra-ra-rasputin1988,1745187934.0,I sure didn't expect this when I watched a YouTube video about Right Said Fred,"Right, some quick context: I recently had this YouTuber called 6u66blegun come up in my recommendations - he seems to have only started at the start of 2025, but has done a lot of short multi-part video essays every week on British music stars/groups that expose the seedy underbelly of the pop industry. Videos with titles like ""The Dark Side of Simon Cowell Part 2"" and ""The Dark Side of [Black Lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lace#Chart_success_(1981%E2%80%931987)) Part 3"", stuff like that. I was really starting to get into his work, as the videos were engaging, well-made and seemed to be properly researched... then on Good Friday he puts out a short video essay on Right Said Fred (I'm not including a link, even to a proxy site, to stay on the safe side of Rule 2)

Now, you'd think that, given his whole shtick of looking into pop stars getting mired in scandal, he'd maybe mention stuff like them [being antivaxxers even after getting Covid](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/right-said-fred-richard-fairbrass-covid-b1906302.html), or [promoting neo-Nazi streamers because they agree with the brothers' stance on the vaccine](https://eoinhiggins.substack.com/p/reich-said-fred-uk-band-turned-anti). Instead, it focuses entirely on some innocuous fib they told journalists about being session musicians for David Bowie, Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones, painting the two as lovable rogues who are a bit embarrassed about telling porkies all those years ago.

I've only been watching his videos for a while, but I know he likes to do plenty of research and hasn't hesitated to put the boot into other novelty pop acts. So I looked into the comments section to try and make sense of things and... well, you can see my screencaps. There's more, but it's mostly just your usual alt-shite persecution complex bollocks. I'm also 90% sure he's been deleting comments I posted that mention the aforementioned neo-Nazi streamers, so that's something to bear in mind. Another point of interest is that he doesn't seem to have any social media presence - no Twitter, no Facebook, no nothing. The cynic in me thinks he knew that he'd eventually go mask off, and made sure he didn't give anyone a platform to cancel him on.

I dunno, I guess I just needed to vent. I'm no stranger to finding out a YouTube channel I find interesting is run by some chud in sheep's clothing, but it's been a while since I was so thoroughly fooled. I'd like to think that going mask off this hard will tank his views/subscriptions, but I'm not holding my breath.

I don't think I broke any rules (I figured being overly cautious was better than not being cautious at all) but if I have then I'd appreciate it if the mods let me know.",1k3y7gv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3y7gv,7

Mennonite parents still anti-vaxxers, say measles isn’t that bad because only one  of their five children died from it, tell others not to vaccinate.","”“Don’t do the shots,” the girl’s mother said. Measles, she added, is “not as bad as they’re making it out to be.” She noted that her four other children all recovered after having received alternative treatments from an anti-vaccine doctor, including cod liver oil, a source of vitamin A, and budesonide, an inhaled steroid usually used for asthma.  

“Also, the measles are good for the body,” the girl’s father said, adding through an interpreter of Low German that measles boosts the immune system and wards against cancer — an untrue supposition often offered by anti-vaccine groups and repeated recently by [Robert F.] Kennedy [Jr.].

Without evidence, influencers at Children’s Health Defense and beyond have reframed the tragedy of the girl’s death as proof — of the efficacy of unproven cures like vitamin A, of maltreatment by a hospital and even of a plot to undermine Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services.”

antivax,chance_of_downwind,1743189609.0,"What's the big play? ""Cui bono""? What are the economics of ""anti-vax""?","Hey, 

This is more of a shower thought, but being that I am not a scientist, and generally unfamiliar with the topic: 

What are the power dynamics surrounding the ""antivax"" movement? 

Like, there are people who evidently are making it part of their business to disrupt, deny, or destroy the current worldwide system of vaccine-basedhealthcare. What is even happening, there?

Sure, there might be some fanatics. But assuming - **assuming** \- that not all of them are nutjobs or dunces that have miraculously managed to consistently fail upwards and recruit a devout following - what's the economic goal, and what would be the incentive to spread ""anti-vax"" ideas?   
  
Is this just ""anti-system propaganda""? Is this about ""my product over yours""? 

Like, my deal is politics and the economy. I can see how non-Democratic powers would benefit from creating a long-term weakness especially for North America. I can see how triggering more-than-average dissent over the pandemic - or future pandemic - would be within the interest of peer or near-peer antagonistic forces.

...But, really, taking into consideration any economic, demographic, or, in the broadest sense, geo-political predictive data that we have, this again seems to push me into tinfoil hat territory: The butterfly effect of bringing, say, polio back, would potentially be disruptive on a level like we have not seen since the Black Plague. Why would anyone risk that if it's a power play/gaining territory/gaining influence/gaining wealth, in the most general sense?

I’ve seen scary YouTube’s of people saying a vaccine paralyzed them. But then I know that the vast majority of people are vaccinated and it’s the only reason we’ve eradicated deadly diseases. Vaccines have literally saved people by the millions, including those like me who grew up without them, thanks to herd immunity. So I know it’s the right decision just need to hear that it’s not going to harm me. Also… I know I gotta get the measles vaccine first since people are getting that.

Also, as an adult do I need to get the polio vaccine?

And I’m in no way antivax… literally myself and millions would be dead if it wasn’t for the responsible parents who did get everyone vaccinated when this modern day fucking miracle became available to us.

I've been doing some research on the use of aluminum compounds as adjuvants in vaccines, which have been in-use for over 70 years. I keep hearing from various sources that these vaccines are safe, but I'm struggling to find the original safety studies that justified their widespread use. 

For instance, I came across the 1969 Butler study, but it didn't involve any long-term monitoring. Then there's the 1997 Flarend study, which only involved three white rabbits, monitored for 28 days, and still yielded inconclusive results. More recent studies like Keith and Mitkus, while interesting, don't seem to address the initial safety concerns before aluminum adjuvants were introduced into vaccines. There also seem to be some issues with those studies (though not the point of this post). 

I'm genuinely curious - am I missing something here? Where are the in-depth, long-term studies that conclusively show these aluminum adjuvants are safe? If anyone has links or references to these studies, I'd really appreciate it. I'm not here to argue, just to learn and understand better.

I also don't think that they cause autism. I have autism myself, but I'm of the belief that it has nothing to do with vaccines.


I also want to say that if you don't want to get vaccinated, you don't have to. I myself am skeptical of the COVID vaccine because I don't think it was that effective as a preventer of the virus. I do stand to be corrected, though, and wish for it to happen.


I also understand that those in the pro life camp have issues with some of the vaccines. From what I understand, some of the vaccines were researched on stem cells from fetuses. Is this true? Is there some truth to it?


My main goal, besides my inquiries being answered, is to gain understanding into the reasons an antivaxxer has for their beliefs.

I hope this sub won't delete the post as well, because I'm genuinely curious about the topic of vaccine shedding.

So yeah, here it is. I'm looking forward to you guys' opinions.

- - -

I'm a pro-vaxxer and biology student (3rd semester).

I have no doubts about the effectiveness of covid vaccines, although I have to admit that the way politicians handled the topic during the pandemic was problematic to say the least. Absolute claims like ""If you don't get vaxxed, you'll definitely get covid"" and vice versa, are unscientific and harmful to society.

After we got that out of the way, here is what I want to know from antivaxxers/vaccine-sceptics:

We all know the term ""vaccine shedding"". People who use it, imply, that it is somehow possible to ""shed"" the spike protein after its synthesis got initiated by the RNA blueprint in covid vaccines. In other words: Vaccinated people can somehow shed the spike-protein to other people.

Now, here's my problem: How is this supposed to work?

I think we can all agree on how the mechanism of mRNA vaccines works:

The vaccine contains a RNA blueprint encapsulated in nanolipids. After vaccination, the RNA enters your cell's cytosol, where it then connects to a ribosome. This ribosome then reads the genetic information from the RNA strain and initiates the proteinbiosynthesis of the isolated spike-protein, which is normally found on the surface of SC2s viral body. SC2 uses those proteins to hijack host cells with ACE2 surface receptors.

Now, because the spike-protein has no relevant functionality without the rest of the viral structure and because it's already located inside of the cell after being synthesized, there is no reason to assume any relevant complications may arise after vaccination.

There is also no reason to assume that it's somehow possible for the spike-protein to infect other people. This would require the protein to somehow leave your cells and get transmitted to another person.

And even if that would happen: What damage could the spike-protein cause without the rest of the viral structure? It would enter your cells by hijacking the ACE2 surface receptors - fine. And then? It would immeadiatly get recognized and neutralized by your immune system, just like after vaccination.

So yeah, I would appreciate some scientific input regarding this topic. I'm not making this post in bad faith. It's always possible to miss new scientific data.",1fqtuix,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/1fqtuix/someone_explain_vaccineshedding_to_me_deleted_2/,17

I am completely (but ignorantly) pro-vaccine. I have no medical knowledge and trust my children’s doctors, so I have never questioned vaccines before. 

I learned earlier this summer that a new friend of mine (I don’t have many friends) doesn’t vaccinate. She seems so down to earth, and is the first good friend I have made in a decade. She has sent me a few things and echos what I constantly hear “do the research and pick what’s best for your family”. I also live in a pretty conservative area and have seen recently that the majority of people in mom groups on various social platforms are strongly antivax. Like 9/10 moms. They have lots of links, and very scary info. Not sure if it is because I have looked at these links or what not but when I google vaccine research, particularly Covid vaccine research, most articles I read lean antivax unless government funded. 

I know vaccines have saved so many people. I know I strongly believe they are safe and effective but I have  hardly any evidence to back up my opinion. 

I’m not asking for you to do my research for me, just for help. So for those of you that have done your research where did you start? How did you know who to trust?

antivax,G1G1G1G1G1G1G,1710510558.0,Learning about this debate of vax or anti,"Hello, I’m someone who hasn’t really thought much about to vax or not to vax. Covid vaccines are the only ones we’ve taken and now that things have mostly gone the way of the flu we don’t bother taking it as we’ve just never really cared to take a vaccine unless it was a big threat like covid. However I have a relative thats very against vaccines (all not just covid) and this has got me researching just how this all works. So I hope this is a place I can ask questions to get pointed to the right info…

1. It seems the process is this…vaccines go through phase 1-4 testing, which is basically larger and larger samples groups, after a company has experimented with using some sort of compound (typically coming from the targeted virus itself) and found it may invoke an immune response in people. Depending on the findings they progress through the phases after FDA approval at each stage. 

2. Those tests/studies are available for researchers and people in the medical field to read. But they are not available to the general public. 

3. Pharma companies are private owned (private or public but I mean not a government agency) and FDA and CDC are government run. 

4. In order to have tests done a pharma company would pay the FDA for testing for their test results to be reviewed and either approved or denied. 

5. Once approved by the FDA, it is now ready to make for the public. Now its onto the GP. Do GP doctors read trials since they are medical pros and have access to trial data? Or do they just trust the FDA?

So that seems to be the process…is that correct? 

Then onto some of the arguments against taking vaccines that is being said….

1. Pharma companies do not actually have data for trials and have not conducted these trials. So any truth to that? How can I confirm or deny this if I don’t have access. For this argument I hope my GP does have access and has read them before administering vaccines because otherwise its an unfalsifiable claim. 

2. There are studies that link vaccines to autism and many other issues. The irony of both denying ‘studies’ while claiming ‘studies’ but anyway for those of you who might agree, where might I find such study and how would I go about validating one study while invalidating another? As a lay person I feel left to simply google and one thing I was googling was the claim that there is no autism in Amish people groups. Google returned links to claims of this sort and many others also claiming studies done show Amish are actually mostly vaccinated and there indeed is autism and all the other things that vaccines are claimed to cause…however where is the study for me to review? It seems very common to simply claim a study was done with no link or reference to a source we all agree are in fact the studies. 

3. Those are the two main objections other than getting into conflict of interest and how the world is personally conspiring against you and its all tied to following the money! We can leave that alone but it does have the elements of paranoia involved when my relatives start expressing these kind of ideas. 

Hopefully I explained what my ultimate questions are here but if anything, the main question is how does someone like me that has no background professionally or out of interest in medical science go about confirming or denying these various claims? 

Thanks.

antivax,Daily_Burnin12345,1710364306.0,Dangerous Antivax Misinformation: Ex-Nurse's Latest Post on Measles Remedies,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I stumbled upon a concerning post by Kristen Nagle on Instagram, and I felt the need to share it here, especially in a community that values science and vaccination. Kristen Nagle is known for sharing dangerous antivaccine misinformation, and her recent post about natural remedies for measles is downright alarming.

&#x200B;

In her post, Nagle describes measles as a ""benign childhood illness"" and encourages parents to avoid vaccination, claiming that measles is a ""rite of passage"" that actually benefits children by boosting their immune system and detoxing their bodies. This couldn't be further from the truth. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death, particularly in vulnerable populations such as infants and immunocompromised individuals.

&#x200B;

What's even more concerning is Nagle's promotion of so-called ""natural remedies"" for measles, which are not only ineffective but also potentially harmful. She suggests using fermented cod liver oil, catnip, lavender and peppermint oil, oat baths, and various herbs as treatments for measles symptoms. Not only are these remedies unproven, but they can also delay proper medical care and put children at risk of complications.

&#x200B;

I urge everyone to be cautious of misinformation like this and to report accounts that spread antivaccine propaganda. Nagle's Instagram account is a prime example of such harmful content, and it's important that we take action to prevent the spread of dangerous misinformation.

&#x200B;

If you come across Nagle's account or similar accounts promoting antivaccine rhetoric, please consider reporting them to Instagram. We need to work together to ensure that accurate information about vaccines and infectious diseases is accessible to everyone.

&#x200B;

Stay informed, stay safe, and let's continue to advocate for science-based healthcare practices.

&#x200B;

(Note: I intentionally omitted Nagle's Instagram handle to avoid directly promoting her account, but if you're interested in reporting it, you can search for her name on Instagram.)",1be2yji,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/1be2yji/dangerous_antivax_misinformation_exnurses_latest/,12

Ever since covid started I have become extremely vaccine hesitant. I delayed getting the c19 vax and only ended up getting a single dose.
My husband and I started trying for a baby and we’re told by doctor to get vaccinated for rubella. I did with no hesitation.
I also got tdap while pregnant with no hesitation. 

I don’t know what on earth has happened to me but I am LITREALLY petrified of vaccinating my baby. I refused the hep b at birth and only gave baby vitamin k. 

After a lot of convincing and reassurance from my mum I gave her the scheduled 2 month dose but not she’s almost 5 months and I haven’t taken her back for the next dose.

I just keep seeing videos of babies dying of SIDS days after their vaccination or the other day I saw a video of a baby girl that died of cardiac arrest at 15 months old within 24hours of getting vaccinated. 

I’m an absolute wreck, I keep having this mental debate whether I should or should vaccinate her further. It’s all I can think about and it’s taking over my life 🙁

Don’t worry I don’t believe the whole autism bs it’s more the other things I’ve mentioned.
Aluminium adjuvants that are neurotoxic etc etc
I even considered vaccinating her with the vaccines that don’t have the aluminium adjuvants. 

I’m just rambling now. I’m really desperate for some reassurance and rationale as I’m feeling extremely anxious and vulnerable.

Her ex-partner is anti-vax and has convinced her or this. We're both at least nominally skeptical of government, but for differing reasons.

I am pro science and pro vaccine. I argued that there is independently verifiable evidence that vaccines work, that the evidence is out there if she were to look. That she needn't look for sources that come from states or ""big pharma"" (I argue that states and big pharma are a barrier to vaccine distribution and don't effectively combat disinformation)...

... that whilst we should be criticalof states a big companies, we should do so based on facts. The worldview in which all states have miraculously collaborated to pull a fast-one over the millions of independent scientists and medical institutions, who can independently verify their claims, that we have seen a massive fall in preventable ilnesses through vaccines, that governments have toppled etc. since the discovery of vaccines, for this to be a big ""lie"" would require such a distorted worldview as to be nonsensical. Basically the argument that governments aren't all powerful to pull such far-reaching conspiracies that could be disproven at such low-cost to an individual.

I didn't have any better arguments to hand off the top of my head. I reminded her that her ex-partner also believes a lot of different bullshit which she has since changed her mind on/disgreed with throughout. That seemed to sway her, and she seems more ""agnostic.""

But I was listening to a really smart man on YouTube about his experience with vaccines and their horrors. He had a tip for preventing covid ""infections"" which I think is worth a try.

Basically, it involves electricity. Pharma doesn't want you to know how easily such a seemingly-unrelated form of science can zap away not only viruses, but various nut allergies caused by vaccines. Essentially all you need is a fork and an electrical outlet (like the ones in your house.) Simply take your metal fork and place it directly into the outlet. Almost instantly you can feel the germs burn away; the electrical current creates a shield around you protecting you from the scamdemics. Pharma and Fauci don't want you to know this, but if they say anything at all then it's *obviously* a lie.

Over the past couple years I have wanted to get vaccinated, and now that I am an adult, I have the chance to do so. However, I realized that I am really scared of it because of the way I was raised. When you have never had a certain procedure done in your entire memory AND you have always been discouraged and told scary things about vaccines by your own mother (vaccines causing inflammation, disabling side effects, etc), it has quite the effect on the psyche. I am scared that I'll have an allergic reaction or some really bad side effects if I get a vaccine. It doesn't help at all that I have struggled with health anxiety before, so I'll probably be really worried the entire time, which could even mimic or exacerbate side effects. I also don't really have people to support me in this except my grandma who lives across the country, so I'll be all alone...

Has anyone ever had similar experiences and if so, how'd you deal with it? And if anyone has any recommendations for how I can become calmer and less skeptical/afraid about it, I am open to listening.

antivax,SpacePigeonStudiosOG,1682523551.0,Antivaxxer aunt's fearmongering,"This happened in the middle of the year 2020 but it still bothers me, to this day. 

So I have this ‘aunt’, not blood related, she’s an ex of one of my grandparents. They broke up 20 years ago. She still thinks she can assert some authority over all the grandchildren. She inserts unsolicited opinions about lives and choices and nitpicks everything. My sister and her boyfriend hadn’t really made their mind up about the vaccine, except for: “hey, if it works we can go party again safely!” That is until our ‘lovely aunt’ imposed some *priceless advice* about the vaccine.

My sister and her boyfriend, my girlfriend and I, met up in early 2020, to exchange some late Christmas gifts. Of course outside, wearing masks and keeping a safe distance. All is well until the vaccine gets brought up, my girlfriend has been very excited about it, she couldn’t wait until the world returned to normal.

My sister starts anxiously telling us that we should not get the vaccine because she heard some terrible things about it. Curious, we want to know the details. She starts telling us how in the 60’s there was this injection that doctors gave to pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness. Their babies were born with no arms and no legs! She tells us our aunt has told her and her boyfriend all of this. Aunt convinced them not to take the vaccine. Because who knows, maybe this vaccine can also cause the same side effects! There is not a chance in hell her boyfriend and her are taking this vaccine. Not only that but now they want to convince *us* not to take the vaccine either.

My girlfriend recognises this story. She tells them this doesn’t make any sense because thalidomide, that’s the injection they are talking about, was not a vaccine but a medicine. They sold this medicine in the 50’s and it was removed from the market in 1960 or something. She assures them that no vaccines have ever had such extreme side effects and that medicine development and production is quite different now in 2020 than it was in the 50’s. My sister and boyfriend are not reassured and now, they completely refuse to get vaccinated. They would like to start a family and are horrified one of their children could be born like that.

It took me a lot of convincing for my sister to still get the vaccine, her boyfriend was harder to convince and I to this day don’t know if they had had their repeat shots.

So my girlfriend and I got the vaccine in early June of 2020. I sent my aunt a message saying I got the astrazeneca vaccine because I was very happy with it. She sent me a message back that she had also had the same vaccine 2 months ago. What. I showed the message to my girlfriend. She blocked aunt on her phone immediately. She was waiting for the last drop with this aunt and this was it. I went no contact too some time later.

For her 5 seconds of enjoying asserting authority over people and commanding them what to do, she could have endangered my sister’s and her boyfriend's lives. Or caused at least some serious damage to their health.

Spicy details: aunt has a degree in sports science, she graduated in the 80’s. She often flaunts this degree, a lot of my family members didn’t even finish high school so this was impressive for them. They saw aunt as an authority. 

In the 80’s it was already widely known that some medicines with cis and trans molecules can have vastly different effects. And that for some you should only use cis or trans or disasters could happen. Aunt must have seen this case in her classes, I don’t think this is something one just forgets.

Aunt has forgotten that my girlfriend also had biochemistry 1 in university. There was absolutely no way she could convince us to not take the vaccine.

Aunt would convince others not to take it but she would of course take it for herself.

How can people be like that? This is so deeply evil, toying around with people’s health and even lives just to feel some power over them. I wonder how many others she had tried to convince.",12zlnu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/12zlnu8/antivaxxer_aunts_fearmongering/,2

antivax,Voices4Vaccines,1680345837.0,'No Fault' Compensation for Vaccine Injury Claims," I saw this post earlier today. And it's a question I hear often about vaccines, so I wanted to address it. 

https://preview.redd.it/vxh2rvp859ra1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d28d988e1242ec138e528cdfd9bf255b68c4aa

The reason we use a no-fault compensation system is because the standard legal process lead to bad outcomes for everyone (including plaintiffs).

US courts are not reliable adjudicators of medical claims--judges and lawyers aren't doctors--so what would happen is the large majority of people suing would lose their case, after years of expensive legal struggles, and the people who won did so more by luck and legal opinion than by having a more valid medical claim than other plaintiffs.

Likewise: vaccines also aren't a huge profit center for pharma (vs other drugs) so many companies pulled out of the market rather than deal with the randomness. This literally lead to vaccine shortages in the 80s. So not only were very few people compensated under this system, but also people who wanted to get vaccinated could not.

The no-fault system was a policy solution that made it easier for individuals claiming to be vaccine injured to get compensation, by lowering the standard of evidence necessary. And to be clear: *you can sue the pharmaceutical company* *if you lose your case here.* It's just that most people who go through this system don't.

It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative.

My sister came into town, she is unvaxxed and convinced that her natural immunities can take care of anything. My mom was begging me to come over and see her. This was a very hard no. My mom is convinced that I am over reacting. I sent her a bunch of articles about what the rest of the rational world already knows. She told me that you cant trust medical facilities, because they are a business making a profit. And they want to push vaccines to make $. COVID VACCINES ARE FREE TO THE PUBLIC. I LITERALLY work in medical billing, so I know how hospitals made money from medical incidents and claims, and billing the patient is the last thing that we want to do.

1. Its completely biased and purely anti-vaccine, they don't even take a centered approach.
2. The information is cherry picked from FDA, CDC, WHO, etc, and crops only what they want you to focus on, despite putting the source from where they cherry picked from.
3. Misleading engineered questions after each insert snippet, which can only be answered narrowly, being that the answer HAS TO BE negative instead of open-ended.
4. The information of who is running the site isn't present at all and we have no idea of who they are, what their educational background is and if their information is approved by a credible reviewer.
5. The site doesn't contain any actual raw informational text, every info doc is listed as a pdf which leads me to believe that, possibly they are avoiding web crawlers to fact check their information.
6. Anti-mask rhetoric and research, to fully round out the anti-science community's trifecta.
7. A merchandise shop to purchase your own ""informed-consent"" t-shirts on bonfire 🙃

I'm 17, living in Mississippi. My parents are very skeptical about the vaccine. They aren't pro-qanon or conspiracy theorists, but rather skeptical about safety because covid-19 vaccines were developed in only a year, the long term effects are unknown, and that mRNA vaccines are a new thing. However, they are convinced that covid vaccines increase the risk of HIV, liver damage, etc.

We all got COVID in November 2020. There wasn't really much we could do, we wore masks when in public places, but the curve was rising.

Now, fast forward to July 2021. This was during the delta variant surge. My older sister got vaccinated and my parents got kind of mad, but they later forgave her since she's 20. We all tested positive, except my sister who lives with us. My mom who is a former smoker, had difficulty breathing and had to go to the hospital. She's fine now, but I don't remember how much, but the bill was expensive. But, the fact that my sister didn't get covid barely helped convince my parents that vaccines work.

Mississippi isn't very great with vaccination rates or masking preference.

Disease is the tipping point when your immune system must use a more specific and unprecedented cascade of events in order to deal with an invader. When you are exposed to a new disease, your body will try to use it's front line soldiers; neutrophils and macrophages, but they are not very good or have the ability to specifically target without training. With extensive training, they are the super soldiers of your body.


If you have no prior experience with a specific pathogen, your body has no way of specifically knowing how to fight it, even if you have a great immune system. If you do have prior experience with it, your body uses antibodies created from T Cells that fought in the previous incursions which are specifically known as a Memory T Cell. When your body has fought in a previous battle, some of the T Cells that helped create the original antibodies during that battle, will revert into a passive state, almost sentry-like. They will hang around all over your body, waiting to be activated by antigens (body parts) of the matching destroyed pathogen it was created to defend against.


*If you do not already have these Memory T Cells from a previous infection, the process of creating that weapon system from scratch can be very taxing and damaging to your own body which is what we would refer to as ""disease"". It can be especially draining while it is also trying to fight off the pathogen with the untrained front liners. Too much happening at one time. Again, it is not the pathogen doing direct damage to you.*


Think of it like bombing your own city that as a couple terrorists in it while also trying to figure out how to pinpoint them more specifically. It would obviously be better to rely on a more specific game plan than bombing your own city. But this is just the cycle your body goes through with every new pathogen. Sometimes it's an easier process, sometimes not.


A more specific look at some of the things that are happening that is very exhausting and damaging to your body would be;


* The discovery and activation of higher order immune cells other than your first contact cells.

* Gathering of antigens (pathogenic body parts) by dendritic cells (scout cells that collect said body parts to deliver to your lymph nodes and thymus gland)

* Production and training of T and B Cells.

* Opsonizing pathogens (covering of invaders with antibodies and proteins to make them easier to spot for your the rest of your immune system).

* And most of all, the indiscriminate attack of said pathogens via unfocused neutrophils and macrophages that leads to the reckless killing of your own cells as well as the pathogens, all while a more specific plan is in the works.h


It is not until your body creates a specific defense plan against that specific pathogen, will your body also be able to defend against said pathogen more discriminately and faster which no longer wastes energy that ends up damaging your body. 


*This is what is known as protection, immunity and lessening of the disease.*


You can still be ""infected"", which is an unrealistic and ignorant expectation to have for the way in which a vaccine works. Building higher and higher castle walls does not stop invaders from trying, but it will stop them from doing any real damage. They are still ""infecting"" your lands outside the castle walls but they are dealt with much easier if you have proper defenses. If your body has a specific defense plan already in place from past exposure to either the actual virus or a vaccine, you will most likely not conventionally get what is known as ""the disease"", because your body does not have to go through that arduous, dangerous and expensive process of creating a defense system anymore. Because your body already has a plan stored in it's Memory T Cells, it will be much easier to keep that pathogen under control if it ever shows up again which prevents ""the disease"", but not infection. The only way to prevent infection is to limit your exposure to potential physical encounters with that pathogen, but as mentioned before, if you already had a battle plan ready (immunity), you do not have to usually worry about being dramatically careful about exposure. Stay out of mud pits but you don't need to be in a bubble eithwr. Being infectedbis no big deal if you know how to deal with it. Obviously don't make your body fight extra battles, but that is the main difference here between infection and a disease.


Research and Development is very costly for your body to go through. If someone could just give your body the proper technology and building techniques, that would save so much time. You would be able to attack the pathogen much more directly and immediately before it reaches that tipping point, again, which is what is known as ""the disease"". The reaction you get from the vaccine provides a very similar defense plan, without the exhausting and self-harming effects associated with naturally acquiring that immunity.


*If both the vaccine and exposure to the actual virus provide a ""bullet proof vest"", having a vest does not stop bullets from firing from guns, but it is more wise to not have to shoot yourself in the foot first in order to ""naturally"" get the vest.*


There are 3 major vaccines types we have here; activated, deactivated and mRNA. These are all ways that your body is shown antigens (pathogenic body parts) in order to create this immune response which will lead to an overall immunity.


* Activated is alive but a weakened form of the virus that must be farmed in petri dishes or some other substrate. This process is very slow and can sometimes create a strong immune response since your immune system can get a ""real"" look at a somewhat functioning virus but it can also be more taxing, depending on the pathogen. This is a better option for some situations but not for all. Continued infection is possible but usually very limited as the initial pathogens in the vaccine are massively crippled and have a hard time connecting to other cells in order to replicate.

* Deactivated is a somewhat similar method as activated, as in it contains actual parts of the pathogen, but they have been ""blended"" which poses no actual threat of replication as the antigens are thrown all over the place. You need a complete cell, not just the protein receptors of a pathogen, in order to have continued infection. Typically your body just only needs access to the receptors of the pathogen in order to recognize them and create an immune response which leads to immunity. Think of receptors as a lock and key mechanism yhay cells like T and B cells are specifically created to learn how to recognize. This is the way your cells also physically connect to other cells. If the receptors match, it's like the correct key for the lock. These vaccines also need to be farmed just like the activated ones. They tend to produce a decent response but also stand no chance of replication at all as there are no complete pathogens that can replicate. This style of vaccine is also somewhat fragile as the parts tend to degrade faster than activated since they're already dismantled and on their way to decay. 

* mRNA is wholly unique in that it does not deliver the virus at all. As mentioned before, your immune system mainly uses the receptors (lock and key) to recognize what the pathogen is. That is the only part that is necessary in order to create an immune response. Everything else is unnecessary in recognizing a threat. Viruses specifically work by randomly crashing into one of our cells, uploading the entirety of its DNA or RNA, which hijacks our own cell machinery, forcing it to create more of the virus. They need our own cells to replicate. Bacteria though, simply eat our cells and use the energy to divide all on their own with their own machinery. This production of new cells is also something that happens normally but usually only happens by your own body using this feature. The act of using your cell's machinery to create things is not the issue, but what exactly it is forced to create, could be the real problem. 


Having a factory that creates 'turkey sandwiches' is not a problem. It is only when that factory is forced to produce 'poisonous BLT sandwiches' is when it becomes an issue. The mRNA vaccine is a way to tell our own machinery to instead, only create just the bacon part of the BLT. It is absolutely harmless without the other ingredients and there is no data contained within the vaccine that produces anything other than the ""bacon"". The bacon here is simply the ""lock and key"" receptor spike proteins. Without a virus body attached to these spike proteins, there is zero chance of replication of the virus. Having your body create these proteins itself means that we do not have to wait for entire viruses to be farmed in the conventional way and can instead rapidly create vaccines to combat new threats. We are using what our own body is really good at to our own advantage which is replication.


But as mentioned before, the receptor proteins are the only part your immune system really needs in order to identify an invader, whether there is an actual virus behind it or not. It will still create that immunity but now it will not have to battle any kind of further replication from the virus. It is as benign of a response as you can possibly get as of this moment. It would be like rather than having to wait for another country to send you a replacement part for one of your tools, you just use your own 3D printer at home to print your own part that is just as effective, faster to produce and can be done using your own machinery for cents on the dollar. That saves so much energy, time and resources. Think of all the gas saved in order to ship it to you. How many people handle it. All the warehouse logistics needed to store it. The downtime is also unbelievably reduced with regards to the immune system.


The big issue with vaccines nowadays, is that with the first two that were mentioned, they need to be manually farmed which takes time but also by the time they are farmed, the virus could mutate which would force you to restart the whole process to keep up. Pathogens can sometimes out pace the speed in which we can produce a corresponding vaccine. This does not mean that we are destined to create a superbug from this process. With antibiotics, that could be possible but that is a completely different mechanism of medicine that is not really at all related to this ""arms race"". The ultimate goal is to hopefully eradicate the pathogen completely. As we know, that is not always possible so the next best option is to push the pathogen to being so benign that it essentially doesn't have any complications anymore and it just becomes a normal part of life. 


Even without vaccines, this will happen but because of the more intense immune response from the actual pathogen, a lot more people will die for no reason. There are ways to nudge pathogens to this negligible state without people having to die. The virus is not actually trying to kill people but this new land (our body) is so fertile and fresh that it can't help but spread so fast that it accidentally kills us. Even it ""wants"" a more harmonious existence with us, but they are dumb, simply invade and go wild, more than they should for their own good. The fact that people are dying means that it must mutate into a less deadly disease in order to keep spreading because the viruses that were deadly, did not pass their genes on. The deadly ones cease being able to spread because they limit the times the host interacts with others because they are now dead. Viruses do not know how to make themselves less deadly; the ones that are less deadly just tend to spread more since the host remains alive to allow it to spread.


*Vaccines help to nudge this process along by making your body as uninhabitable as a dead person.*


mRNA vaccines can accelerate this process unbelievably quicker than all the others because you are not relying on the farming of potentially obsolete viruses which will then create only weak immunities. If you are taking a vaccine it is the best idea possible to take one that creates the more direct ans specific response.


So with all of this in mind, that is what is the difference between infection and disease is. Infection is simply ""having the pathogen on or in your body"" which no vaccine could ever protect against. A bullet proof vest does not keep you from getting shot. A disease is when your body not only allows the pathogen to spread to unmanageable levels, but also has to devote a lot of resources, which is damaging to itself, in order to create a battle plan while also trying to fight the invader while causing a lot of harm to itself in the battle.


*If we did not have to devote a massive amounts of our budget to military expenditures, we could use those resources for other things. Sometimes it is necessary to have such a large military but if we can make it more efficient, why would we not? If we can have the exact same military size and power, but cut out a lot of the bureaucratic slow downs, why would we not prefer that?*


If we can make our bodies simulate the environment of a dead person, as in an environment that the virus can not spread in, it will have no choice but to revert to a less deadly version of itself to the point where we don't even need vaccines anymore. Viruses do not actually want to kill us, that does not benefit them. Finding a way to become completely undetected, which means essentially harmless, is the goal here for them and us. If something becomes so harmless that it doesn't even really cause problems, why would we even care about it anymore? It is the process of getting it to that point which is the deadly game. If we have a choice between risking people dying to get to that point or people not dying, why would we not choose the latter?

I can try to get them to stop talking and focus on their work but I’m fighting a losing battle here (especially being an English teacher; discussions are a big part of the curriculum and of course I can’t keep them all on-topic all the time). And I can’t really talk to them about the vaccine other than telling them I personally chose to get vaccinated and boosted because if they tell their parents something I said that the parents don’t like and they parents complain I could get fired for actually educating the children on vaccines! What a concept, teaching give children accurate information on current events that have a direct impact on their lives. Children have told me I will turn into a vampire or an alien because I am vaccinated. One kid has convinced several others that the vaccine not only doesn’t protect you from COVID but that it actually weakens your immune system’s ability to fight other illnesses. The unvaccinated children gang up on the vaccinated ones and make fun of them, telling them the same shit, that the kid is going to turn into a mutant or get cancer or something. And Lord knows kids may not be afraid of much but they are afraid of cancer. So I’ve had to deal with that drama from the vaccinated kids who they have given anxiety. Oh and now I think I have omicron. A lot of the students have been out sick and some of those who have stuck around have had pretty suspicious “allergies”.

 I have moved abroad from my home a few years ago to study in college, and since this whole mess started a few years ago, talking to my parents about current news is an emotional minefield. 

 My dad had always been a bit of a skeptic when it comes to government and news, which helped to give me a healthy ideal of searching for evidence when it comes to most things, but his reaction to COVID and the ensuing lockdown, masks and eventual vaccine, have bordered on paranoid conspiracy.

 My mom is more outspoken about activism then my dad, but in regards to foreign news and general health stuff, she tends to defer to him for ideas.

 As much as I want to be frank with them, I don't feel safe in talking about it and just let them rant about choice and freedom and tyranny and whatnot while just watching and nodding while occasionally saying some neutral annoyance at the whole situation. 

 I have tried having an open dialog before after doing some investigating, but both times, it resulted in a meltdown of yelling, teats and angry shutdowns that lasted a good few days before we could talk again.

 No matter what happens, my dad keeps following groups that constantly repost debunked articles and talking points like the Israel study and the whole bio weapon conspiracy,  and because she trusts him, my mom copies him.

 Ignoring it isn't an option for me, as much as I sometimes wish I could; I am just as hard-headed as my dad about my opinions and about conceding.

 I live next to a neighborhood with a large older senior population, and seeing how they have been affected over the years still haunts me.

 My biggest worry is my younger brother, who is just a few years younger and lives with them. He wants to come live with me abroad, but he doesn't have a job or money of his own, and so he's dependent on them at the moment.

 My dad is adamant about not taking a shot, and my mom hasn't because she follows him. Since he doesn't have a way to get around by himself and my dad refuses to take him because he's young and everything, my brother is also at risk.

 Everyday, I worry about them (both my parents work in the public sector and have frequent contact with other people), and yet I can't even be honest with my family (none of them know I have double dosed and plan on getting the booster).

 The point I'm trying to make on this long dumb rant is what should I do? How do I approach them at this point? Are there points or arguments that I could make that would help them understand where I'm coming from?

No matter what happens, they are my family and they mean the world to me, and I don't want to risk losing them because of this

antivax,,1642328047.0,Why vaccines are healthy and safe.,"*What is mRNA vaccines?

An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. The vaccine delivers molecules of antigen-encoding mRNA into immune cells, which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. These protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response that teaches the body to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. The mRNA is delivered by a co-formulation of the RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.

Reactogenicity, the tendency of a vaccine to produce adverse reactions, is similar to that of conventional non-RNA vaccines. People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to messenger RNA vaccines. The advantages of mRNA vaccines over traditional vaccines are ease of design, speed and lower cost of production, the induction of both cellular and humoral immunity, and lack of interaction with the genomic DNA.[5][6] While some messenger RNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, have the disadvantage of requiring ultracold storage before distribution, other mRNA vaccines, such as the Moderna, CureVac, and Walvax COVID-19 vaccines, do not have such requirements.

*How is mRNA vaccines different from traditional vaccines?

Vaccines work by training our bodies to recognize invading viruses. Traditional vaccines perform this task by introducing a dead, inactive, or modified portion of a virus into our body so that our immune system can learn to recognize and fight this foreign invader.

In the case of Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA vaccines, we are not injected with a whole virus or even a piece. Instead, we are supplied mRNA that instructs our cells to make a version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These instructions teach our cells to become their own vaccine manufacturing plants.

In the lab, scientists create synthetic mRNA containing the spike protein sequence. This encoded information is delivered through the jab, and it instructs some of our cells to manufacture spike proteins. The spike proteins trigger our immune cells to assemble antibodies capable of recognizing them. If the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus behind COVID-19, infects a vaccinated person, then the trained antibodies sound an alarm, leading to an immune response to fend off the infection.

The fundamental idea behind using a vaccine to teach a body’s immune system dates back over 200 years, but the use of mRNA is a recent development. Compared to other methods, mRNA leads the way in both speed and flexibility.

*Why is mRNA vaccines preferred?

In theory, the underlying technology behind mRNA vaccines is adaptable, allowing for quick updates as new viral mutations (variants) evolve or whole new viruses are discovered. Since mRNA vaccines are based on sequences of viral proteins, making a new vaccine could simply involve changing the mRNA sequence if you know what protein you want to make.

mRNA vaccines are also quicker and more reliably manufactured than traditional vaccines. For Moderna, the entire process—from vaccine design to manufacturing to shipment—took only 7 weeks. Although design and production of mRNA vaccines may take only weeks, necessary clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy still require several months of testing.

In contrast, other forms of vaccines use disabled or weakened viruses (i.e. measles and hepatitis A). These can take months or years to design. Manufacturing enough viruses to vaccinate a large portion of society can be a cumbersome process. For example, the influenza virus is grown inside fertilized chicken eggs, which are obtained from sterile laying facilities.

*Which is better? Letting people get natural immunity or vaccinating them?

The average mortality rate of covid 19 is 3% and it may not sound much, but there are 7.9 billion people on earth.

So if 3 per 100 people died due to covid. Then the death toll would be 237000000 people. And it would be much higher as the health care system would collapse due to overload leading lack of care and unsanitary conditions.

The adverse effects related to covid vaccine (this data might be inaccurate since it might not be vaccine related)

Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare and has occurred in approximately 5 people per one million vaccinated.

Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. More than 520 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through January 10, 2022. During this time, VAERS received 11,225 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA clinicians review reports of death to VAERS including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.

There are few other vaccine related adverse effects but it is yet to be understood if its true and the scale is minuscule.

*How does covid 19 mRNA vaccines work? (And few other types of vaccines)

A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine can prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19. But how do the different types of COVID-19 vaccines work?

Each COVID-19 vaccine causes the immune system to create antibodies to fight COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines use a harmless version of a spikelike structure on the surface of the COVID-19 virus called an S protein.


The main types of COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the U.S. or being studied include:

Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. This type of vaccine uses genetically engineered mRNA to give your cells instructions for how to make the S protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. After vaccination, your muscle cells begin making the S protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. This causes your body to create antibodies. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, these antibodies will fight the virus.

After delivering instructions, the mRNA is immediately broken down. It never enters the nucleus of your cells, where your DNA is kept. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA.

Vector vaccine. In this type of vaccine, genetic material from the COVID-19 virus is placed in a modified version of a different virus (viral vector). When the viral vector gets into your cells, it delivers genetic material from the COVID-19 virus that gives your cells instructions to make copies of the S protein. Once your cells display the S proteins on their surfaces, your immune system responds by creating antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.

Viral vector vaccines can't cause you to become infected with the COVID-19 virus or the viral vector virus. Also, the genetic material that's delivered doesn't become part of your DNA. The Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is a vector vaccine. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford also have a vector COVID-19 vaccine.

Protein subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines include only the parts of a virus that best stimulate your immune system. This type of COVID-19 vaccine contains harmless S proteins. Once your immune system recognizes the S proteins, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.

Novavax is working on a protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine.

OH MY FUCKING GOD, GET THE FUCKING VACCINE ALREADY, YOU FUCKING FUCKS

Our most-read article of 2021.

Originally published September 2, 2021.

Hi, if you are reading this essay then congratulations, you are still alive. And if you are alive, then you have either gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, or you still have the opportunity to get the vaccine against COVID-19. And holy fuck, if you aren’t fucking vaccinated against COVID-19, then you need to get fucking vaccinated right now. I mean, what the fuck? Fuck you. Get vaccinated. Fuck.

The fucking vaccine will not make you magnetic. Are you fucking kidding me? It just fucking won’t. That’s not even a fucking thing, and that lady who tried to pretend the vaccine made her fucking magnetic looked like a real fucking fuckwad and a fucking idiot, so get fucking vaccinated. Jesus. Fuck.

The vaccine also doesn’t have a fucking 5G chip in it. What the fuck do you think a fucking 5G chip is, fucknuts? You think it’s like some invisible nanotechnology they can suspend in a liquid and then just put in your fucking blood and then it what, exactly? Fucking floats around in your body going on Instagram and telling the government you went to the grocery store? No one fucking cares where you go, you absolute fucking fuck-barf. Fuck off with that. Fuck.

Oh, you’re afraid of fucking side effects? Fuck you. You know what has fucking side effects? Fucking aspirin, fucking Tylenol. You could be fucking allergic to pineapple, you fucking fuckwit. Everything has side effects. You’re being a big fucking baby with a huge diaper full of fucking diarrhea, complaining about maybe feeling slightly tired for a day or two while your asymptomatic COVID case you get and pass to some innocent fucking kid could wind up killing them or someone else. Fuck you, you fucking selfish fucking shit-banana, you unredeemable ass-caterpillar, you fucking fuck-knob with two fucks for eyes and a literal poop where your heart should be. You want a two-month-old to wind up on a fucking ventilator instead of you, a fucking adult, getting a fucking sore arm for a day? What are you, a pitcher for the Yankees? A fucking concert pianist? An arm model? Get the fuck out of here! Fuck you. Get vaccinated. Fuck. Fuck

You think vaccines don’t fucking work? Oh, fuck off into the trash, you attention-seeking fuckworm-faced shitbutt. This isn’t even a point worth discussing, you fuck-o-rama fuck-stival of ignorance. Vaccines got rid of smallpox and polio and all the other disgusting diseases that used to kill off little fucks like you en masse. Your relatives got fucking vaccinated and let you live, and now here you are signing up to be killed by a fucking disease against which there is a ninety-nine-percent effective vaccine. You fucking moron. Go in the fucking ocean and fuck a piranha. Fuck. Fuck that. Fuck you. Get vaccinated.

Oh, you say you have a genuine allergy or medical condition that prevents you from receiving a fucking vaccine? That’s fine. I’m clearly not talking to you. I fucking love you. Fuck.

Look, if you have been forwarded this essay from a friend or loved one, then there are two possibilities. Either you are a normal, regular, sensible fucking person like me who got fucking vaccinated at the first possible moment, and this essay channels all your fucking rage and sadness and is therefore cathartic OR, and I really hope this isn’t the fucking case, you AREN’T fucking vaccinated, and someone sent it to you because you fucking fucking fuck, you need to get fucking vaccinated. And rather than being fucking offended that someone is trying yet again to get you to take the fucking vaccine, you should understand that someone fucking loves you enough to try one last motherfucking time to get you to take the fucking vaccine before you fuck off to heaven, or hell, or some in-between place that’s just like a fucking mall or something where everything is free, including and especially the soft pretzels. 

So, congratulations! There is ONE person remaining in your life who wants to fucking save you from drowning in your own fucking lungs, you fucking fuckshit fuckdick, so for god’s sake, get your fucking ass out of your chair, go to the fucking pharmacy, and get a fucking vaccine, you absolute conscienceless fucking fuck fuck fuck. Get it. Get the fucking vaccine. Fuck you. Fuck fuck fuck. Fuck. Fuck you. Fuck!",s0928t,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/s0928t/this_made_me_laugh_so_hard_lots_of_use_of_the/,34

I don’t know about you, but when such a high percentage of the people who have spent years in school, laboratories, and jobs in the relevant fields, aka the people who know more about this stuff than the average person could ever know, when those people almost unanimously agree that people need to get vaccinated, for me it would be so completely irrational to listen to someone saying, “Well, they don’t know what they’re talking about,” or, “I know better than they do,” that it actually hurts my brain trying to comprehend how the minds of those that say such things work.

It’s like if I, who knows zero about how car engines operate, after being told by ten highly rated mechanics in my area that my car is making that noise because of a bad muffler, listened instead to my Uncle Jimbo who likes to watch YouTube video’s about car mechanics, when he tells me all I need to do is run a little engine cleaner down the fuel line.

It’s like that, except in this case, by me listening to Jimbo and not getting a new muffler, other people with whom I come into contact cars’ mufflers start failing as well.  And while the muffler problem isn’t likely to be fatal to your car, all of a sudden, so many cars are at at all the local mechanics getting work done on their mufflers that when cousin Susan does have a problem with her car, where, if not taken care of immediately it will cause irreparable damage, poor cousin Susan isn’t able to find a mechanic with the time or space to see her.

Basically, just think rationally about it, block out all of the external noise, and the answer of what to do shouldn’t be too hard to grasp.

antivax,crazy-robot-guy,1640215736.0,"Need Gift Recommendations For ""Vaccine Hesitant"" Uncle","So, not sure if this fits here, but it seemed like a good place to ask - my family is doing a secret santa for Christmas, and I was assigned to get a gift for an uncle of mine who has been generally skeptical of anything ""science"" for as long as I've known him, and has been somewhat vocal about how his analysis of the COVID vaccine's effectiveness (seemingly done mostly via blog posts flashy headlines, occasionally references ""studies from X"" without ever actually pointing to a specific study that someone can actually read to verify.) indicates that it is more likely to cause severe side effects than he's likely to get a severe infection of COVID, and that it does not protect against transmission at all, at most it just prevents symptoms (I understand that transmission prevention has been trending downwards, but my understanding is that it was actually pretty good for many vaccines early on).

I should also point out that he's also *very* far left, and has held some very anti-capitalist views since long before COVID - one side argument he sometimes throws out is that the vaccines are just being pushed because they're moneymakers for ""big pharma"" (even though you would think the treatments in development would be more so). He's also not, as far as I understand, skeptical of COVID in general - from what I hear, he's very good about wearing a mask indoors (though he insists on some form of all-natural, totally reusable, cotton masks, which sometimes seem to have a dubiously loose weave), and generally understands that this is a real thing.

Anyway, I wanted to take this opportunity to feed him some information that may make him actually stop and think about what the fuck a guy with no formal medical education who flunked out of high school math and seems to take pride in subscribing to scientific ""theories"" that are as counter to mainstream as possible purely on the basis that mainstream science is corrupt is doing claiming that he knows better than people who have studied for years and devoted their lives to this stuff. I don't mind causing serious offense to him (almost prefer it, really), but the main goal is to just get him to start thinking critically about this as opposed to taking the ""radical"" viewpoint by default. The rest of my family seems to mostly have the attitude of ""respect everyone's opinion equally"", and many of them seem to really listen to him and take his opinion seriously - my grandmother went to visit him a few months ago, and after I convinced her to get fully vaccinated first time around, is now echoing his opinions and refusing to get a booster mainly because ""big pharma"".

Sorry this was kind of long-winded, but it you made it this far, any ideas?

BTW, most of my family considers Christmas to be January 7th (not uncommon for ""orthodox"" branches of Christianity, it comes from not adjusting dates when most of the world switched from the Julien calendar to the Gregorian), so I'm not super pressed for time here.

antivax,bebespeaks,1640156525.0,My experience with chicken pox illnesses and the need for mandatory immunization.,"My story, I am pro-vaccine, and do not wish any preventable illnesses upon anyone in this world.

***in the 90s, the chicken pox vaccine wasn't mainstream yet, and I had had the chicken pox at least 3x before the age of 8. Then I got a rash, fever, blisters and pustles all over my body around Halloween of 1998, when I was 8 and a half. The illness was called Roseolla, in the chicken pox family of bacterial diseases but closer to shingles, and I remember going to the local clinic, I was NOT gassed or anesthetized, the nursing staff and a doctor used large bore needles to siphon and drain all the bacterial puss from the blisters on my body, from my crotch and thighs up to my not-yet-pubescent chest and my neck and along my jaw line, puss oozing out from all the blisters....I remember the pain, they didn't knock me out, and the phenomena of ""childhood amnesia"" didnt mask the pain for me. My brain was like FOREVER U WILL REMEMBER, U BITCH. I wouldn't wish such tortourus pain upon my worst enemies, or upon violent felons serving multiple life sentences in maximum security prisons. I remember it. And yes, my future children will be vaccinated bc I don't wish any preventable illnesses upon them. I've had chicken pox once more as an adult, and shingles twice in the last 10 years. A vaccine wouldn't help me, but it will help young children who haven't had chicken pox yet, so my future kids will be vaccinated against it. There's no reason to let your children suffer something preventable just bc mommy or daddy had to suffer when they were kids. If there were a vaccine for Mononucleosis and Strep Throat, I would vaccinate against those as well.

I had Mononucleosis the entirety of summer 2006, throughout my 10th grade year of high school of 2006-2007, and nearly until October of my 11th grade year when I Transfered schools to attend school closer to home. I lost a lot of weight, nearly 30 lbs in 15 months, couldn't keep the weight on, barely had the appetite to eat more than a 1yr old starting solids, experienced a lot of incontinence and had to go back to  pull-ups at bedtime, I had no energy for sports or physical activities, I slept a lot and had a lot of fainting spells, I had difficulty. 

I had H1N1/swine flu for about 2 weeks in summer of 2009, followed by Strep Throat for another 3 weeks in majority of September that year. Chicken pox again in January of 2010, couldn't miss a lot of college classes but I did take myself out of freelance-babysitting for nearly 6 weeks, as it would have been very unwise and unethical for me to expose younger children ages 3 to 14 to chickenpox/shingles. 

Vaccines are important, to prevent unjust and unfair suffering to those who don't need or deserve it. If it is preventable, then prevent it. Don't let children suffer just because you think you know more than scientists and doctors, or because you follow trendsetters and influencers who think that essential oils are more superior than scientifically proven immunizations.",rlzi65,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/rlzi65/my_experience_with_chicken_pox_illnesses_and_the/,1

Most of the people that work for me are very anit-Biden and anti-vaccine. I have one person that I can have a constructive conversation with despite his conspiracy leaning mind. I get told today that he has read a great letter that was sent the WHO by Geert Vanden Bossche. He sends me the link to the PDF:

[https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/616004c52e87ed08692f5692/6180d0742de00f1d9cd1f0a6\_who-open-letter.pdf](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/616004c52e87ed08692f5692/6180d0742de00f1d9cd1f0a6_who-open-letter.pdf) (Hopefully links are allowed)

In good faith I take the time to read the whole stupid letter. The TL/DR of the letter is the vaccines do not work at preventing the spread of COVID, and because they are leaky vaccines they are causing more mutations, and we need to stop mass-vaccinations right now.

So I do what I always do when presented with new information like this letter claims. I start looking at everything from the content to the author. I had to send a rebuttal. I found one that actually didn't go for a character assassination of the author, but disputed it line by line with 46 cited sources or studies.

[https://www.deplatformdisease.com/blog/addressing-geert-vanden-bossches-claims](https://www.deplatformdisease.com/blog/addressing-geert-vanden-bossches-claims)

I didn't know how well this would be received, as in the past most of my shops vaccination conversations have devolved into arguments and how I am just a sheep. He tried to argue that still that mRNA ""vaccines"" are not vaccines, and are the cause of the variants. I calmly pointed out that the Delta variant was discovered in India in December 2020, and India's vaccine rollout didn't happen until January 2021. Those pesky facts!!

Well I am going to just chalk this up as a small victory. The email response I got back was:

""ok fine...the only thing I know for sure is that I know nothing"" Socrates

No further rebuttal, no arguments coming back. He actually asked where I found this article. I told him it was not hard, I just googled the name of the person that wrote the letter. Maybe I am being naïve, but I hope this might have broke through a little to show how he has fallen for so much disinformation.

Thanks for reading! Just wanted to share the one semi-positive interaction I have had in the last 2 years!

this just proves that people dont read them properly. vaccine does give you extra protection when you had covid already thus making the chances to get covid more slimmer than ever.

but for those people who did not have covid before vaccinations or one, chances are higher them to go through it, mainly reason their immune system is not customed to it yet. and for the note covid vaccinations does not remove covid fully but eases the symptons that covid makes.

I'm 17M, living in Florida. My parents are extremely antivax. For school, my parents have requested religious exemptions in the past but they have been denied so at least I've gotten vaccinated for school requirements. 

As for the COVID vaccine, my parents won't budge and they believe in all the usual antivax claims: it's experimental, the government is hiding deaths caused by the vaccine, it will cause fevers and headaches (which is actually true but normal), it's ineffective, it is causing the mutations/variants, it increases spread of the virus, etc. Yes they are on a bunch of antivax facebook groups too.

2 months ago, our whole family got COVID, my dad had trouble breathing and had to go to the hospital, but he's fine now. My older brother (19M) got vaccinated and he was the only one who didn't get COVID, which got my parents aware that he got vaccinated, and extremely angry and even blaming it on him for spreading the virus (based on their antivax claims they believe). Despite all this happening, they won't change their mind.

Now, I'm really concerned about my and other people's health, and I work at a grocery store where not all customers wear masks, which I'm also considering quitting and working at a place that requires masks. 

Is there anything I can do to get vaccinated without parental consent? Only a few US states allow minors to get vaccinated without parental consent, Florida is not one of them.

antivax,vaxxed-throwaway,1637515765.0,An antivaxxer I know sent me this absurd list of reasons why they don't trust vaccines. What do you think?,"Here's a [gish gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop) of claims I saw an antivax person I know write recently.

My sense is that they don't have a strong grasp of any of the relevant science, and I'm not seeking a point-by-point rebuttal here - that would be a waste of everyone's time. **But I'm curious what you all think of this person's depth of actual understanding is vs. what sounds like confused paranoia.**

For context, this person decided not to vaccinate their child and is in general a full-blown conspiracy theorist (into QAnon, COVID-19 denial etc.).

* A mother’s breast milk has a tiny amount of aluminum in it, which is safe for babies to consume. Via ingestion, aluminum’s absorption rate is less than 10%, most is expelled by the body - and quickly. In contrast, aluminum salts in adjuvants which are injected directly are 100% absorbed and may linger dangerously for a long time, causing neurological issues.

* When injected directly into the bloodstream, the immune system / body has no defenses, and is on “red alert” as a foreign substance has suddenly been introduced into the body. In other words, aluminum salts in injected vaccine adjuvants bypass the body’s immune system entirely.

* Adjuvants in vaccines actually weaken the immune system.

* Injected aluminum salts bypass the blood-brain barrier leaving these dangerous ingredients to collect in the brain.

* Vaccines have been mostly useless historically, and not really responsible for saving lives, preventing illness. The timing of their “effectiveness” is an illusion, since the decline in cases/deaths are actually due to modernized and more sanitary living conditions world-wide.

* Herd immunity is BS, since even when vaccinated you can still get a “preventable illness.”

* Less than 10% of adults in North America are fully up-to-date on their vaccinations.

* Vaccine effectiveness wears off over time. Because of this, we can’t consider them truly effective.

* The stats on measles cases, deaths use worldwide numbers, to give the impression there’s a real first-world risk, when the only risk is in the third world. Put another way, the measles is mild; only in the third world where they lack modern amenities and medical care is it deadly.

* Measles - like all other “vaccine preventable diseases” - is incredibly rare in the developed world, so its danger is overstated.

* If someone gets measles while vaccinated, their immune system will be compromised, in a way they wouldn’t be if they got it while unvaccinated.

* Immunization doesn’t work, because being vaccinated doesn’t guarantee you won’t still catch a “preventable disease”, in other words protection is not 100%. Even being fully up-to-date on vaccinations doesn’t protect you from getting every single illness you’ve been “apparently” immunized for.

* Vaccines are purported (by the “pro-vax” side) to be a one-size-fits-all preventative or cure.

* Because we don’t know exactly how each individual will react to a vaccine, it’s probably more dangerous than it’s worth.

* Antibiotics being prescribed for pertussis, a.k.a. whooping cough, is questionable.

* Vitamins A, C and D are effective and recommended treatments for pertussis (whooping cough). In other words, if someone gets whooping cough, they should “pound vitamins A, C and D!”

* The pertussis vaccine wouldn’t prevent immunized people from getting whooping cough.

* “Of all the vaccine ingredients, which ones would you say are good for you?” The implication being that dosages of chemicals in vaccine ingredients are dangerous.

* Preventable disease outbreaks? Where? How many? A handful?

* If someone gets the measles while vaccinated, it’s most likely they got it from the vaccine.

* Getting measles while vaccinated is likely to make someone sick for weeks, and they’ll require vaccines - over and over for the rest of their life - to be “safe.”

* Getting measles while not vaccinated gives one a leg up, as there are no dangerous substances being injected into the body. Getting it naturally gives the body a chance to do its job, resulting in a strengthened immune system.

* Mothers who have had measles “naturally” pass lifelong immunity onto their children.

* “Hundreds of hours of testimony from parents and medical professionals” amounts to verifiable scientific/medical evidence.

* Doctors only get 30 minutes in medical school learning about vaccines

* Of those injured by vaccines, it is speculated that only 10% of reactions are reported.

* Of those injured, very few have the finances to take their cases to the vaccine court.

* $4 billion of taxpayer money has been paid out by the vaccine court (via the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program) in the US. This is evidence that vaccines are unsafe.

* If vaccines were safe, someone would claim the $100k offered by Robert De Niro and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by proving this to be the case.

* A two year-old living in the first world is in no danger by not being vaccinated.",qyztlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/qyztlz/an_antivaxxer_i_know_sent_me_this_absurd_list_of/,6

antivax,,1636993320.0,You are the experiment.,"One thing we have been told is that this COVID vaccine has gone through the same rigorous testing that any other vaccine goes through and that it wasn’t rushed to the market (anecdotally, we literally named the vaccine development Operation Warp Speed). So was the development rushed? Is this an experimental vaccine? Let’s use this Johns Hopkins article comparing Typical and Accelerated Timelines to see if, perhaps, the argument can be made that people are taking a rushed, experimental vaccine.

[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/timeline](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/timeline)

We know that under normal circumstances the typical time it takes to develop a vaccine is 5-10 years, with the shortest development time ever being 4 years. It should raise an eyebrow when vaccine development happens in under a year. Vaccine apologists will tack on decades of mRNA research to the development of this COVID vaccine to give it long term research credibility, but ultimately that argument fails. First, this is the most generous (I would argue dishonest) possible way to characterize the development of mRNA vaccines. I read one article that put the beginning of mRNA vaccine research in the 1960s with the discovery of mRNA. That’s like saying development of the automobile started with the discovery of fire. That’s just disingenuous. Also, my long-term memory works. I remember last year when mRNA was heralded as a new, cutting edge vaccine technology that will change the world. Well, until people were unsure of injecting themselves with a new, cutting edge technology. That’s when the story changed to mRNA vaccines have been around for decades. I am expected to forget. I do not forget. Just like I remember that Kamala Harris thought Joe Biden was a racist sexual assailant, until she had the chance to be VP. More importantly, though, other traditional vaccine development methods were also known for decades, yet those traditional vaccines were still required to follow the long path to safe development. I understand why; COVID panic caused the rushed development of this vaccine. Fair enough, but let’s just own that fact. People were panicked so they changed the rules of vaccine development.

Vaccine apologists will also tell you that this COVID vaccine, just like all other vaccines, went through all three phases of clinical trials before being approved by the FDA. That is true, with two Barry Bonds sized asterisks. First, the phases overlapped and happened concurrently. Phase II started while Phase I was still ongoing, and Phase III started while Phase II was still ongoing. That is unconventional. Phase I only assess short term safety and can happen quickly, fair enough, but Phase II usually takes 2-3 years. Then after they are sure a vaccine is safe in Phase II, they move on to Phase III, which takes another 2-4 years. They did all of this in about 8ish months. So, what normally takes 48-84 months took about 8 months. If that isn’t the definition of rushed, I don’t know the definition of rushed. However, I just checked the definition of rushed and that definition applies here.  Which, again, if you have confidence in the vaccine you should take it. But let’s not be dishonest. COVID panic caused the rushed development of this vaccine.

The bigger asterisk, however, is the shortening of Phase III trials. Typically, this phase takes 2-4 years and one of the major goals of Phase III is assessing short-term and long-term safety. According to the Johns Hopkins Accelerated Timeline, in Phase III there is 6-9 months of early assessment with “follow-up continuing for two years or more to assess long-term safety and efficacy.” So the FDA approved a vaccine that didn’t have the type of long-term assessment normally demanded from traditional vaccines. This is even more sketchy feeling because mRNA vaccine technology had never been used like this in humans. I’m sorry, but that means that everyone who is vaccinated is part of the ongoing Phase III trials. Vaccine apologists will say Phase III is over, but that’s just redefining what Phase III has meant in the past. This is akin to when President Bush announced the mission in Iraq was accomplished in 2003 but in 2011 we still had tens of thousands of troops in Iraq. If Phase III trials normally take 2-4 years to assess long-term safety and we haven’t had this vaccine for 2-4 years to assess long-term safety then you’re in what would normally be called Phase III, no matter what they call it now. Maybe we can call it Phase III.b?

Either way, because we didn’t follow typical timelines and practices to develop this new vaccine technology, so the labels “rushed” and “experimental” certainly seem to apply to this vaccine and to the reason I’m not comfortable taking it. Yet.

Scott Atlas said, concerning public health leaders, that ""...stopping Covid cases at all costs instead of considering all of health harms, and a shocking lack of critical thinking about the science, this was a  reckless abuse of public health and a moral failure..."".

if the  vaccine is about depop why didn't the poorer countries receive it first?  the richest countries were first in line while most of the  african continent has no access to a vaccine. also in the countries who  have it the politicians and the very wealthy were first in line to get  the vaccine before it was available to anyone else. wouldn't a plan for  depop target the poor?

what is the  benefit of depopulation? most of the rich are eagerly expanding  marketshare. they want more consumers and more workers, not less. there  are more than enough resources. who does depopulation benefit?

the  government has been trying to unroll facial recognition technology  forever to spy on us wherever we go. advertisers also want to use this  technology to better target us. masks prevent them from spying on us. so  if masking is a conspiracy who does it benefit making us mask up?

None of them are vaccinated against COVID-19, I'm the only one. Recently, my BF's brother had a baby. While SIL was 9 months pregnant, we spoke about random pregnancy/maternity stuff and I was horrified as she started talking about vaccination risks and how she's rather willing to pay the fine for not having vaccinated her child. She didn't seem decided yet (I remember her b\*tching about antivax mums just a few years ago), but I can't help but wonder: IF she doesn't have her (now 5 days old) baby vaccinated what am I supposed to do in the future - as a mother of a NOT YET vaccinated baby? Should a mother not allow unvaccinated people around her fragile baby and become the enemy of the entire family? What are the risks?

Which led me to these questions. How can an unvaccinated person get an illness that has been ""eradicated"" by vaccines? I'm pretty sure that kindergartens will soon be filled with unvaccinated children, but how do these children contract the illnesses if their older siblings, parents, aunts, granparents, etc. have been vaccinated? What are the chances of an unvaccinated baby contracting a dangerous illness from one unvaccinated child that attends the kindergarten, plays at playgrounds, etc.?

antivax,Litmanair-876,1635632055.0,I want to travel but I have to be jabbed and comply - HELP,"(Vent Warning.)

Good afternoon everyone. I am an anti-mask (at school) 17 year old living in Florida. Masks are still mandated in my school district, but I try whatever I can to not listen. I know it's Halloween tomorrow, but I just decided to vent right now to get it over with. Personally, I have no problem with other people wanting to wear masks, get vaccinated, and live in fear and live like it's 2020 forever. However, we should realize this closing everything down is all from the government, not the virus. The government gave into the fear, and now we have to inject an experimental MRNA therapy into us, which was less than a year of testing, the long-term side effects are still unknown, and people have been constantly getting injured and dying from this. 

The truth is, as long as you're young and healthy, there is no need for this. We have immune systems, let them do the thing. Look at the true statistics. The death rate for young and healthy people is extremely low, and children are more likely to get murdered than die from COVID. Teenage boys aged 15-19 have a 99.997% chance of survival rate. There is literally no need to mandate this death jab. There is no need for restrictions, and the way to end them is **DO NOT COMPLY.** 

**I want to travel to Europe in December 2021 (London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Milan to be more precise), but I'm scared I'll get severe side effects and/or die within the next year, or even this year. And if I don't get jabbed, I will have to risk taking these quarantines, which means I won't be able to enjoy my trip.** Before you go off on me, I didn't plan this trip (my parents did), and I honestly wouldn't during these tyrannic times, but whatever. This is also my very first time to Europe. I will still wear a mask on the plane (even though I am an anti-masker), and in some places if not, I will be fined. And I don't want to pay fines. I am a bit upset I won't be able to do this trip normally, but whatever. Look, natural immunity is more effective than artificial immunity, and I really feel I’m doing this all for nothing. I got testrd twice and I’m negative.

I really want to travel to Europe, but I am also getting jabbed on November 6. And I'm extremely scared about what's gonna happen to me. I need help. **Is it true that I will get severe side effects and heart disease from the experiment? Is it true that I will be dead within the next year?** I am so scared. I can either kill myself with this death jab, or care about my health and never travel. This material is extremely new. **What should I do? When and how will these mandates and restrictions all end and we can get back to 2019 normal? I am very open minded and willing to hear tips to overcome the fear of v\*x injury and death. Is it rare?**

Update 6 November 2021: Actually, my mind is now relaxed, and I finally got jabbed with Pfizer! I probably wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t mandated, but whatever, at least I will now have less restrictions! I am hoping to show my papers, passport, and have a fun time abroad next month! My fears over “I’ll die within 5 years” has greatly relaxed. However, I will still wear a mask on the plane, and I am not a pro-masker.

antivax,,1635301495.0,Real long term consequences,"So, I've seen time and time again the phrase ""what about the long term consequences of the vaccine?"" 

Well, I work in Health field and I will give you some occupations and their typical chemicals and/or conditions that have long term health consequences and then I want you to examine yourself and see if you put as much effort into avoiding these circumstances as you have the vaccine.

1) Welding, metal fabrication, and foundry work (I hope everyone saw this coming) exposes you to some beautiful metals like: lead, copper, aluminum, chromium and molybdenum. Did you know that over a five year exposure to any of these can give you cancer? Did you know that something like a direct exhaust fan can eliminate that risk? 

2) Construction, and masonry. These lovely professions exposure you to silica! Wait silicon, that's everywhere, how does that have long term health consequences? Well, when you saw through pavement or have seen someone saw through pavement you probably notice a big clouds of dust. That's silica particles, and they give you silicosis. Those silica particles are actually tiny and jagged. They lodge in your lung and make it hard for you to breathe a la silicosis. It's just like asbestosis only these particles are legal to use everywhere. All you need to do to prevent this dust is use water when cutting. Do you? Even when you're in a hurry on that big project?

3) Oil and gas! You know about all those fun little plastics that are causing problems everywhere? Would you believe that daily exposure to their precursors is even worse? Well, it is. The people working in oil and gas can look forward to exposures of benzene, toluene, oleum, sulfur trioxide, sulfuric acid and other fun petroleum distillates! A lot of which cause cancer. Others cause infertility and erectile dysfunction! 

To end it I'm going to state one last argument I've heard: ""well I don't work in those industries I have a big boy degree and work in an office."" That's a fine argument, and it might be good, except that if the people working in those industries don't get vaccinated they'll be stuck in the hospital. Then the supply lines will get clogged up. You may even lose power or you could even lose your job and be forced into one of those industries, because the long term effect of an unchecked pandemic is economic instability.

antivax,,1635194745.0,do we have any common ground,"is there any chance of the american people finding common ground? can this divide be bridged? first of all i don't think the majority of people trust the government or big pharma, no matter where they fall politically. but the fear of covid being a government ploy to control us has put many liberals in the ironic position of having to defend the government against what to them is a strawman argument of bad science combined with fear. our infighting is causing us to attack each other and keep our focus off of the true issues and real loss of our freedoms. this is an ancient tactic of government, to keep us divided and fighting when together we would truly have the power to create a better government.

if your premise is that the government is using covid to control us and take away our freedoms and/or used for population control i ask you to consider these points.

why did the vaccine become available for the wealthy and the politicians before anyone else? nearly every politician regardless of politics is vaccinated, with some exceptions of course. why are my family in africa for example still unable to get the vaccine, and african labs are having to create their own vaccines because wealthy nations won't share with them? if the vaccine was rushed and uncertain why wouldn't they test a vaccine on the poor populations first. if the goal was population reduction same point applies, why wouldn't they make this broadly available across the world.

what is the benefit of population control to the wealthy and those in power? the wealthy have grown their wealth during the pandemic. how would the rich who is eternally striving to increase their marketshare benefit from killing off their own consumers and workers?

if the vaccine is a ploy to track us and limit our movements, then why also push the mask mandate? how does the government benefit from allowing citizens to protect our identities in public by use of masks, when they have been trying to roll-out facial recognition software in order to track us in every public space. if our concern is truly that we do not want the government tracking us then why aren't we focused on undoing the patriot act, or outlawing facial recognition software, or limiting the ability of facebook and apple to track our every move?

finally, if the government really wanted population control, don't you think they have a million ways to do it immediately and on a grand scale. they have viruses that can kill immediately and with higher death rates. ebola for example. what is the benefit to them of taxing the health care system with a long drawn out pandemic.

if you don't want the vaccine, they are never coming to your door to force you to take it. you will face some repercussions from making the choice not to take it, such as not being able to go to certain restaurants or venues, but your freedom to choose is not in jeopardy.

can we finally bury this nonsensical conspiracy theory and work together on the very real issues and loss of our freedoms at hand? or is it too late.

edited to add tl:dr how would the government benefit from killing off their own citizens when all governments/corporations want more consumers/taxpayers, not less, and if this is a ploy to track us then why are they also pushing the mask mandate which allows us to preserve our anonymity in public spaces, masks give us a new freedom against being tracked.",qfpz24,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/qfpz24/do_we_have_any_common_ground/,10

I debunk the posts the best I can to her but she's so incredibly stubborn and brain washed by those bloody posts. She believes a Facebook post over doctors.. literal qualified professionals. 

The one she sent me today was about a kid named James, he passed because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy if I remember right. Rest in peace if he's real. It said that 2 weeks after he got the vaccine, he just collapsed.. Right. Anyway the post was a message from the parents who said the vaccine gave them a sore arm and a headache, - common side effects from the covid jab - she went crazy over that. Told her it was common, ignored me. 

Worst thing is she's spreading the fact that ""a kid collapsed and died because of the covid-19 vaccine"" to everyone. I mean, the post did say ""COPY PASTE TO SPREAD THIS MESSAGE!!"" at the end so guess she took that seriously. 

My brother has also been fighting with her over it. Some of her points include: being pro choice (I respect it, but she is literally against abortions), ivermectin?, ""it's the same as the flu"", government conspiracies, just use the power of magnesium and vitamin D. 

Atp I'm thinking of creating and sending a clickbait anti-vax post, making it legit until the very end where I tell her it's fake and how naive she is for believing it in the first place.

antivax,Just_Hika,1634805184.0,"So, my mom is an anti-vax...","My mom started becoming an anti-vax quite a couple months ago (completely out of the blue, probably when someone just started going full anti-vax mode in a random Zalo (Vietnamese equivalent to WhatsApp) group with a bunch of 82'ers in it and posted videos of people randomly falling in the streets of China calling it death by vaccine). The first time I took notice of it is when my mom asked me to sign her up for Telegram and join a supposedly Vietnamese group (which turns out to have a herd of anti-vaxxers). Since then she went full psycho and decided to ask every single person that she meets if they have been vaccinated - which she will probably advice them not to take any further jabs and shit like that.

Until she started to tell me not to take the vaccines and showing videos of people falling on the streets in China and random people protesting in Europe (probably the 2018? French protests). I just decided to practice my debating skills (since I'm in a debate club) and counter each and every of her arguments, which she would either respond with ""Shut the fuck up"" or throwing some other insults at my face. Yeah, I actually insulted her once and she was really pissed (and **constantly** bugged me **every single god damn fucking time** about it also).

Oh yeah, she also believes in **already debunked** fake news (like Japanese government banning microwave ovens and nanochips/nanobots in the COVID vaccines). My response to those is just to organize raids on Telegram with my friend on those groups as an effort to disrupt those info (which was absolutely hilarious when people asking for admins' help in vain)

Now obviously she won't believe in actual news sources and instead believes in random 40-year-old self-proclaimed ""doctors"" and trying to throw money on my face if I **don't take the COVID test and the vaccine...**",qcn7w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/qcn7w9/so_my_mom_is_an_antivax/,3

Let me start off by saying that I've had every shot a child could ever get, and even as an adult I've gotten flu shots / whatever was mandated where I'm from. 

This may not be the perfect place to ask, but I saw that you are an informed bunch, so maybe you could help me find information. 

I spoked with my doctor, and several others in person due to my vaccine hesitancy. 

**Source of hesitancy:** 

I've had pericarditis & myocarditis before (rare, but documented symptom common in my age group - man in 20's, for people that get mRNA vax) 

None of the medical professionals I've spoken too had information directly on them, and did not share anything with me regarding my concerns. 

I loosely quote "" ...yes, so the risks of the vaccines are there, \*doctor proceeds to knock on wooden table 3 times\* but hopefully it should not happen"" 

I've not been able to find any information about people who've prior had pericarditis and whether their risk of getting it from the second shot of mRNA vaccines is higher, or if there's been anything even worse happened to a person in a similar situation. 

Has anyone come across small-scale or larger studies observing specifically this?

&#x200B;

\--Location: EU

\--I work from home. 

\-- Astra Z. and J&J are not recommended for people under 60 years old here.

Last time I checked, and throughout FDA history,

things like vaccines require a long, drawn-out 10 to 15 year approval process.

This is the first time in history that the Sacred Scientific Process was eschewed,

and replaced with a few-month politically-motivated process.

We can continue to use vaccines under the EUA,

as we've already been doing,

AND honor the Sacred Scientific process

of getting a proper FDA approval that takes 10 to 15 years?

I'm not aware of a single argument against my position.

is it not incumbent of the decision-makers

antivax,Live-Schedule-2570,1632732473.0,The basics everyone should know about the Covid vaccine.,"Vaccine breakout cases are expected. COVID-19 vaccines are effective and are a critical tool to bring the pandemic under control; however, no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness. Some fully vaccinated people will get sick, and some will even be hospitalized or die from COVID-19. However, there is evidence that vaccination may make illness less severe for those who are vaccinated and still get sick. The risk of infection, hospitalization, and death are all much lower in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated.

More than 181 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated as of September 20, 2021. CDC is monitoring these cases among vaccinated persons and evaluating trends in order to better understand who is at risk for severe COVID-19 following vaccine breakthrough infection. Vaccinated people have also experienced asymptomatic infections.

Current data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States offer protection against most SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United States.  As of September 20, 2021, more than 181 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

During the same time, CDC received reports from 50 U.S. states and territories of 19,136 patients with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection who were hospitalized or died.

Are side effects lesser?,"Hello all, well I have already inadvertently delayed my second dose by 2 weeks due to a rash of STREP and flu that had hit my area, and my home in particular.  Just curious if any one has spaced out their doses, and if so how long/what was your experience.  With a lot of studies coming out showing that spacing the doses might be ideal for a stronger immune response, I am curious as to the benefits.  Disclaimer.  I am in a low risk category and in a community with very little covid spread (knock on woo.  Were my circumstances different I probably would have got both shots as fast as possible.  But my main question is, does delaying the time between doses reduce the potentiality of side effects?   I have heard some physicians state they are delaying time between their children's doses to reduce the chance of myocarditis, which seen to be a bit more prominent than originally thought.   Does this hold similar for adults and general side effects?  Thank you for input.",pt46w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/pt46w9/benefits_of_delaying_my_second_dose_of_pfizer_are/,0

antivax,Kinghummingbird,1632188557.0,What more can be done about anti-vaxx subs?,"Since this is locked I doubt anyone will read this. But if it wasn’t I’d be editing this in length to discuss the bigger picture. Not because I believe people frustrated with anti-vaxxers should be tone-controlled but because I may have been too focused on one sub. Unfortunately the anti-vaxx issues are systemic and widespread. Culturally and here in Reddit. There are way too many subs tolerant of misinformation and worse- ones that promote it. Reddits administration’s complacency with it means they have the most blood on their hands. I have my suspicions about grey-area subs but I probably shouldn’t present my subjective interpretations as objective fact. 

 I do also think moderation regarding ‘civility’ should be reserved for the still all-too-common racism, sexism, and other identity-based hate speech instead of people (even harshly) critiquing peoples choice to endangering others with their reckless decisions. Anti-vaxx misinformation can kill, so not having that as the priority seems like a misdirection. 

~~is particularly problematic. I noticed a mod claims to be anti-vaxx (though also mentioned he had to sift through endless “pro-vaxx misinformation” lmao to come to that conclusion and regularly censors pro-vaccine sentiments in that sub. I think it’s particularly dangerous because the sub has an aura of neutrality. But once you start interacting you realize the whole sub in anti-vaxx echo chamber and any opposite will get downvoted into oblivion. That mod and others was insinuating natural immunity is superior and mandates were tyranny and when I tried to provide evident suggesting else-wise this I got me perma-banned lol. So for discussions it is not.~~

~~Is there any kind of Reddit oversight that is designed to interpret this kind of abuse I might be unaware of? It’s honestly even more sickening when they are wolves in sheep’s clothes. Pretending to be open-minded and interested in science. But the whole sub is political, full of pseudo-science and there’s no oversight whatsoever. People are getting seriously misinformed.~~

~~Edit: I have that particular abusive mod blocked so I wasn’t aware until now but apparently they are trying to smear me in these very comments. They apparently love lying because I never said anything about anyone being denied treatment. (I also didn’t even mention them specifically so they outted themself too) They deliberately removed my pro-vaxx comments and even citied it “false information”  as the reason so they know what they are doing.~~

She's in the US, living rural. She's started to get into conspiratorial stuff here and there in the past year- a lot of it nothing too deep or anything that she particularly grabbed onto hard. Now she's veering to anti-government, anti-science stuff. She refuses to get vaccinated for COVID-19 unless it is required to travel to Australia in the future (where I live). 

I'm kind of at a loss, because anything I've tried to reason her with falls on death ears. She gets mad when I go into detail about due and proper scientific process about any topic. I'm worried for her, and people around her. Horror stories of real people facing the consequences of saying no to COVID-19 vaccines don't mean anything to her. Proof that modern vaccines have better research and protocol for safety doesn't mean anything to her. She doesn't understand that the positive impacts of the current vaccines, even with the delta strain are still meaningful and worth considering for the good of everyone. She comes up with justifications that aren't really related such as ""obese people fill up hospitals with their comorbidities, so why should we bother if we aren't preventing those?"" 

Unfortunately I am a person who is deeply interested in science and knowing why a thing works at the most fundamental levels. I missed out on a chance to study chemistry and biology when I was younger, but still wish to pursue studying as a hobby. I keep up to date with my vaccines, and get a flu shot every winter (am vulnerable to severe flu). I don't know if I should keep trying to convince her of the good that vaccines and medical science can do, or if I need to cut my losses for the sake of my long term safety. Ideologically we will be at odds if she keeps going on her trajectory. I've been called ""paranoid"", ""weak"" and a ""sheep"" for my views. 

I know it's largely to do with our differing experiences in the US and Australia. I've had a wonderful experience with the public health care system in Australia (it's not perfect but I am ever grateful for it), whereas she has had horrible experiences with health care throughout her life in the US. I know how flawed our brains are, and how easy it is to fall into certain patterns of thinking that often become vicious cycles.

1. The governments of the world has had a history of lying or disproportionately creating scandals for ulterior motives ie Vietnam (which is true, but I argue that at this point the vaccines are bought, bug pharma is already rich, the only question is are the vaccines going to be used now for a small bit of good or not)

2. The “cost” of not taking the vaccine is extremely low. Death rates globally are equal to other common easily avoidable disasters such as driving the speed limit. “The flu kills more people every year, but you don’t take that vaccine yearly”. If the risk to himself or others were higher, he’d take it. 

EDIT: I misspoke here, the flu does not kill more people, this is false and he’s never said this. He says that the flu also kills a large amount of people every year, yet we are not taking a vaccine for that every 6 months, so why should he for covid, as the current vaccine will not be able to keep up with the new variant in 6 months anyway?

3. In Germany, they lied about the hospitals being full. I remind him the rest of the world isn’t so lucky. He disagrees but can’t provide proof.

And more. I’ll reply to the comments with what he might say back.

He is a good man, which is why it is hurting me that he believes this. Is he right? Or can anybody refute him in a way that even he can’t disagree? Please help.",peokgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/peokgr/my_husband_is_antivax_help_me_argue_with_him/,11

antivax,acrocodileatemyhead,1629979042.0,Lying to my anti-vax parents about getting vaccinated," This is a bit of a read but any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated. TL;DR at the end.  
My parents (both in their 60s) are pretty anti-covid vaccine/lockdown sceptic/Covid sceptic and both are not getting jabbed. I (23M, live at home and have no siblings) diverge from their worldview substantially and have wanted to get vaccinated when I could.   
Obviously, living in an environment where YT (or, god forbid, Bitchute) vids of vaccine sceptical or downright conspiratorial thought pieces would be played constantly makes you have questions about the vaccines but doing some research I found that benefits outweigh risks, etc.   
Sometimes it is hard to hold your own though. Both my parents don't want me to be vaccinated and have pressed upon me that I tell them that I want to get jabbed before I do so, probably to convince me otherwise. This puts quite a lot of pressure on me.  
Seems simple enough right? The issue is that they think less of people who get vaccinated, calling them sheep, snowflakes (you can tell they're boomers right?), etc. My favourite is one of them remarking that ""we are a nation of cowards"" and them watching a video yesterday arguing that Justin Trudeau was committing biological warfare with vaccine mandates (paraphrased).   
Obviously, I respect their right to an opinion, but I guess I thought it would be easier to just try and slip under the radar unnoticed because, to me, if they think that I'm lesser for deciding to protect myself/them/others then why should I have to be pressured to announce to them that I'm going to do it? I'm aware I could very much be in the wrong here though and think that this will come back to bite me.   
I had my first jab quite a few weeks ago now and am due my second in a month. The rest of my parents' family members have been jabbed and I'm due to see my aunt in a week's time where I will probably talk to her about it (I feel I can open up to her more than my parents in general).   
I think living with people so far down the anti-vaccine rabbit hole and having pro-vaccine opinions yourself and not being able to be too open about it to not blow cover has defo taken its toll on me a bit. Whenever they have a rant about it, I kind of just have to sit there and not say anything. I realise this could be disastrous if they end up in an ICU.  
A family friend came over one afternoon and started ranting about how the vaccine makes you magnetic and the ""agenda"" is about population control. This person has taken their kid out of school because of mask mandates and their fiancé was in the ICU with pneumonia-like symptoms recently (negative and positive Covid tests whilst there) and is still 100% anti-vax.   
Obviously, the issues with communication with my family don't just stem from the Covid and vaccine stuff but also personal and political issues. Both my parents are pretty conservative whereas I'm more liberal so they're stuck in another rabbit hole of Fox News, GB News, and Sky News Australia on repeat because muh mAiNsTrEaM wOkE mArXiSt media. On the personal side, I don't have a great relationship with my father. He has a very short temper and is verbally, emotionally and, on the very rare occasion, physically abusive all of which towards me and especially my mother (I have talked to her about this but she seems to tolerate it somehow, idk how it blows my mind). So essentially I find it hard/reluctant to talk to him and it's been that way since my teens. The lockdowns have exacerbated this.   
I am unsure what to do, hell, I think half of this post isn't even suitable for this sub, but I've been troubled by this for a while and just need some help. I have a great gf + friendship group which some of the issues (more vaccine-related) I have talked about with them but in terms of the next steps, I have no clue. I'm working on getting a ('proper') job so I can move out but no luck as of yet.   
Those of you who have read this far, thanks and any advice is greatly appreciated.

I am now thinking of taking the 4th doses of vaccine (Sinopharm). 2 reasons: the effectiveness of vaccine decreases significantly over time (70%) and I am working in a very contagious environment. However, I am worried:

1) Is mixing the vaccines safe? (Astra is a vector vaccine, Moderna is a mRNA and Sinopharm is inactive vaccine). My point here is that mixing different types would likely increase my immune response and my protection???

That's unpopular here on Reddit but that's my background.

Most of the small group is against the vaccinations.  I don't know why.  They are fiercely pro-life, to a fault even.  They believe in the sanctity of life.  No elderly euthanasia either.  Yet, no matter what proofs there are of vaccines saving lives they don't want to vaccinate.  Shouldn't they want to have something to save lives, especially those of children?  Shouldn't they be protecting the innocent children from death?  And yes, there have been children dying from it, even just from school coming back in session, so I call BS on how little COVID can affect children.

Then eventually boosters will help.  Which they won't get either, even if effectiveness goes back over 90%.

So today I get a message on our group text that is asking for prayer about one of the group members daughters having to get the vaccine in NURSING SCHOOL and wanting to get a religious exemption.  To become a nurse and not even want to possibly save more lives.  Shouldn't even ONE life be worth it?  To reduce the possibility of spread?  Are they just so selfish and lack the ability to recognize ""self-sacrifice""?  They are so scared of a 1e-6 range of serious side effects probability that they can't take that risk to help others???

It's mind boggling.  You can resist being forced into it, but if you are TRULY pro-life then do it voluntarily to save lives.  Everything shows, even now with Delta, that the vaccines have great benefit.  So there's a chance of severe reaction...microscopic compared to the payoff of reducing the spread of a deadly disease.  Don't call yourself pro-life and then do nothing to reduce the spread of a deadly disease.",p8c19t,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/p8c19t/a_rant_why_are_ostensibly_prolife_people_antivaxx/,15

antivax,ualsw1,1629384127.0,I’m Planning To Tell My Parents I’m Taking The Covid-19 Vaccine.,"*(Repost from r/foxbrain)* 

  I’m a teenager living with my parents, and I’m legally able to to take the Covid vaccine without their permission. Classes at my local Community College is starting soon, and they have a vaccine clinic (walk-in/schedule), and I plan to take it when school starts. 

  As for my parents, right now they think the vaccine doesn’t work against the virus (especially the Delta Variant), and that it’s only slightly effective. And, they believe, as long as they are healthy (my immediate family is on a Keto Diet, along with exercising every morning for an hour, fast for a few days, little processed foods, and try to buy from local farms as much as possible), they think they don’t need the vaccine, and only people who might need the vaccine are people who aren’t healthy. They also do not want to take the vaccine because of the “unknown long term risks” of taking it (but they say it’s it’s not highly effective against Covid/very low risk?), and they don’t trust the pharmaceutical and government. They also believe scientists that are anti-mask/anti Covid vaccine are being silenced on social media, And, if one of us were were to take the vaccine, it would be either a threat to my life or their life because I would spread the variant to them, and my dad specifically has said a month ago that if one of us decide to take the vaccine, we should do it as a family. 

  The reason why I plan on telling them that I’ll get the vaccine is because I don’t want to go behind their back and lie to them and risk breaking their trust, or keep it a secret until they (maybe) want to get the vaccine, which would make them pissed because I didn’t tell them earlier, and they might be really suspicious of me/not trust me after the fact. 

  Although I am getting the vaccine to receive more protect from Covid and I am scared of Covid, I plan to tell them “I’m going to to get the vaccine because I see New York and other countries, like France, pushing vaccine passports, so I’m going to get it just in case our area implements something similar.” Do you have have any other methods in which I can tell them, or should I just do it without telling them at all?",p7g662,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/p7g662/im_planning_to_tell_my_parents_im_taking_the/,13

I don't think there's any hope of getting through to his family, partly because I don't have much contact with them. But I hope to pursuade him to have the vaccine, how do I approach the subject with him to maximise the chances he gets the vaccine?

His family (mainly his mother and grandmother) have always been antivaxxers. We have been lifelong friends and were one of the first kids to be offered the MMR vaccine when a British doctor made headlines saying it causes autism. He lost his medical licences and has since been debunked, I'm sure you all know the story. But it's where the ""vaccines cause autism"" rhetoric comes from. Anyway, when our parents were discussing it, my mother told his mother I was getting my vaccines. Tom was an only child and she was very protective of him (and spolit Tom a bit tbh- turned into a nice guy though). After I had mine, she agreed to get his first one done. Unfortunately according to her, tom was ""never the same"" exactly what evidence for this she had I have no idea. He was completely normal and uninjured. I'm speculating but I think he cried when the nurse put the needle in and she threw a hissy fit. Anyway, that was the last vaccine tom was ever given. 

A few years ago he rejected a chance to come backpacking with me for ""family reasons"", but only after he (or his mum) worked out he would need some vaccinations (malaria / rabies / tropical diseases etc.) His grandmother is twice as bad, she's knee deep in daily mail pseudo science, constantly castrophising anything which happens to her only grandchild. They've tried to protect him from everything and ended up damaging him. 

He bought a house to live in, but ended up moving back with his parents within 3 months, due to their insatiable worrying and nagging. ""What happens if there's a break in"" ""what happens if your killed"" ""what happens if X y or z"". All of these things are ludicrous, especially as he is 25 years old and moved to a bungalow at the bottom of their garden!!! 

I felt sorry for him when I asked about the covid vaccine and what he thought of it. It seemed pretty clear he was scared of it and what would happen if he took it. He couldn't tell me what exactly he was scared of, or why. Until grandma chimed in ""well I'm not taking it, they want me to take it I won't take it etc."" Gasping in horror as she thought about the prospect. 

I had hoped his new gf would talk some sense into him, after all she is a frontline healthcare worker, in an FUCKING NURSING HOME!! But no, she's the biggest antivaxxer of the lot. Her boss tried telling her she needed to have it to protect the old people or she'll get fired, so she got apoplecticly mad and told her boss to fuck off. This only entrenched her in her beliefs. When I asked her why, she came up with a personal anecdote of two old people living at home, the wife had covid-19 but survived and the husband never caught it. She had tested them both over a period of a couple of weeks, and he never tested positive. I didn't see the relavence of this story in relation to covid vaccines. 

It seems they all have some half-baked ideas about vaccine injury and whether Covid is really such a big deal. Which again, is strange because during the lockdown they followed lockdown rules to the letter and invented some more of their own. In fact they were arguably paralysed by fear from covid-19, and are now applying to same castrophising mentality to the covid vaccine. 

Is there anything I can do to change his mind, or what would you do/ say in this situation?

Update: they have had the vaccine. I think seeing others get it and being ok helped their decision, although I didn't ask. Thanks for your help guys!",oeznw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/oeznw9/bestfriend_is_an_antivaxxer_how_do_i_help_them/,51

id_news,PHealthy,1749727652.0,"Vaccine Advice, Vandalized","Everyone will have heard by now about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s abrupt decision to fire the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the CDC. That's seventeeen people let go all at once, which needless to say is something that no one's tried before. But the reasoning behind it is exactly as transparent as it looks like, and Kennedy himself explained it in the Wall Street Journal. He wants control.

Without kicking the entire ACIP structure over, he and the Trump Administration would not have a majority of their own appointees on this committee until near the end of Trump's term. Fixed that! Now they'll all be hand-picked. And it's been reported today that Kennedy is going to replace the entire committee within the next week or so, because the next scheduled meeting is on June 25th. Needless to say, that completely shortcuts the usual vetting process, and it is as open as a question can be about who he will be able to find to serve under these conditions. Kennedy himself has made all the mouth noises about finding competent, qualified people, but he also has said that the reason he fired everyone was that they were too beholden to the drug industry in the first place. Which is not a confidence-building argument.

But I have no confidence in the man at all, other than in him bulldozing along to get to his desired results, damn the evidence and all rules that might stand in the way. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is hostile towards vaccines. He is not carefully considering the evidence, he is not a brave outside-the-box truthteller about them: he hates vaccines. He has made tens of millions of dollars by loudly, publicly hating vaccines and blaming them for all kinds of health problems, and he is absolutely not going to stop now. Here's the greatest chance of his life to do more damage to the vaccination schedules than he has ever been able to do before, and by God he is not going to let that slip past.

So we'll see who he finds, but I make the following prediction confidently: the great majority of the new ACIP will share most of RFK Jr.'s views, and they will have meeting after meeting where they chip away at the current vaccine recommendations. It will all be covered in banners of Freedom and Parental Choice and Doing Your Own Research, but the result will be what Kennedy has been wanting for years and years: the undermining of the entire childhood vaccination schedule. This ignorant, willful man and his ignorant, willful President are going to have yet more blood on their hands, because this demolition of the US vaccination system, if accomplished, will absolutely lead to more illness, suffering, and death.

id_news,ShonenAkbar,1747869047.0,"Scabies on the Rise Worldwide, Even in High-Income Countries","Eight years after the World Health Organization (WHO) classified scabies as a neglected tropical disease, it continues to pose a global public health challenge, particularly among children, institutionalized individuals, and migrant populations. This warning was issued by Claire Fuller, MD, consultant dermatologist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London, England; current chair of the International Foundation for Dermatology; and co-founder of the International Alliances of Scabies and Global Health Dermatology. She spoke during a session at The World Congress of Pediatric Dermatology (WCPD) 2025 Annual Meeting, held recently in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. It affects more than 130 million people worldwide at any given time and is estimated to contribute to more than 1.5 million years lived with disability globally.

“This is a significant burden, especially in tropical regions, with considerable costs for both healthcare systems and individuals who do not have access to reimbursed care,” said Fuller.

She emphasized that scabies could have a profound impact on overall health, leading to stigma, social isolation, and sleep disruption. Beyond these effects, skin barrier damage caused by scabies can facilitate secondary bacterial infections, particularly impetigo, which may lead to sepsis and immunological complications, including post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. “Mortality rates can reach 5%-10% in some settings. The risk of death is not something most people associate with scabies,” she noted.

Global Prevalence and Rising Trends

A systematic review of 43 cross-sectional studies conducted between 2014 and 2022 in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands revealed alarmingly high scabies prevalence rates in children younger than 20 years. For example, prevalence reached 79.6% in Indonesian boarding schools and 54.3% in communities in the Solomon Islands.

In Europe, scabies cases have also been on the rise. In Spain, a 23% increase in diagnoses was reported between 2014 and 2019, with further escalation noted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany, prescriptions for scabies treatment rose from 59,000 in 2007 to 142,000 in 2015, and the number of diagnoses increased ninefold between 2009 and 2018, particularly among adolescents and young adults. In England, the British Association of Dermatologists reported an “unusual” rise in 2024, with an incidence rate that tripled compared with the previous 5-year average (from 1 to 3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants).

The trend is not limited to high-income countries. In Latin America, a study conducted in Bogotá, Colombia, found scabies in 1% of more than 2400 children aged 1-6 years between 2009 and 2011. In Argentina, scabies ranked as the fourth most common infectious skin disease and the most prevalent parasitic skin disease among children younger than 15 years who are treated in emergency departments. In Brazil, an outbreak in Camboriú, a popular beach resort, led to more than 40 reported cases in June 2024 and prompted the temporary closure of local schools, according to media reports.

Concern Over Permethrin Resistance

In communities where scabies prevalence exceeds 10%, mass drug administration (MDA) has proven highly effective, according to a 2019 WHO-convened expert meeting. The current recommendation for MDA includes two doses of oral ivermectin (200 mcg/kg body weight) or, alternatively, 5% permethrin cream when ivermectin is contraindicated or unavailable.

A recent example comes from Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where MDA led to a reduction in scabies prevalence from 39.6% to 19.2%, as reported by the Rohingya Refugee Response. However, experts noted that annual repetition of this intervention is necessary to prevent reinfestation and maintain control.

One major advantage of ivermectin is its dual role in treating soil-transmitted helminth infections, allowing for integration into broader public health campaigns. “It’s difficult to maintain enthusiasm for routine ivermectin use. But when people have scabies, they return for treatment because the itching stops — this improves compliance with MDA,” explained Fuller.

Ivermectin in Individual Treatment

For individual treatment, 5% permethrin remains the recommended first-line therapy in most guidelines. However, oral ivermectin is increasingly being considered as a first-choice option due to its ease of administration, lower risk of incorrect application, and concerns about emerging resistance to permethrin, according to Ramiro Cano, MD, dermatologist at the Department of Dermatology of Hospital Alemán, Buenos Aires, and board member of the Pediatric Dermatology Society for Latin America.

Cano noted that oral ivermectin or permethrin can be used as first-line therapy in children and adolescents weighing at least 15 kg, and there is growing evidence supporting the safety of oral ivermectin in infants less than 15 kg, as well as the use of 5% permethrin in infants younger than 2 months, under clinical supervision.

Permethrin Resistance

The question of permethrin resistance remains debated. While some experts attribute treatment failures to poor compliance or reinfection, Cano highlighted that in vitro and epidemiologic evidence does suggest increasing mite resistance. Risk factors include limited mobility, immunosuppression, and prior use of topical corticosteroids.

Alternative treatment strategies include:

Oral or topical ivermectin
Combination therapy with ivermectin and permethrin
Benzyl benzoate (10%-25%), either alone or in combination with ivermectin.
“Benzyl benzoate is a promising option because there is no current evidence of mite resistance, and it is effective in treatment-resistant cases,” Cano said.

New Agents on the Horizon

New therapies are under investigation. Moxidectin, a long-acting drug from the same family as ivermectin, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for onchocerciasis and is being evaluated for scabies. With a longer half-life than ivermectin, it could offer effective treatment with a single dose.

In October 2024, Medicines Development for Global Health announced the launch of a Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-dose moxidectin in scabies treatment. The trial includes 200 participants from the United States, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and El Salvador.

Diagnostic and Treatment Challenge

Speaking to Medscape’s Spanish edition, Cristina Galván Casas, MD, a dermatologist based in Madrid, Spain, vice chair of the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies, and founder of the Dermalawi project for treating scabies and other neglected dermatologic diseases in rural Malawi, stated, “Scabies is giving us headaches” — not only in low-resource settings but also in regions with lower prevalence, such as Latin America.

“One of the most difficult aspects is related to the disease’s pathophysiology,” she explained. “The itching and thickened skin lesions are not caused directly by the mite burrowing into the skin but are instead the result of an immune response mounted by the body against the mite.”

This delayed hypersensitivity reaction typically takes 3-6 weeks to manifest, meaning the affected individual may be unaware they are infected for an extended period — during which time they remain contagious. “This window allows the infestation to spread within households before the primary case is even recognized,” Galván Casas noted.

Because of this delay, tracing close contacts from the 1-2 months prior to symptom onset is difficult. Limited access to rapid treatment further complicates containment and promotes reinfestation within family units. “When case numbers rise, the asymptomatic transmission circle — those unknowingly infected — expands rapidly. The larger the circle, the harder it becomes to ensure everyone receives effective treatment,” she added.

Galván Casas also emphasized the challenge posed by immunosenescent older adults and immunosuppressed individuals, who are less able to mount an immune response to scabies. As a result, they often develop more severe forms of the disease and act as super-spreaders. This issue is amplified by aging populations and the growing number of people on immunosuppressive therapies.

“Long-term care facilities and hospitals that serve these patients must remain vigilant,” she said, noting the importance of awareness among healthcare professionals managing patients on immunosuppressants.

Another major challenge is the lack of an ideal treatment. “Oral ivermectin is the most convenient option,” Galván Casas explained, “but it doesn’t kill the mite eggs, which hatch a few days after administration. Like other scabicidal agents, it may also be contributing to drug resistance.”

Topical treatments — though widely used — present additional challenges. “These formulations can be irritating, must be applied thoroughly over the entire body (excluding the scalp in adults), and need to remain on the skin without washing for several hours. Application often needs to be repeated.”

She also pointed out that in countries like Spain, cost remains a barrier, even when treatments are partially reimbursed. “Entire families often require treatment across multiple cycles, which makes it expensive and burdensome,” she said.

What is needed, Galván Casas concluded, is a long-acting oral drug that is effective against mite eggs, safe, and affordable for both patients and their close contacts. “Unfortunately, research into scabies is still limited, likely because it’s not seen as a commercially profitable area.”",1ksbzvy,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/scabies-rise-worldwide-even-high-income-countries-2025a1000ccw?ecd=soc_tw_250519_mscpedt_news_mdscp_&icd=login_success_email_match_fpf,18

id_news,PHealthy,1745595601.0,Modeling Reemergence of Vaccine-Eliminated Infectious Diseases Under Declining Vaccination in the US,"Key Points

**Question**  How will declining childhood vaccination rates affect the risk of outbreaks and reemergence of previously eliminated infectious diseases in the US?

**Findings**  At current state-level vaccination rates, measles may become endemic again; increasing vaccine coverage would prevent this. Under a 50% decline in childhood vaccination in the US, the simulation model predicted 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million rubella cases, 4.3 million poliomyelitis cases, 197 diphtheria cases, 10.3 million hospitalizations, and 159 200 deaths.

**Meaning**  Childhood vaccination at a high coverage level is needed to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases and their infection-related complications in the US.

Abstract

**Importance**  Widespread childhood vaccination has eliminated many infectious diseases in the US. However, vaccination rates are declining, and there are ongoing policy debates to reduce the childhood vaccine schedule, which may risk reemergence of previously eliminated infectious diseases.

**Objective**  To estimate the number of cases and complications in the US under scenarios of declining childhood vaccination for measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  A simulation model was used to assess the importation and dynamic spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases across 50 US states and the District of Columbia. The model was parameterized with data on area-specific estimates for demography, population immunity, and infectious disease importation risk. The model evaluated scenarios with different vaccination rates over a 25-year period. Inputs for current childhood vaccination rates were based on 2004-2023 data.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  The primary outcomes were estimated cases of measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria in the US. The secondary outcomes were estimated rates of infection-related complications (postmeasles neurological sequelae, congenital rubella syndrome, paralytic poliomyelitis, hospitalization, and death) and the probability and timing for an infection to reestablish endemicity.

**Results**  At current state-level vaccination rates, the simulation model predicts measles may reestablish endemicity (83% of simulations; mean time of 20.9 years) with an estimated 851 300 cases (95% uncertainty interval \[UI\], 381 300 to 1.3 million cases) over 25 years. Under a scenario with a 10% decline in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination, the model estimates 11.1 million (95% UI, 10.1-12.1 million) cases of measles over 25 years, whereas the model estimates only 5800 cases (95% UI, 3100-19 400 cases) with a 5% increase in MMR vaccination. Other vaccine-preventable diseases are unlikely to reestablish endemicity under current levels of vaccination. If routine childhood vaccination declined by 50%, the model predicts 51.2 million (95% UI, 49.7-52.5 million) cases of measles over a 25-year period, 9.9 million (95% UI, 6.4-13.0 million) cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases (95% UI, 4 cases to 21.5 million cases) of poliomyelitis, and 197 cases (95% UI, 1-1000 cases) of diphtheria. Under this scenario, the model predicts 51 200 cases (95% UI, 49 600-52 600 cases) with postmeasles neurological sequelae, 10 700 cases (95% UI, 6700-14 600 cases) of congenital rubella syndrome, 5400 cases (95% UI, 0-26 300 cases) of paralytic poliomyelitis, 10.3 million hospitalizations (95% UI, 9.9-10.5 million hospitalizations), and 159 200 deaths (95% UI, 151 200-164 700 deaths). In this scenario, measles became endemic at 4.9 years (95% UI, 4.3-5.6 years) and rubella became endemic at 18.1 years (95% UI, 17.0-19.6 years), whereas poliovirus returned to endemic levels in about half of simulations (56%) at an estimated 19.6 years (95% UI, 14.0-24.7 years). There was large variation across the US population.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  Based on estimates from this modeling study, declining childhood vaccination rates will increase the frequency and size of outbreaks of previously eliminated vaccine-preventable infections, eventually leading to their return to endemic levels. The timing and critical threshold for returning to endemicity will differ substantially by disease, with measles likely to be the first to return to endemic levels and may occur even under current vaccination levels without improved vaccine coverage and public health response. These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US.",1k7o1r2,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361,39

id_news,shallah,1745234991.0,Shared from Bing: N.J.’s herd immunity from measles is gone. Get your kids vaccinated ...,"ublic health experts are recommending that infants aged 6 to 11 months get an early dose of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccination, also known as the MMR vaccine, in addition to the two shots they get in early childhood

Currently, public health guidelines only recommend an early additional MMR dose for infants traveling internationally.

However, New Jersey has lost its herd immunity, putting unvaccinated people, especially children, more at risk — mirroring a trend across the United States as vaccination coverage wanes and outbreaks increase, including two confirmed deaths from measles and one under investigation.

 
In response to what they call “a growing domestic hazard,” a group of experts is calling for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to expand the recommendation of an early additional MMR dose for infants aged 6 to 11 months traveling to locations in the U.S. with measles outbreaks.

 

Historically, unvaccinated children returning from international travel to regions where measles remains endemic have been the biggest source of U.S. measles cases.

 outbreaks, coupled with low vaccination rates, signal a growing domestic hazard,” wrote authors of the article “Revising U.S. MMR Vaccine Recommendations Amid Changing Domestic Risks” in JAMA, a peer-reviewed general medical journal.

The recommendation comes at a time of increased risk in New Jersey, where the chance of catching measles is higher now than it was five years ago.

 , as a state we have dipped below that herd immunity,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Kaitlan Baston during an April 7 Assembly Budget Committee hearing on the fiscal year 2026 budget.

“We are very concerned that this is going to become a very big issue within the next five years,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park, D-Bergen, during the hearing.

These changes aim to protect vulnerable populations and prevent further spread of the disease in our community.

 

Updated MMR Vaccination Recommendations:

Infants (6 to 11 months):

One early dose of the MMR vaccine is now recommended.
These children should continue with the standard Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) schedule:
A second dose at 12 through 15 months
A final dose at 4 through 6 years


Children (12 months and older):

Unvaccinated children should receive one dose of the MMR vaccine immediately and a second dose at least 28 days later.
Children who have received one dose should receive their second dose now, if at least 28 days have passed since the first.


Teens and Adults Without Evidence of Immunity:

Receive the first dose of MMR vaccine immediately, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later.


Adults Born Between 1957 and 1968:

If only vaccinated with an older version of the MMR vaccine: receive one dose of the current live-attenuated MMR vaccine now, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later.
If already received one dose of the current MMR vaccine: receive a second dose immediately (at least 28 days after the first).


Adults Born After 1968 Who Have Received One Dose:

Receive the second dose of the current MMR vaccine immediately (at least 28 days after the first dose).


MMR Vaccine Is Not Recommended For:

Adults born before 1957
Pregnant women
Individuals with severe immunodeficiency*


*consult with your healthcare provider for further guidance

MMR vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent measles, a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications. With cases rising locally, these updated guidelines aim to ensure rapid protection for those at highest risk.

 

“We urge residents to review their vaccination history and ensure they and their children are protected,” said Katherine Wells, Director of Lubbock Public Health. “Vaccination is the best defense against measles, especially in the face of an active outbreak.”

 

Lubbock Public Health is currently offering walk-in vaccine clinics on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00 am -3:00 pm and on Saturday from Noon to 3:00 pm. These hours will be expanded if demand for the vaccine at the department increases.

id_news,shallah,1744786429.0,"Large number of measles cases being missed, CDC says: talking with families, they may mention prior cases that have recovered and never received testing, other families that may have cases and never had sought treatment","The West Texas outbreak has been centered in a local Mennonite community. Underreported measles cases are not uncommon for close-knit communities where people are less likely to see a doctor when they are sick, he said.

""We do think there is under-testing, and therefore under-diagnosis and underreporting, which leads to a smaller denominator than likely,"" said Sugerman. 

More than 90% of current cases have been linked to the outbreak around Texas and neighboring states, he said. Genetic sequencing suggests that the Texas outbreak is also linked to outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, among members of the ""same close-knit community.""

Texas is pulling resources and staff from other parts of its health department to respond to the measles outbreak. The CDC is now ""scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,"" Sugerman said.


""There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas. There are funding limitations in light of COVID-19 funding dissipating,"" he said.

The CDC previously deployed a team of 15 to Texas last month to aid in the response. That team's deployment ended on April 1, the same day Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s massive layoffs rolled out at the CDC and other health agencies.

CDC's original team included support from the agency's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, for helping health care facilities find ways to stop the spread of the highly contagious virus through improved ventilation, Sugerman said. 

NIOSH was among the agencies that was largely eliminated by Kennedy's layoffs. CBS News previously reported that multiple staff tasked to the CDC's measles response had been laid off.

A new team of seven CDC responders are being deployed to Texas this week, Sugerman said.


Sugerman said the CDC is also exploring other ways to scale up the measles response, including expanding testing through wastewater surveillance for the virus in Texas and New Mexico. During COVID-19, the CDC worked with health departments to collect samples from sewer systems to spot undetected spread of the virus.

Health officials have worried that the failure to stop ongoing outbreaks of measles could put the U.S. on track to officially lose its status of having eliminated endemic community spread of the virus. Sugerman said that threshold could be crossed on January 20 next year.

""We will be tracking duration, working closely with our state and local partners to ensure we don't cross the 12-month threshold and preserve our elimination status with ongoing spring and summer travel and congregate events,"" said Sugerman.

Measles can be especially dangerous during pregnancy or early infancy, but there have been no stillbirths or miscarriages reported in the outbreak so far, he said. But health officials have dealt with ""complicated exposures in hospitals"" after pregnant women came to the hospital. There has also been one case of congenital measles — a newborn who contracted the virus from their mother. That child has recovered, he said.

""A significant risk in pregnant women that can develop measles and go on to have preterm labor, complicated deliveries, and then infants that that can have negative outcomes,"" he said.",1k0e549,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-missed-in-texas-outbreak-cdc-says/,64

Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we employ an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. The model allows us to simulate various scenarios to understand how epidemic spreading can be affected by misinformation spreading through one particular social media platform. Using this model, we compare a worst-case scenario, in which individuals become misinformed after a single exposure to low-credibility content, to a best-case scenario where the population is highly resilient to misinformation. We estimate the additional portion of the U.S. population that would become infected over the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in the worst-case scenario. This work can provide policymakers with insights about the potential harms of exposure to online vaccine misinformation.",1jume1g,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44260-025-00038-y,6

id_news,Least-Plantain973,1743716871.0,How Kennedy is already weakening America's childhood vaccine system,"The Department of Health and Human Services cut $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children, forcing public health departments to lay off staff and cancel clinics.

April 4, 2025, 8:11 AM GMT+13
Last week, Jackie Griffith showed up at her office at the Collin County Health Care Clinic in north Texas ready to start her day — answering emails from local doctors before heading to a nearby high school to go over the latest vaccine record requirements. 

Instead, the 60-year-old registered nurse was called into her director’s office and told to pack up her belongings. The federal government had yanked funding, she learned, and her position — supporting vaccination efforts for uninsured children through a network of more than 60 providers — was gone. 

Across the country in New Hampshire, Kayla Hogan, 27, was hearing the same. She worked for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, onboarding clinics and hospitals into a data system that would help them administer free childhood vaccines. Now that project was in jeopardy, threatening the process of getting children vaccinated.  

The cuts that ensnared Griffith, Hogan and many others whose work touches vaccines in dozens of states were part of $11.4 billion in funds that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services pulled back from state and community health departments last week, included in the larger slashing of federal government under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. More than $2 billion was taken from “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” grants, which support the delivery of vaccines to children whose families may not be able to afford them,  according to a list HHS published.  

Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist with a well-documented history of promoting misinformation, promised ahead of his confirmation as HHS secretary that he would not take away vaccines. Since taking office, however, he has repeatedly downplayed the severity of measles currently sweeping the country — outbreaks that have hospitalized scores of children and left at least two dead. He has publicly pushed unproven treatments, including vitamin A regimens that have reportedly sickened children, and offered limp public support for vaccines themselves — despite vaccines offering the safest, most effective way to prevent many infectious diseases. Under his leadership, HHS has overseen mass firings across federal health agencies, including staff responsible for outbreak response and vaccine access; canceled or postponed meetings of independent vaccine advisory committees; and ended vaccine education campaigns.  

The funding cuts under his watch go further, turning his rhetoric into reality and weakening the systems that deliver lifesaving preventative care. Through sweeping reductions to state and local health agencies, the new administration is quietly dismantling the fragile, interconnected infrastructure that moves childhood vaccines from the federal government to providers and, ultimately, to children.  

The cuts have hit health departments and medical providers, the data systems that track immunizations and the nonprofit coalitions that make the whole system run. They come at a moment when public health officials and advocates say that despite federal assurances, childhood vaccines are under attack. 

“It will impact every aspect of immunization: community outreach, education, health fairs, mobile clinics and public health nurses,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. “It’s catastrophic.” 

Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., sued HHS and Kennedy this week over the funding takebacks. 

HHS did not respond to a request for comment.  

Ostensibly, the federal cuts were aimed at Covid-era projects that were no longer necessary. 

“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the department’s director of communications, Andrew Nixon, said last week. 

While an early wave of Covid funding focused on testing, vaccines and addressing health disparities, as the pandemic waned, state health departments were allowed to shift that money to other underfunded programs — including grants that support childhood vaccinations. 

Those grants supplement Vaccines for Children, a federal entitlement program established by Congress in 1994 in response to a deadly measles epidemic, which remains intact. But its successful operation relies on the “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” funding, which received a temporary boost from reallocated Covid dollars — until that money was pulled back last week.  

Now, the cuts have forced public health departments across the country to lay off staff, cancel vaccine clinics, shut down education and outreach programs, and halt critical physical and virtual infrastructure upgrades, according to news reports, declarations filed in the federal lawsuit against HHS and results from a survey conducted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials and shared with NBC News. 

In Dallas County, Texas, the health director said the cuts compelled the cancellation of 50 community vaccination events — including many in schools with low measles vaccination rates amid a rising outbreak.  

In Minnesota, the Health Department announced it would lay off 170 employees after losing more than $220 million in federal funds. Among the casualties is the state’s immunization registry, which will no longer be upgraded — leaving Minnesota with one of the most outdated tracking systems in the country. 

In California, the Health Department said in a federal filing that it would be unable to provide childhood vaccines, including for measles, to millions of children, roughly half of the state’s youth. 

And in Washington state, the Health Department announced that in response to $20 million in grant cuts targeting immunization programs, it would furlough or lay off 46 workers and suspend its mobile clinic operation, known as the Care-a-Van. The 104 canceled clinics were expected to administer 2,000 vaccines to vulnerable kids, including those in rural areas and homeless populations. 

“We’re just going to have to think strategically about how we reach those really difficult-to-reach populations,” Lacy Fehrenbach, Washington’s chief of prevention, said at a media briefing. 

The National Association of County and City Health Officials survey captured further impacts: A department in Ohio said it plans to halt training on vaccine hesitancy. One in Indiana will lose two nurses who travel to schools to vaccinate children, so parents don’t have to miss work. A Texas agency will not be able to replace old equipment as planned. 

The cuts also threaten a less visible but critical part of the vaccine infrastructure: the data systems that public health departments use to record and share immunizations. Vaccines for Children relies on these systems to order doses, approve and track distribution, and monitor safety. 

Health departments in Pennsylvania and elsewhere said in declarations filed in the federal case that the cuts would prevent them from operating or upgrading these systems, forcing states to rely on outdated, cumbersome platforms. Poor data systems can leave parents and providers without access to vaccination records and increase the risk of missed or duplicate doses. 

Rebecca Coyle, executive director of the American Immunization Registry Association, noted that these systems were born out of a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of 89 children in the early 1990s, including an 11-year-old girl who died after being denied a vaccine — despite her father’s efforts to get her immunized — because the clinic couldn’t locate the right records. 

While much attention is given to parents who hesitate or outright refuse to vaccinate, it is the children without access to vaccines who offer the clearest path to closing immunity gaps, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. 

“The way we get from 60% of our population vaccinated to over 95% is by focusing on people who, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty getting vaccinated,” he said. “That includes the homeless, low-income individuals, and people without a primary care provider.” 

These funding cuts, Benjamin said, degraded the ability to reach those populations “literally overnight.” 

Immunization coalitions — nonprofits that connect public health departments with communities to improve vaccination rates — play a key role, too. Now their work mostly supported by state and federal dollars is at risk. 

The cuts caused “immense damage” to Indiana’s Immunization Coalition, according to its executive director, Lisa Robertson, who said in a statement that its budget — funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via the state Health Department — was slashed entirely for this year and reduced by 75% for the next fiscal year. 

“The clawback of funds will have real-life consequences,” Robertson said. ",1jqva6s,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188,320

Rate rose for each additional UMC
Of 870,888 adults, 1,403 were hospitalized for flu at least once (1.2 per 1,000 person-years). Relative to those without CHF, the rate of flu-related hospitalization was highest for patients with CHF (13.0 per 1,000 person-years; adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 4.2), followed by COPD (4.0) and blood disorders (3.6), compared with those without the specific UMC.

Among those with varying types and number of UMCs, if vaccination prevalence had been lower than observed, influenza-associated hospitalization rates would have been higher.
The rate also increased with each additional UMC, compared with those with no UMCs (aRR for 1, 3.4; 2, 8.1; 3, 14.2; and 4 or more, 24.0). The effect of UMCs on hospitalizations for flu was higher when not mediated by vaccination status; for those with four or more UMCs versus no UMCs, rates were about 60% higher.

""Among those with varying types and number of UMCs, if vaccination prevalence had been lower than observed, influenza-associated hospitalization rates would have been higher,"" the study authors wrote. ""These findings highlight the importance of preventive medical care and annual influenza vaccination in reducing influenza-associated hospitalizations, particularly for individuals at high-risk.""

The denominator for deaths similarly in the vaccinated column seems to have around 2-3000 fewer persons than cases.

I assume that it must be that the way that states reported their data perhaps led to this discrepancy (my best guess that I think is probably correct is that states reported their death data earlier in the week) but the data guide is a little unclear.

She’s used LinkedIn, Indeed, Lensa, beBee, and applies directly through portals like MD Anderson, LSU Health, and Johns Hopkins. She also has a work permit with no restrictions.

Her background:

* MPH coursework: epidemiology, biostats, health policy, data analysis, Python
* Practicum in infectious disease (private LLC)
* Volunteering: teaching health topics to middle schoolers

She doesn’t have publications or conference presentations, like her peers, since her medical school emphasized residency and clinical training rather than research. She *does* have a lot of hands-on clinical experience.

publichealth,cookieelle,1757435376.0,5.5 years tracking COVID variants - watching my field get dismantled has broken me,"I’ve been hesitant to talk publicly about my experience, but I think it’s important for people to understand what’s happening to public health professionals right now. We’re not just statistics or bureaucrats, we’re real people who chose this work because we genuinely care about protecting communities. I’m sharing my story because I want others going through similar struggles to know they’re not alone, and I hope it might help the public understand the human cost of what we’re losing when we undervalue science and public health expertise.

I’m currently on medical leave from my primary role as a public health professional, where I track SARS-CoV-2, including the mutational changes that give rise to new circulating variants. This is work I have been dedicated to since the pandemic was first declared in 2020.

During my tenure as an epidemiologist and bioinformatician for the Kentucky Public Health Laboratory, I was privileged to join over 1,800 scientists in the CDC’s SPHERES initiative (SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology, and Surveillance). Together, we revolutionized pandemic response through real-time genomic analysis, fundamentally transforming how we understand and respond to emerging threats.

While serving Kentucky’s state government, one of my most significant accomplishments was helping establish a three-person team that successfully implemented next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to understand SARS-CoV-2’s genomic epidemiology across the commonwealth. Many Kentuckians may recall Governor Beshear’s 2021 announcement that the Alpha variant had been detected in Kentucky. This moment remains particularly vivid in my memory because I was the scientist who first identified Alpha’s arrival and communicated this critical finding to leadership. Using Nextstrain and whole-genome analysis, I could pinpoint which variants were circulating throughout Kentucky.

This was the essence of SPHERES: detecting variants like Alpha, Delta, and Omicron in real time, providing the intelligence necessary for informed public health action.

My work gained sufficient recognition that I was recruited by the Washington State Department of Health as a bioinformatician to continue this vital surveillance. Among my notable early contributions were our variant severity studies, where we estimated the severity risks of different variants using hospitalization data. We also analyzed vaccine effectiveness, demonstrating that full vaccination protected against severe disease and significantly reduced hospitalization risk following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In 2022, I was one of three principal investigators who collaboratively wrote the grant proposal for the Pathogen Genomics Center of Excellence. We were among one of five sites nationwide to receive this prestigious award, which enabled us to establish the Northwest Pathogen Genomics Center of Excellence. Through this center, I continue monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State’s wastewater surveillance system.

Yet despite my profound love for this work and my unwavering belief in its importance, I find myself on medical leave. The current state of our field and the shifting public perception of those we serve has inflicted deep trauma and moral injury. I’m traumatically experiencing first-hand my fields of public health and science being gutted and I’m hopeless to do anything about it, even as we had accomplished unprecedented advances during the pandemic. We transformed surveillance methodologies, revolutionized outbreak investigations, and fundamentally reimagined disease intelligence.

The CDC, once our North Star that guided state public health professionals like myself in standardizing and implementing nationwide protocols, has become unreliable. It now stands as a shadow of its former excellence. It feels like losing a mentor whose wisdom once illuminated our path forward.

Most heartbreaking is watching the very people whose health and safety I’ve devoted my career to protecting question and reject the tools designed to safeguard them. The rise in vaccine skepticism has reached such proportions that preventable diseases are resurging, threatening the hard-won victories of decades past.

The pervasive ideology that positions science and public health as adversaries rather than allies has taken hold with such tenacity that it fractures something fundamental within me. When those entrusted with protecting our nation’s health perpetuate perspectives that lead people to reject the very interventions that could save their lives, the moral weight becomes unbearable. This is not merely professional disappointment but grief for a shared commitment to truth and collective wellbeing that seems to be slipping away, leaving those of us who remain steadfast in our mission to wonder how we might rebuild what has been lost.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Watching how this is affecting my colleagues has been equally heartbreaking. I see brilliant, dedicated scientists and public health professionals questioning whether their work matters anymore. I see the exhaustion in their eyes and hear it in their voices as they try to continue finding meaning in the work they do. I see people who’ve devoted their careers to protecting communities now wondering if they should leave the field entirely. The collective trauma and demoralization across our profession is staggering.

It’s hard, but I’m not giving up. 

TL;DR:
I’ve been tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants since 2020, helped detect new variants circulating in a state, worked on SPHERES, and helped to established a Pathogen Genomics Center of Excellence. Despite loving my work and believing in its importance, I’m struggling with trauma from watching public health and science being systematically undermined. The CDC has become unreliable, the public rejects the tools we use to protect them, and I feel hopeless watching the fields I’ve dedicated my life to being gutted while being powerless to stop it.

I am scared for myself and people around me, and I don’t know if there are any steps I can take to stay safe. Like I can’t make my own vaccine lol. I’m worried about my mom- she was terribly sick from COVID in 2022 and works with kids, but im scared she won’t even qualify for COVID vaccines in the future with access becoming stricter.

I’ve always felt like the black sheep in my family, not because of who I am, but because of what I value. I started working for a medical school 3 years ago and I teach family centered care, health policy, how to advocate, and sexuality topics all within in the lens of disability. This drove me to pursue my MPH. I love my work. I love my degree. I just had my first guest lecture at an Ivy League for a workshop I’m developing all before I even graduate with my masters.  I have had some of the greatest highs of my career and I can’t  even celebrate them because my family can’t look past their discomfort. No one ever asks me about how work is or what I’m learning, or what’s going on in my life outside my relationship or how I look. My degree is “controversial” and my work is “political”.
Yet still I sit there quietly, waiting for my turn, waiting for someone to show curiosity about me… but it never comes. As the youngest, I’ve spent years thinking eventually they’d see me, that my moment would come. But I’m realizing maybe it never will. We live in a different world now. 
I don’t want applause or praise. I just want to be considered, to be asked, to feel like I belong in my own family. And it stings to realize that in their eyes, my existence feels less comfortable to engage with than others’ all because after covid I chose to run towards the chaos not from it…

Vaccinate Me (Parody of “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepson)

My symptoms went clinical
Blood cells in several vials
Worried about survival
But now I’m a-okay

It’s in a swabbed petri dish
Measles and mumps in a twist
Immunocompromised-ish
But now it’s in my face (AAAAH!)

Fido’s salivating
Bit knees, hydrophobing
Mad eyes, spit is foaming
Where to vaccinate for rabies?

Hey, metric units
Our techs so savvy 
Wear gloves of rubber
And vaccinate me!

All natural might
succeed, maybe. 
Goggles for cover
Oh, doctors, save me.

Health? It just sounds good
Those attackers faze me
Bacterial bummers
Thank anti-bodies!

And all the viral loads
Keep on shedding
But here's my blood count
So call me, later…

I put my pneumococcal
On calendar schedule
Plus a Meningococcal
Grad school, I’m on my way

Shun Polio and Shingles
After Bill Gate’s great deal
I wasn’t sure they’d repeal that
Blueprint on our tray

Your sanitation
Rotavirus sowing
Cholera is growing
Won’t you try Vaxchora, baby?

Hey, a mosquito
So don’t be lazy
For yellow fever
YF-Vax, maybe?

So therapeutic
All pharmacies
But I’ll take Pfizer
So jab me, band me. 

Hib, inflamed tissue
Pneumonia frenzy
Meningitis numbs me- 
Get droplets off me!

Yet swollen lymph nodes,
Rashes, bleeding 
And miscarriage are
Rubella freebies

Before you gave us longer lives
Covid was so sad
TB was so bad
We need you so, so bad

Before your butterfly shaped-knifes
Plague masks were so rad
Remember those rats
We tip-toed so, so bad

The future looked bright
Through R&D
but if your funding
Is drying, lately

Cause, we forget flus
As distant memories
In aging members
Of human families

Belief in Corduroy
Might not change things
But here what matters–
So lawyers, capeesh?--

Eradicated smallpox’s strife
Nations were so glad
Nations were so glad
Nations were so, so glad

Because you came into my life
I hug my sick dad
And you should know that

So vaccinate me!

As it is, the draft plan ignores important scientific facts and significantly downplays the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

Here are some suggested talking points that you can use for comment. As usual, try to put things into your own words and expand wherever you’d like. You can call on the WHO to: 

* Recognize airborne transmission as the primary mode of COVID-19 spread and the primary mode of the spread of all respiratory pathogens. 

* Make clean indoor air a core component of infection prevention

* Center Long COVID prevention, treatment, and research

* Acknowledge COVID-19 as a vascular, multi-system disease with long-term impacts from viral persistence 

* Define COVID-19 as a respiratory-transmitted disease (RTD), not a respiratory disease

* Ensure public access to effective respiratory protection (eg. N95 respirators or better)

* Ensure public access to effective vaccines for COVID-19",1mkkpzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/1mkkpzp/call_to_action_the_world_health_organization_is/,4

I’m seeking stories and perspectives — from individuals, families, healthcare workers, voters, and anyone with a personal or political connection to these programs.

I’m especially interested in:
* How proposed cuts to Medicaid/SNAP may affect you or your loved ones
* The role these programs have played in your life — directly or indirectly
* Historical or generational reflections (e.g., how they helped a parent or grandparent)
* Political perspectives in 2024 and supported him — but feel conflicted or surprised by this bill. What changed?)
There’s no right or wrong answer — I’m just hoping to gather a diverse range of stories and opinions to better understand how this legislation is landing in real life.

publichealth,AccidentalQuaker,1752738069.0,Is the CPH/MCHES...really advancing public health,"This might be a flamethrower but someone raised good points in another post. 

A few disclaimers: 1. I have a CPH (about to expire) and probably will renew it before it expires this fall....Only way Doctors in my org recognize my skillset. 2. I did volunteer to write questions for the next question bank...I backed out when I saw how out of touch the process was. 

I see the logic in having accreditation for our field...which has always had a marketing problem. And now we have Measles McGee as the loudest voice in Public Health. 

But...here's the thing. Long before MPHs existed....people did health education and public health. And people do public health...while MPHs remain inaccessible. I have the highest education on my work team but...interms of effectiveness and cultural competency...health equity falls flat. Especially when we try to credential health education as an academic or clinical commodity. 

Why can't the health educators/promotoras/community health workers get an MCHES after 20 years of experience? Hell, I cannot get an MCHES because cost and my course work did not have enough courses for their high standards. But while our org faces Medicaid/Medicare cuts....having that MCHES would help health educators access critical certifications needed for insurance reimbursement. 

The CPH which is a generalist certification...has more egregious issues. My boss has 20 years of public health experience and just got her Bachelors. She is passed over for promotions because of her perceived lack of experience (ie Master Degree...which she is working on). I was hoping with the 10 years of experience rule...we could get a more diverse workforce and volunteered to write questions for the bank...God forbid there is some plain language and accessible questions. 

I was the only non-professor in the room and the CPH criteria were so out of touch with boots on the ground public health work. People have curbed pandemics without epi stats. Yes Epis have a critical role, but as COVID taught us...it requires interdisciplinary skills for effective contact tracing. Or all the policy details that...are proving irrelevant in 2025

At a time where the public is losing faith in public health...CPH and MCHES are backfiring with fostering relationships and building a more equitable workplace. But my skills are equitably valuable to my coworkers' life experience. 

Maybe I am cynical and have the wrong attitude (please feel free to call me out), but we could be using these tools to repair public health...not make it an exclusive club.

Honestly, the only reason I still have my job past October 1 is that  the other Health Educator is moving to Florida this week.  
We've had to cancel a parent education event for youth alcohol & substance use prevention. We're searching for alternative sources of funding to continue our safe sex kit distribution, our hygiene kit distribution, and our HCV testing kits. We keep getting notices about administrative delays on our harm reduction grant continuation, which threatens our harm reduction program, SSP, anti stigma training, and Narcan community access point efforts. We just got our syringe services program and wellness vending machine off the ground in 2024, it would be a damn shame to lose it. The delay notices are not encouraging, considering what's already happened. But we didn't even get delay notices with those, so who knows if that means anything. Additionally, I know the Federal Senior Falls coalition is not being funded in the proposed budget, so I'm not confident the Senior Falls Prevention Funding will see renewal should it pass. The Senior Center may lose it's Bingocize and Matter of Balance classes through us; which is the only physical activity many of this aging County's Seniors get.

We have lost Creating Healthy Communities funding, and with that the Healthy Eating and Active Living projects. Everything our Community Health Division provides is entirely grant-funded through Federal dollars passed through via the State Dept of Health, but the public doesn't know that.  
I don't think rural America realized in the world of public health grant funding, ""rural community"" is very much a DEI concept. We got a competitive advantage in securing all this funding for programming through the State \*because\* our people have low incomes, high blood sugar, high SVIs, and poor Provider:Patient ratios---Health DEI

I built a small app to help me stay updated on research topics I care about, without getting lost in social media or news feeds. You just type in what you want to follow (like health policies, vaccines, etc.), and it sends you updates from good sources every few hours.

I made this because I used to rely on Twitter, LinkedIn, and news sites, but I’d always end up scrolling through stuff I didn’t care about. This app just gives me what I asked for and nothing else.

Right now it pulls from sources like The Health Care Blog, HealthPopuli, 2 Minute Medicine, Medical Xpress, medRxiv, and BMJ. It includes a few broader sites too like Nature, IEEE, The Conversation, The Verge, and TechCrunch.

Still very early. I’d love to get a few people to try it out and tell me what’s working or not. You can check it out here: [www.a01ai.com](http://www.a01ai.com).

publichealth,HurryInteresting8339,1750308610.0,I am writing a proposal intended to protect the brains of adolescent THC consumers from THC exposure-induced abnormalities during cognitive development using a low-risk low-cost nutraceutical intervention,"This is an email I plan on sending to a nutrition program coordinator in my local municipality. My school board currently bans all teas from being made available in high schools due to a hasty blanket ban on caffeinated products. I feel very strongly that my proposal is well-justified but I have no formal post-secondary education and so I'm concerned about being self-conceited in that assessment and I hope someone with a relevant background can speak to the validity of the assumptions I've derived from a recent study (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7842745/pdf/zns739.pdf) that seems to me to imply intense neuroprotective features in the face of chronic THC exposure during brain development.

Hello [redacted]

I am writing as a concerned citizen to ask that you help make available green and black teas high in concentrations of an amino acid called l-theanine to high school students as part of the nutrition program you administer. I ask this mainly for the sake of accomplishing the mitigation and prevention of THC-related brain damage occurring during adolescence among a large number of our country's high school age constituents. Eight percent of youths aged 16-19 in Canada report daily or near-daily consumption of THC products(Key findings on non-medical use of cannabis in Canada in 2024). A huge amount of the students in our highschool education system therefore are chronically THC-exposed frequently enough to cause tragic and irreversible abnormalities in brain development to occur which persist into adulthood and predictably hinder these students cognitive capabilities over the course of their academic careers and lifetimes beyond(Adverse Effects of Cannabis on Adolescent Brain Development: A Longitudinal Study, Jazmin Camchong et al., 2016). THC exposure untreated will predictably exacerbate  academic underachievement among affected students and will heighten their likelihood of participating in dangerous and unproductive behavioral patterns, at both their personal individual and our collective societal expense.

Here is the significance statement presented by a group of researchers at the university of Western Ontario who were recently capable of confirming the intense neuroprotective implications of l-theanine at it relates to mitigating the harms associated with THC exposure during adolescence:

""SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT With the increasing trend of cannabis legalization and consumption during adolescence, it is essential to expand knowledge on the potential effects of adolescent cannabis exposure on brain development and identify potential pharmacological strategies to minimize Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced neuropathology. Previous evidence demonstrates that adolescent THC exposure induces long-lasting affective and cognitive abnormalities, mesocorticolimbic dysregulation, and schizophrenia-like molecular biomarkers that persist into adulthood. We demonstrate for the first time that l-theanine, an amino acid analog of l-glutamate and l-glutamine, is capable of preventing long-term THC side effects. l-Theanine prevented the development of THC-induced behavioral aberrations, blocked cortical downregulation of local GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) and Akt signaling pathways, and normalized dysregulation of both [prefrontal cortex] and [Ventral Tegmental Area] DAergic activity, demonstrating powerful and functional neuroprotective effects against THC-induced developmental neuropathology.""

Taken from: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7842745/pdf/zns739.pdf

Here is another excerpt from that same study:

""In conclusion, we report a novel neuroprotective role for l-theanine in mitigating the neuropsychiatric side effects of chronic adolescent THC exposure. The range of neuroprotective effects induced by l-theanine were remarkable not only for their persistence beyond the adolescent THC exposure period, but for the comprehensive nature of its protective effects. These benefits extended beyond the prevention of THC-induced affective and cognitive disturbances and included the prevention of long-term molecular and neuronal adaptations within the [prefrontal cortex] and a concomitant normalization of subcortical DAergic abnormalities.""

By providing access to teas high in concentrations of l-theanine to highschool students you can help prevent the maladaptive THC consumption habits of highschool students from causing irreparable and societally expensive harm to their long-term cognitive functioning as it relates to their capacity for memory recollection, anxiety management, attention span and motivation.  L-theanine co administration alongside THC exposure protects the prefrontal cortex as well as the mesocorticolimbic circuitry from THC exposure-induced abnormalities during cognitive development (Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021) . L-theanine coadministration alongside THC was found in the study I cite to restore the short-term memory deficits observed in adolescent THC-exposed rats (Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021). L-theanine coadministration alongside THC exposure is found in the same animal study to prevent the development of anhedonic and anxiety-like symptoms considered to be endophenotypes of both chronic THC exposure and schizophrenia(Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021). As THC exposure occurs chronically during adolescence the brain becomes more akin to a schizophrenic brain but as co-exposure to l-theanine occurs cognitive development is found to be normalized into adulthood despite chronic adolescent THC exposure(Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021). These researchers have uncovered concrete biomechanical justifications for observed behavioral improvements which we have every reason to expect will scale if we facilitate widespread access to green and black teas for the highschool students under the purview of the [redacted] School Board via something like the student nutrition program you administer.

There are government revenue generating implications associated with improving the academic performances of chronically THC-exposed highschool students since an anticipated increase in the lifetime economic output and annual income of these individuals would cause higher total tax revenues collected by Canadian governments. Because there are blatant relationships between a person's capacity for memory recollection and focus and their academic performance and because l-theanine co-exposure during THC exposure is found to protect areas of the brain relevant to these fundamental capabilities such as the prefrontal cortex, the ventral tegmental area and the mesocorticolimbic system from the predictable harms of chronic THC exposure(Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021), we can reasonably anticipate an improvement in academic performance among chronically THC-exposed highschool students to result from the proposed low-cost and low-risk nutraceutical intervention of subsidizing the presence of green and black teas in highschools.

Chronic exposure to THC during adolescence causes the emergence of biomarkers in the brain which are consistent with those observed in the brains of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia(Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021). Schizophrenia is recognized to anticipate a higher likelihood of perpetrating acts of violence relative to the general population (Trends in violent offending among people with schizophrenia: A 10-year ecological study, Huijuan Guo et al., 2024). This implies that as highschool-aged Canadians chronically expose themselves to THC they are predicting themselves into being more violent than if they hadn't experienced chronic THC exposure during adolescence. Because there is a relationship between the incidence of violent behaviour in society and the cost of the criminal justice system a reduction in the incidence of violence in society due to enabling access to sources of l-theanine among chronically THC-exposed adolescents would achieve a cost-savings for Canadian governments and that cost savings serves as justification for the cost burden imposed on the city's budget if the decision is made to allocate funding for the provision of access to green and black teas for highschool students in the [redacted #]highschools the [redacted] SchoolBoard oversees.

Reductions in the incidence of in-class disruptions can help to accelerate the pace of learning of all students, not only those suffering from chronic THC exposure. Improved in-class behavior caused by the treatment of chronic THC exposure-induced cognitive abnormalities via ingestion of l-theanine can be expected to contribute to reduced incidence of burnout and greater talent retention among highschool educators since the onset of the decision to retire among highschool teachers is related to the observed quality of in-class behavior among highschool students which will predictably improve as some chronically THC-exposed students are treated by the ingestion of the sources of l-theanine made available to students.

When our nutraceutical intervention produces improved in-class behaviour on the part of chronically THC-exposed students we will witness improved retention of experienced educators in the face of opportunities for retirement, increasing our effective talent pool and improving the proportionality of highschool educators to highschool students. Because teaching is a skill there is a cultivation of mastery involved that exists majorly as a function of time such that we can anticipate a higher degree of mastery over the skill of teaching among retirement-age teachers relative to their younger counterparts. Thusly improving the retention of retirement-age teachers by making their jobs less miserable through a nutraceutical intervention with desirable implications for student behavior can potentially cause the average quality of teacher our highschool students receive in our education system to become improved over time as their teachers remain more experienced on average relative to the alternative scenario of no intervening mitigation of brain damage and so a higher incidence of retirement-age teacher burnout as THC-induced neuropathologies among the chronically THC-exposed cohort of highschool students play out in the form of disruptive behaviors and psychologically grating attention-deficit-style behaviors.

Multiple studies have affirmed a causal relationship between ingestion of l-theanine and an improved sleep quality (The effects of L-theanine consumption on sleep outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Amanda Bulman et al, june 2025)and psychometric performance (Effects of L-Theanine Administration on Stress-Related Symptoms and Cognitive Functions in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial, Shinsuke Hidese et al. 2019). Because there is an observed relationship between a students sleep quality and their academic performance it can be anticipated that providing access to l-theanine via green and black tea to highschool students will cause among non-THC-exposed students improvements to their academic performance by vehicle of improved sleep quality. I personally consume decaffeinated green tea, and would recommend that decaffeinated green tea be made readily available. Because there is an observed relationship between psychometric evaluation performance and academic performance, the improvements to psychometric evaluation performance caused by ingestion of l-theanine can be expected to improve academic performance among non-THC-exposed students. The long-term tax revenue increases associated with having a more academically achieved and cognitively healthy workforce can realistically outweigh the cost burden of subsidizing the presence of green and black teas in highschools.

The incidence of need for caretakers in old age among individuals with schizophrenia is elevated relative to the general population. As Canadian youths chronically expose themselves to THC their brains manifest in adulthood some of schizophrenia's signature biomarkers and similar behaviors are exhibited(Marta De Felice et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, January 27, 2021). The strong implication is that we can expect an elevated incidence of need for caretakers among adolescents chronically exposed to THC later on in life. The associated impact on our society's healthcare needs can be expected to create expensive scarcity problems elsewhere in the economy as a relatively larger amount of our limited labour supply must be sacrificed towards caretaking cognitively unhealthy individuals. Keeping people self-reliant and cognitively fit into old age is an especially prescient concern in the context of Healthcare now being a higher proportion of GDP than at any point in history outside of the two-year period after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the context of our country's worsening dependency ratio (https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Canada/Age_dependency_ratio/) .

I believe that making the study itself accessible to students or faithfully explaining why coadministration of l-theanine alongside THC exposure is neuroprotective would foster a deeper understanding of the predictable harms of drug use during the cognitive development period of one's life and would encourage good drug use hygiene in our highschool student populations broadly which could affect the incidence of self-victimization of youths via more acutely dangerous substances as this demographic of student's relationship to substance use in general becomes more cautious. This nutraceutical intervention can help to cultivate a general habit of prevention of harm among the student body which has diffuse harm reduction implications out of frame of the present subject.

“Consistent with previous reports (Renard et al., 2017a), we observed significant social memory deficits following adolescent THC exposure. Similar to object recognition deficits, these social cognition impairments were completely reversed by L-theanine administration.”

“Consistent with clinical and preclinical findings (Rubino et al., 2008; Bambico et al., 2010; Renard et al., 2017a), we observed long-term anhedonia and increased anxiety-like behaviors following adolescent THC exposure. Remarkably, L-theanine blocked both anhedonic and anxiety-related phenotypes induced by adolescent THC”

“In line with previous reports (Renard et al., 2017a,b), adolescent THC exposure induced a range of long-term behavioral symptoms resembling neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including deficits in social recognition and short-term memory, anhedonia, sensorimotor gating impairments, and increased anxiety. Remarkably, L-theanine significantly normalized all these THC-related neurodevelopmental behavioral phenotypes into adulthood.”

“While the present study used long-term neurodevelopmental protocols for THC and L-theanine exposure, our finding that L-theanine prevented the effects of chronic CB1R stimulation (via adolescent THC exposure) on inducing PFC-related and VTA-related neuronal pathologies may suggest a mechanism by which L-theanine may block longer-term dysregulation of anxiety-related and mood-related phenotypes via normalization of PFC/VTA-related neuronal dysregulation.”

“As previously reported (Renard et al., 2017a), adolescent THC exposure significantly impairs sensorimotor gating in adulthood. We found that L-theanine fully prevented this THCinduced sensory-gating deficit. While the precise mechanisms underlying THC-induced PPI deficits are not currently understood, normal gamma-oscillation activity in the sensory cortex is necessary for effective sensorimotor gating (Cheng et al., 2016). Given that L-theanine was able to prevent the development of PFC-related gamma-oscillation disturbances, this effect may relate to the preventative effects of theanine on THC-induced cognitive filtering impairments”

“We observed profound reductions in phosphorylated levels of PFC GSK-3a/b and Akt-Thr308 levels following adolescent THC exposure, concomitant with dysregulated PFC neuronal activity states. While future studies are required to examine the causal mechanisms associated with these molecular adaptations, the ability of L-theanine to prevent these THC-induced molecular and neuronal phenotypes may underlie the normalization of long-term sensorimotor gating impairments. Interestingly, a previous report demonstrated that a single administration of L-theanine was able to ameliorate PPI impairments induced by MK-801 (Wakabayashi et al., 2012), suggesting that the potential benefits of L-theanine on THC-induced cognitive impairments may extend beyond cannabinoid-related signaling mechanisms”

“Cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia have been correlated with abnormal cortical oscillation patterns, which are crucial for the normal coordination of excitatory versus inhibitory neural elements within many neural circuits, including the mesocorticolimbic system (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010). Clinical and preclinical studies have described dysregulation of cortical gamma-band frequencies linked to schizophrenia-related cognitive abnormalities (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010; Williams and Boksa, 2010; Raver et al., 2013). In the present study, we observed a persistent dysregulation in gamma band (frequency powers between 30 and 80 Hz) in desynchronized states, in the PFC of adolescent THC-exposed rats. Interestingly, L-theanine administration was able to prevent these THCinduced oscillatory disturbances. While we are not aware of any previous studies examining the role of L-theanine in cortical gamma-oscillatory regulation, the effects of L-theanine may relate to the normalization of THC-induced pyramidal neuron bursting disturbances and concomitant normalization of GABAergic/ glutamatergic signaling disturbances following adolescent THC exposure.”

# Who are we?

We’re [Discourse Labs](http://discourselabs.org), a nonprofit organization interested in building tools and resources for productive public dialogue. You can find out more about us at our[ website](https://www.discourselabs.org/).

# Why we made this map

When we looked at conversations about vaccines online, we found that the same topics and questions repeat, and the evidence gets buried. 

It’s also easy to just *know* vaccines are safe and effective, without knowing how to retrace your steps and find scientific evidence for that knowledge in a way that’s easy to share with others.

So, we made a clickable, expandable mind map — a visual resource that organizes common arguments, questions, and concerns about vaccines – along with links to reputable sources, studies, and other resources, to make it easier for people to:

* Explore the full range of vaccine-related topics,
* Understand and have personal clarity on where certain arguments come from,
* Access reliable information quickly, and
* Have more productive conversations — online, *or* in person!.

We tried to keep it balanced but evidence-based, drawing from peer-reviewed research, public health institutions, and experts. It’s not meant to overwhelm with data, but to be a starting point for deeper learning or sharing with others.

# How you can help

We’d love to hear your feedback:

* Is anything missing or unclear?
* Are there other sources we should include?
* How can we make it more useful to you?

We’re also happy to answer questions about how it’s structured or how to use it. Thanks for taking a look!

I've never had the flu before and been this short of breath!! I took two rapid tests that were both negative but I know how ineffective rapid tests are and even living in one of the most liberal cities in America I know from trying to find them during a previous illness that there are no PCR tests readily accessible anywhere in our city. I knew I needed Paxlovid and I also knew there was no way to get a test to prove I needed it, so I had to go to telehealth and send them a photo from the Internet of a random positive test to get treatment. Everyone acted like I was overreacting and then 5 days after my symptoms started, my roommate and best friend got sick with the exact same symptoms I had in the exact same order, and my roommate lost her sense of taste. She definitely got it from me and it is definitely COVID - I was not crazy!! I'm so glad I got the Paxlovid because my best friend literally got Type 1 diabetes from COVID last year. The virus attacked their pancreas and they cannot produce insulin anymore. They're in a clinical study about it and they are definitely not the only case popping up like this. There is still a pandemic and it's a mass disabling event and there's a medication available that's 89% effective against preventing hospitalization but there are so many barriers to getting it and nobody is being recommended masking! Every article I read is like ""new variant just dropped but doctors say don't panic!"" I've had COVID 3x, I'm young and healthy, and I've never felt this sick - it's really going for my lungs! I'm so fed up with the government pretending nothing is happening and actively covering this up and letting us die. And side note - I'm so glad I have the kind of friends that communicate about our COVID risks and take care of each other when we're sick and put a box of Paxlovid in front of each other and say ""this is gonna taste gross but you need to take it."" Take care of your communities y'all. Mask up and stay safe out there and sending you love 😷♥️♥️♥️",1l026s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/1l026s0/covid_rant/,213

• *Overall, 41 percent of the 278 toddlers whose parents reported them having had COVID-19 had at least one prolonged symptom. The proportion was similar in the preschool group, with 45 percent of the 399 children having a lasting symptom.*

• *The younger children were more likely to experience difficulty sleeping, increased fussiness, poor appetite, a stuffy nose, and a cough. The older kids, on the other hand, most often displayed a dry cough and daytime sleepiness or low energy.*

• *…three of the study’s authors write that almost 6 million US children could be affected by long COVID, which is greater than the number of kids with asthma.*

• *Based on the results of their research and previous data, they show how children and young people with long COVID can be split into four broad groups, with slightly different symptom profiles that parents and caregivers can look out for: 0-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years.*",1kxmkld,https://www.iflscience.com/first-of-its-kind-study-reveals-how-long-covid-looks-different-in-young-children-79363,142

It would be great seeing an updated study using a larger sample size, accounting for number of COVID infections each participant had, and including vaccinated individuals as well.

Given other research on COVID and immune dysfunction, however, I am ultimately not surprised by what I read here.

China tends to be cryptic in their public descriptions of avian flu cases, usually only providing an onset date, the patients age and gender, and the province where it occurred.

Additional details on the patient's outcome, or exposures, are often only later revealed in the WHO's WHO: Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface Summary and Assessment. Typically, H9N2 presents as a mild infection, and is most often reported in children, although we've seen an increase in older adult infections in recent months.

>For reasons that aren't clear, female cases have outnumber males by a considerable margin (cite).

Despite decades of mandated use of vaccines, H9N2 remains poorly controlled in Chinese poultry (see J. Virus Erad.: Ineffective Control Of LPAI H9N2 By Inactivated Poultry Vaccines - China), which has led to the creation and spread of numerous genotypes.

>While H9N2 remains far from our biggest pandemic threat, the CDC has designated 2 different lineages (A(H9N2) G1 and A(H9N2) Y280) as having some pandemic potential (see CDC IRAT SCORE), and several candidate vaccines have been developed.

Which is why we monitor these reports with considerable interest.  ",1o6goa1,https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/10/hk-chp-reports-2-recent-h9n2-cases-from.html,33
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760386083.0,Firings of hundreds of CDC employees reportedly reversed,"The firings of hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have been reversed, according to several reports citing officials familiar with the matter, and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers.

On Friday, the White House budget office announced that as a result of the ongoing government shutdown, reductions in force (RIFs) across agencies have begun.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which houses the CDC, initially said that all employees that received layoff notices “were designated non-essential by their respective divisions”.

However, over the weekend, the administration rescinded more than half of the 1,300 termination notices it sent to public health officials at the CDC, according to Axios and Reuters, citing sources familiar. Around 600 people at the agency remain fired.

On Saturday, the New York Times reported that members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), informally known as “disease detectives”, as well as the team that compiles the widely respected scientific journal, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, were among the employees reinstated.

Initially, around 70 members of EIS were laid off, according to the Times report. Also affected were Athalia Christie and Maureen Bartee, who are leading the federal response to the measles outbreak. The Times reported that the two infectious disease experts were laid off, only to receive an email saying that their firings “on or about” 10 October had been rescinded a day later.

A senior administration official told the Times that the mistakenly fired workers “were sent incorrect notifications”, adding that “any correction has already been remedied”.

A federal health official also told ABC News that the mistake was due to a “coding error”. Neither the White House nor HHS have immediately responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment about how many employees have been recalled to their roles.

“These firings are an assault on the health and lives of every person in the US,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist and member of Defend Public Health, a volunteer network of experts who work to challenge the Trump administration’s public health policies.

“Did they not care enough to find out who they were firing and what they did before sending termination letters? The carelessness and callousness with which this administration handles life and death matters is unbelievable.”

The AFGE has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the firings across agencies. In a court filing, the government said that the layoffs across the federal workforce will impact over 4,000 employees. Later this week, a federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments in the case.

The CDC has endured significant tumult in recent months. In August, a gunman targeted the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta, firing hundreds of bullets and killing a police officer in the attack. The perpetrator had blamed the Covid vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal. [...] ",1o5uoel,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/firings-cdc-employees-reversed,147
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760390309.0,"Quick takes: Whooping cough in Florida, mpox in Spain, Maldives achieves public health first","Cases of pertussis (whooping cough) in Florida have risen by 81% this year, according to reporting by USA Today. As of September 27, 1,295 pertussis cases had been reported to the Florida Department of Health, compared with 715 in all of 2024, and 63% of the 2025 cases are in children aged 0 to 9.

 Pediatricians in the state say the increase could represent a combination of waning immunity, gaps in vaccine coverage, and increasing community spread. The increase in pertussis cases is occurring amid a push by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo to repeal the state's vaccine requirements. Florida currently requires public school children to have at least four doses of the TDaP (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine.

Health officials in Madrid, Spain, say they have identified the first locally acquired case of clade 1b mpox, the more virulent form of the virus, according to Spanish news site La Vanguardia. The patient is a 49-year-old man who is in home isolation. Clade 1b was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in August 2024 because of its rapid spread and greater severity compared with the clade 2 virus, which circulated the globe in 2022. Although clade 1b is primarily causing outbreaks in Central Africa, at least 15 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America have confirmed clade 1b infections.

The WHO said today that the Maldives has become the first country in the world to achieve ""triple elimination"" of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis. After achieving elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis in 2019, the South Asian archipelago was just validated for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The WHO said the achievement was the result of building an integrated and comprehensive approach to maternal and child health.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760145525.0,Hundreds of U.S. students quarantined amid measles outbreaks,"A bubbling measles outbreak in the upstate of South Carolina has forced 153 unvaccinated children out of the classroom and into quarantine for a minimum of 21 days.

In Minnesota, where a small outbreak has been growing for the last month, 118 students are also under quarantine in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area after being exposed to the highly contagious virus, health officials said Friday.

The restrictions mean three weeks of remote learning as parents monitor for fever, rash and other symptoms.

“Communities are having to bear the price of quarantining so many children,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Expect more of the same. This is going to happen more and more frequently.”

**Active, ongoing transmissions**

On Thursday, the South Carolina Department of Public Health said that a measles case had been diagnosed in Greenville County, without any known link to seven other cases in neighboring Spartanburg County.

“What this new case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said during a press briefing Thursday.

The South Carolina cases have been identified in two schools (one elementary school and one charter school with students from kindergarten through 12th grade).

Unvaccinated children who were exposed to the virus will be “excluded” from school for three weeks, the length of time it could take for a measles exposure to cause symptoms, Bell said.

“Those measures will help us be effective in preventing the spread of measles virus in those schools and in our communities,” she said.

According to NBC News data, the K-12 vaccination rate for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak. In neighboring Greenville County, the MMR vaccination rate was 90.5%. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760124101.0,"As the Flu Surges in Asia, Could Getting Sick Year-Round Be the New Normal?","A surge of influenza cases in countries across Asia has led some medical experts to warn that getting sick more easily throughout the year may be the new reality.

Health authorities in Japan declared a nationwide flu epidemic on Oct. 3 after a wave of flu cases came five weeks earlier than expected for flu season, the country’s second-earliest flu outbreak in 20 years.

 More than 4,000 people in Japan were treated for influenza between Sept. 22 and Sept. 28. The country’s Ministry of Health said that equated to an average of 1.04 patients per monitored medical institution, surpassing the threshold for an epidemic. The number of patients treated for influenza has since increased to over 6,000 people from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, corresponding to a per-institution patient count of 1.56, more than double the per-institution patient count of 0.77 for the same period last year. Across the country, from Sept. 22 to Oct. 3, 135 schools and childcare centers closed, three times more than during the same period last year.

 Twenty-eight of Japan’s 47 prefectures reported an increase in flu cases, with Okinawa reporting the highest patient per-institution count.

But it’s not just Japan. Flu cases have risen in recent weeks in other countries across the continent, including Singapore, Thailand, and India. The latter, in particular, has been gripped by the spread of the H3N2 virus in the country’s north. The seasonal H3N2 descends from the strain that caused the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic, which had combined human and avian influenza viruses, Dr. Martin Beer, vice president of Germany’s Federal Institute for Animal Health, the Friedrich Loeffler Institut, told DW News. [...] 

The rise in flu cases around the continent, as well as outbreaks in Europe earlier this year, have led some medical experts to warn that influenza may be evolving to spread more quickly or earlier than typical in some regions.

“The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario,” Yoko Tsukamoto, a professor at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, told the South China Morning Post about the epidemic in Japan.

Nicola Lewis, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London, warned last year that the next global pandemic could be caused by the flu. “I think the chances that disease X will be an influenza virus are probably greater than for any other known pathogen group that I can think of,” Lewis said. Disease X refers to a hypothetical new or unknown disease that can cause a pandemic.

In Singapore, there has been a slight uptick in the number of cases with acute respiratory infections in the last two weeks, according to data from the country’s Ministry of Health, which monitors disease trends through sentinel surveillance sites including polyclinics and General Practitioner (GP) clinics. Predominantly, those cases have been the common cold rhinoviruses and influenza.

There was also a spike in flu cases last month. Dr. Zhang Qi told Channel News Asia in September that he saw a “sustained and clear surge” of patients visiting his clinic for the flu. DoctorAnywhere, a network with both physical clinics and telehealth, also noted an increase of up to 40% in flu cases.

Influenza cases are typically higher between December and March and between May and August, according to Singapore’s Communicable Diseases Agency. But the agency told CNA there’s no evidence that infections have been more severe than usual.

Dr. Kimberly Fornace, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s school of public health, tells TIME that there are “clear seasonal patterns described for influenza in non-tropical areas,” with a higher incidence of flu cases typically reported in colder temperatures. At least part of that comes down to human behavior: “Influenza may transmit more easily when people are spending most of their time indoors during winter,” Fornace says.

When it comes to tropical areas, though, she says there is “less understanding of these patterns.” But, anecdotally, there could be a similar pattern when it comes to wet weather. Some doctors say when the rainfall season hits in tropical countries like Singapore, people may similarly crowd indoors. Singapore has seen frequent late morning and afternoon thunderstorms in recent weeks as inter-monsoon conditions set in.

Thailand’s Public Health Ministry also warned of a surge in influenza cases in September. Between Sept. 7 and 13, data from the country’s Department of Disease Control showed more than 30,000 new influenza cases, bringing the country’s total this year to more than 555,000 with 59 deaths. That increase came as Thailand also saw heavy rainfall amid its monsoon season, as well as extreme weather that has been exacerbated by climate change.

There has been limited research into possible links between climate change and infectious diseases. A 2024 study from researchers based in Singapore suggested that climate change, including heatwaves, higher rainfall, and tropical cyclones, can increase the transmission of some viral diseases, particularly vector-borne and food or water-borne diseases, as well as increase the growth and resistance of some bacteria. The study did not look specifically at influenza.

Meanwhile, molecular biologist and science journalist Kai Kupferschmidt suggested in Science Magazine that influenza epidemics may become less severe as the planet warms, but outbreaks may become more common, rather than season-dependent. “As epidemics become less severe in a warming climate, the virus is more likely to circulate yearround in many places,” Kupferschmidt wrote.

Fornace, whose research focuses on the impact of environmental change on infectious disease dynamics, tells TIME that “the evidence is still mixed.”

“There is definitely an effect of climatic conditions on spillover events from wildlife (for example, changes in wild bird migration patterns due to climate change),” Fornace says. “There are also some potential effects on the pathogen biology, such as survival and transmission rates under different environmental conditions.”

But the clearest effects may be seen in how people alter their behaviors in relation to the changing climate.

“We know that people spend different amounts of time indoors and have different movement patterns with different weather conditions,” Fornace says. “We have also seen major impacts of climate change across the region on health systems, particularly in response to extreme weather events where it can be difficult to continue to deploy routine health measures,” such as vaccinations.

[...] 

Dr. Paul Tambyah, former president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, tells TIME that the emergence of new virus strains or variants is likely to be driving the increase in cases.

The World Health Organization’s vaccine recommendations for the 2026 Southern hemisphere flu season included two strains that are different from the 2025 Northern hemisphere flu season. The B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus was included in both, while the new recommendations are A/Missouri/11/2025 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus and A/Singapore/GP20238/2024 (H3N2)-like virus.

“This suggests that for both H1N1 and H3N2, there are drifted (or mutated) influenza strains circulating, which we may not be immune to if we got the previous flu vaccine or were infected in the last flu wave,” Tambyah says. “Hence the rise in flu cases in many parts of the world.”

In Japan, health officials have suggested that the flu epidemic could be caused by commingling factors, including the return of mass tourism after a drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“We are seeing a greater circulation of people, both in Japan and globally, with people taking the virus to new places, which is another factor behind the virus adapting to new environments,” Tsukamoto told SCMP.

It’s not clear that the viral strain impacting Japan, Singapore, and other countries is the same, although Tambyah says it’s likely. Still, he cautions that influenza viruses may not be evolving at a significantly more rapid pace than typical as some have suggested.

“The influenza virus has always had the ability to evolve rapidly to avoid immunity from either disease or vaccination,” Tambyah says. “Even the ‘normal’ pace of influenza virus evolution is hard to keep up with.”

But he adds, “there is no evidence that this is happening any faster or slower.”

Tambyah says scientists are closely watching the evolution of H5 and H7 or H9, subtypes of influenza A virus, in birds and animals.

“The big concern is if a totally new strain of influenza emerges other than H1, H3, or Flu B, to which we have very little immunity,” Tambyah says. “This would lead to a pandemic like the H2N2 Pandemic of 1957.” Also known as the “Asian Flu” pandemic because of where it originated, that pandemic nearly 70 years ago killed an estimated 1.1 million people worldwide, including some 116,000 in the U.S., according to the CDC.

[...] 

Ramanan Laxminarayan, an economist and epidemiologist who founded D.C.-based public health research organization One Health Trust, tells TIME that vaccination is particularly important for the elderly and other high risk populations. But he cautions, “this approach is dependent on our being able to predict the strains that will cause the following year’s outbreak and include these in the vaccine.”

“In the longer term, a universal flu vaccine that works across many flu strains and will only have to be taken once in a decade would be the long-term solution,” Laxminarayan adds, “but we are yet to get there.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760062320.0,Ontario declares measles outbreak over after nearly a year of spread,"
Ontario's measles outbreak, which sickened more than 2,300 people over the course of nearly a year, highlighted the consequences of declining vaccination rates and led to the death of a newborn, has been declared over.

Public Health Ontario and the province's top doctor said Thursday the outbreak ended on Monday because it had been 46 days since any new reported cases — twice the maximum incubation period for measles.

""In Ontario, the last confirmed case developed a rash on August 21, 2025, following several months of steadily declining case numbers,"" Dr. Kieran Moore, the province's chief medical officer of health, said in an emailed statement.

""We have now surpassed the required threshold with no additional cases identified.""

The spread, which infected 2,375 people in Ontario spanning 26 local public health units, started on Oct. 18 last year after exposure to someone who had measles in New Brunswick.

New Brunswick declared its outbreak over in January. 

Almost three-quarters of the people infected with measles in Ontario have been infants, children and adolescents. More than 96 per cent of them were unvaccinated.

During Ontario's outbreak, a baby in the province's southwest was infected with measles in the womb and died after the mother, who was unvaccinated, gave birth prematurely, the province announced in June.

Alberta, which has been in the midst of a measles outbreak since March, announced the death of a baby earlier this month. The infant was also born prematurely after the mother contracted measles while pregnant.

As of Thursday, 1,925 measles cases have been reported in Alberta.

Measles was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998, but the country may lose that status on Oct. 27.

 Elimination status is revoked after 12 months of continuous transmission.

There have been 43 additional cases of measles in Ontario this year that weren't linked to the outbreak, according a Public Health Ontario report released Thursday. Three of those people were infected in September.

The Public Health Agency of Canada's website shows that although the majority of measles cases in 2025 have been in Ontario and Alberta, infections have also been reported in every province.

One case was reported in the Northwest Territories. No cases have been reported in Yukon or Nunavut.

Moore cautioned that although the end of the outbreak ""marks an important milestone,"" measles is a ""serious and highly contagious disease"" and urged everyone to ensure their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations are up to date.

""Two doses of the MMR vaccine offer nearly 100 per cent protection and have been safely used for decades,"" he said.",1o2opux,https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/9.6933665,59
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760031726.0,"After a summer respite, bird flu is back","It was a quiet summer for bird flu: Egg prices fell a bit, fewer sick poultry flocks were culled on farms, and officials took a breath.

“It was lovely,” said Shauna Voss, the assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.

But it didn’t last.

Bird flu is spreading again, now that wild water fowl — geese, ducks and cranes — have begun their seasonal migrations. As the birds travel, they mingle at lakes and ponds and share viruses.

In poultry, bird flu cases are spiking earlier than expected. More than 4 million poultry birds have been culled in the last month, in states including Minnesota and Iowa, after members of their flock tested positive for the virus, called H5N1. The trend corresponds to a spike in infections detected among wild birds in northern states.

Some state officials are bracing for a challenging autumn, which is when cases have typically spiked in past years.

“Last week, we had our first confirmed positive,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said. The case was on a turkey farm in Calhoun County. “The question for us then is how extensive will it be and what kind of fall will we have.”

It’s too early to say what effect the outbreaks will have on egg prices, he added.

“The only honest answer to that is we will have to see. I wish I could give you more than that,” Naig said.

This is the fourth fall in which bird flu infections have risen, a sign the virus is becoming endemic in wild birds and could be a continual threat to poultry.

“It’s not going away. It seems pretty embedded,” Voss said.

The more the virus circulates, there is a risk that it will unlock a way to readily infect humans. If that becomes a problem, some experts fear that the Trump administration’s cuts to mRNA research could hamper scientists’ ability to rapidly develop a new vaccine. For now, though, the health risk to people remains low.

As fall progresses, officials, wildlife experts and virologists are in a watch-and-wait mode.

“It’s an interesting time,” said Declan Schroeder, an associate professor of virology at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what’s going to happen.” [...] 

**“Get your flu shot. Don’t drink raw milk, don’t eat unpasteurized cheese, particularly when cases are circulating. Don’t let your cats feed outside when it’s migratory bird season,”** Chin-Hong said.

A scenario in which a person gets infected with both H5N1 and seasonal flu at the same time could be problematic because it would enable the bird flu virus to more easily rearrange its genetic code to suit humans.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped holding coordination calls on H5N1 with health providers this spring — a change Chin-Hong laments. He hopes the agency will resume the calls, and he disagrees with the Trump administration’s termination of mRNA vaccine research funding. The biotech company Moderna was developing a bird flu vaccine that used the mRNA platform, but the Department of Health and Human Services canceled its grant.

The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1760032650.0,Mum's testing plea as Leicester has England's highest TB rate,"A mother who spent a year being treated for tuberculosis (TB) is calling on people to get tested following a rise in cases across England.

Jess Talbot-Jones lives in Birstall, just outside Leicester - the city with the UK's highest TB rate for the past two years.

The 38-year-old went through a lengthy course of medication alongside her husband and two-year-old son after contracting the disease and now wants people to understand the illness, its treatment and the stigma that surrounds it.

New statistics released by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed there were 5,490 active cases of the disease in England in 2024, compared to 4,831 in 2023, a rise of 13.6%.

Ms Talbot-Jones said her treatment for the disease, which can feature a mucus cough that lasts longer than three weeks, night sweats and weight loss, was ""traumatic"".

""I didn't really think that TB was a thing. I thought it was... more of a Victorian disease,"" she said.

""It was a bit of a shock really when I found out.

""But when reality hits and the stigma that you're the person that everybody around you has to get tested for because it is a bad disease - it is a bit of a scary thing.""

Ms Talbot-Jones said she suffered from the active form of the disease alongside her husband and son.

Her four other children had the latent form, which does not create symptoms and is not transmissible, according to the NHS.

However, it can turn into active TB in the future.

""It was really traumatic,"" she said. ""There's a lot of stigma around TB.

""It's seen as a disease that you can only catch if your immune system is low or if you're living in dirty conditions.

""That's not the case, you can catch it like a cough or a cold.

""If you have symptoms or fit the criteria, you should be tested.""

TB is preventable and curable, with 84.4% of patients completing treatment within 12 months, the UKHSA said.

However, if left untreated, the illness can cause irreversible damage to the lungs.

The body also said 82% of TB cases in 2024 were found in people born outside the UK, who often migrated to the country with the latent disease, which then became active.

In Leicester, there is a free test available for anyone, with or without symptoms, who has entered the UK within the past five years, has lived for at least six months in a country with high TB rates such as India or sub-Saharan Africa, and is aged between 16 and 35. [...] 

But in 2025 the bacterial infection still poses a significant threat to human health, with the World Health Organization reporting nearly 4,500 people lose their lives and 30,000 people fall ill with TB each day.

The bulk of cases of active TB detected in the UK are from people who were born in countries with a high incidence of the disease, such as India.

Undoubtedly, some of the increase in Leicester cases detected is due to more testing, which has increased since the Covid pandemic.

And since Brexit there has been a surge in people coming to work and study in Leicester from India, which has a high incidence of TB.

Public health experts in Leicester are trying to do more to detect active cases of the disease by raising awareness of the classic symptoms.

And the city is also home to extensive research into TB at a biomedical research centre at the Glenfield Hospital, run by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.

Dr Pranab Halder, clinical senior lecturer in respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester, said the city was ""bearing the brunt"" of a national rise in TB.

""TB is not a Victorian disease, it is a disease of our time,"" he said.

""It is not the disease that the stigma suggests - it can be cured and people will lead normal healthy lives if they get treated.""

In Leicester, the UKHSA has joined forces with NHS England and the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland integrated care board to tackle high rates of TB across the city.

The city has been confirmed to have the highest rate of cases in the UK for the second year in a row.

Cases in the local authority area increased from 42.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2024, compared with 40.7 the previous year, the UKHSA said. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759868751.0,"Locally transmitted US malaria cases highlight increased risk, CDC report suggests","A new paper describes the first locally acquired cases of mosquito-transmitted malaria in the United States in 20 years.

The paper, published yesterday in JAMA Network Open, examines the epidemiology of 10 locally transmitted malaria cases that were identified from May to September 2023 in Florida, Texas, Arkansas, and Maryland, and how public health officials responded to and contained the outbreaks. Authors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health departments in the four states say the cases were unexpected, though an increase in imported malaria cases and a hot summer in 2023 may have played a role.

Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, and the last locally transmitted cases prior to 2023 occurred in Florida in 2003. But the disease, which is caused by Plasmodium spp parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a significant health threat in Africa and many other parts of the world, with an estimated 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths in 2023. And despite US malaria elimination, Anopheles species persist in parts of the country.

The authors say that while a malaria is unlikely to reestablish itself in the United States, the cases highlight the need for vigilance.

""Increased travel and population movement to and from malaria-endemic regions, persistent vectors, and increased temperatures may be increasing the risk of local transmission in the US,"" they wrote.

**Of the 10 patients (median age, 39.5 years; 70% male) with confirmed malaria attributed to local transmission, 7 lived within a 4-mile radius of each other in Sarasota County, Florida, and experienced illness onset from May to July 2023. The three other patients were in Cameron County, Texas; National Capital Region, Maryland; and Saline County, Arkansas.** Nine of the patients were hospitalized, and one met the clinical criteria for severe malaria. All received antimalarial treatment and recovered.

None of the patients had traveled outside the country in the preceding 2 years or had a history of blood product transfusion, organ transplant, recent tattoos, or needle-sharing. But all reported time spent outdoors at night, when female Anopheles mosquitoes seek human hosts.

All seven Florida patients and the patients in Texas and Arkansas had Plasmodium vivax infections, and the patient in Maryland had a Plasmodium falciparum infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the Florida patients shared the same P vivax strain, while the Texas and Arkansas P vivax cases were genetically distinct from each other and the Florida cases. All P vivax strain had genetic signatures consistent with Central or South American parasites, and the Maryland P falciparum case had genetic signatures consistent with African parasites

Analysis of 783 Anopheles mosquitoes captured in all four states identified P vivax DNA in the abdomens of three Anopheles crucians mosquitoes captured from the same swamp in Sarasota County over three collection nights, suggesting the mosquitoes had recently fed on an infected person. 

The public health response included outreach to affected neighborhoods, overnight insecticide spraying targeting mosquito-breeding sites and areas where affected patients lived and worked, and distribution of bed nets and mosquito repellant. The CDC monitored the outbreaks, coordinated interstate technical support, and notified and offered training to local healthcare providers and laboratories.

""No additional locally acquired mosquito-transmitted malaria cases were detected following the illness-onset date (September 18, 2023) of the patient in Arkansas, and several factors suggested that no further local transmission occurred domestically in 2023,"" the authors wrote. 

Role of imported cases, higher temps
Although multiple factors were likely involved in the outbreaks, the authors note that preliminary data suggest there was a record high of 2,205 imported malaria cases in the United States in 2023, and that three of the states where the locally acquired cases occurred (Florida, Texas, and Maryland) are among those reporting the top quartile of imported cases. In addition, 2023 was the fifth-hottest US year on record.

""Seasonal increases of imported malaria during the summer months further intensify the potential for local transmission as competent vector populations simultaneously expand with increases in temperature,"" the researchers wrote.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759775407.0,A bold doctor sent her kids away and helped beat one of the world's deadliest viruses,"Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.

The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.

The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""

Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.

""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.

Soon it became clear.

This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.

On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.

Now, a year later, the basics of the outbreak in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered international renown as a model for a successful outbreak response.

Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost 9 out of every 10 patients. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.

Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.

After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.

A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.

She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""

Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.

""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.

Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had no approved treatment and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?

""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.

Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?

""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.

And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.

She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.

All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died."" [...] 

The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""

Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?

After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""

The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.

""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.

Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family. [...] 


""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.

Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?

""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.

Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.

""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.

In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.

""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""

She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.

""My three-year-old, he ran across the airport when he saw me and it was like this prolonged hug — he just did not want to let go of me,"" she recalls through tears. ""It was a feeling that I've never had before.""

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759783896.0,"CDC signs off on fall Covid shots. It may not be easy to get one, depending on where you live.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday updated its Covid vaccine guidance to recommend Covid shots for people 65 and older and only after they consult a doctor or pharmacist.

A press release from the agency said acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill signed off on the recommendations of an agency advisory panel last week, capping months of confusion and concern about this season’s Covid vaccine. Earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of the influential vaccine panel, replacing them with his own picks, many of whom have spoken out against Covid vaccines.

Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist who has falsely called the Covid vaccine the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” first moved to limit access to shots in May, when he bypassed the typical regulatory process and announced the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women.

The CDC’s sign-off on Monday does not mean people younger than 65 are barred from getting a Covid vaccine — they still can do so, after consulting with a doctor or pharmacist.

Adding in this so-called shared clinical decision-making essentially “puts up one more little barrier” to getting the shot, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University. “It’s kind of a vague term that says you should have your doctor or your provider or pharmacist tell you what the risks and benefits are before you get the vaccine.”

The CDC said that the vaccine panel's recommendations for people under 65 found the most benefit for someone at increased risk for severe Covid due to underlying conditions. The benefit of vaccination was lowest for people under 65 who aren't at increased risk for severe Covid.

But how easy it is to get a Covid shot may depend on where you live.

In previous years, states have generally mirrored the CDC’s vaccine guidance, particularly that of the vaccine advisory panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, which had been considered one of the foremost authorities on vaccinations.

Prior to the CDC’s announcement, 26 states (mostly blue states with Democratic governors) had already set their own Covid shot guidance to keep access as broad as possible, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.

The result is a complex hodgepodge of Covid vaccine policies nationwide.

“We now have had a breakdown in consensus between the federal government and the states as to how to manage Covid immunization,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We are facing an unprecedentedly complicated landscape.”

Illinois, Maryland and Washington, D.C., for example, officially recommend universal Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Other states, like California, Michigan and Minnesota, recommend the shots for everyone 3 years and older.

“Viruses don’t respect state borders,” Levy said. “From the perspective of protecting the public against infectious diseases, the last thing you would want as a strategy is to protect different states differently. It’s confusing, it’s inconsistent, and it leaves certain people vulnerable.”

What’s more, some doctors’ offices might not have any incentive to stock the vaccine since the CDC’s recommendation focuses on older adults. Last season, 23% of adults and 13% of children got the Covid vaccine, according to the CDC. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759703221.0,"It’s Just a Virus, the E.R. Told Him. Days Later, He Was Dead.","On Saturday, Sept. 16, 2023, Sam Terblanche, a junior at Columbia University, went to a soccer match at Yankee Stadium. On the subway ride there, he told friends he felt lousy. On Sunday, he went to the emergency room complaining of headache and chills. On Monday, sicker, he went again. On both visits, Sam was discharged with a reassuring prognosis: “Acute viral syndrome.”

Sam updated his parents by text as he was leaving the hospital on Monday night. “Just a bad virus, will have to advil, vomit, and hydrate it out,” he wrote.

“Ugh,” his father responded, “Good news re no major known problem (I guess).”

On Thursday, Sept. 21, Sam’s father, Villiers Terblanche, received a call from a Columbia dean. “When he said ‘I’ve got sad news,’ I knew something bad happened,” Terblanche recalled in a deposition. He had the call on speaker phone in the family’s living room. “It became really chaotic for a few minutes because Louise” — Sam’s mother — “was screaming with the most piercing primal scream I’ve heard in my life and Ben” — Sam’s younger brother — “lost it.”
Two years after Sam’s death, his father (who is known as “VT”), still can’t understand how his 20-year-old son could have sought help at the Mount Sinai Morningside emergency department twice in 24 hours then died alone in his dorm room two days later.

Terblanche met with the chief medical officer, Tracy Breen (who has since become the hospital’s president), two months after Sam died. He made a recording of the meeting and handed it over as part of pretrial discovery. In a well-lit room, seated at a conference table, Breen explained that after an internal review, Mount Sinai Morningside had concluded that it was “comfortable, satisfied, whatever totally non-helpful word we use” with its decision to discharge Sam from the E.R. It was a “gut punch,” Terblanche told me.

Breen conceded that Sam’s death was an emergency provider’s “worst nightmare” and would likely prompt staff to “wonder and feel, like ‘Did I get it wrong?’” At the same time, she informed Terblanche that the details of the review were off limits to him — “confidential and internal.”

Terblanche has been a lawyer his whole professional life, and he sees that meeting as a turning point. How can an executive acknowledge that the best doctors sometimes err while also insisting, without providing evidence, that the hospital was blameless? From that moment, he realized that if he wanted answers, he would have to fight. In August 2024, he sued Mount Sinai Morningside and five doctors who work there for medical malpractice and wrongful death. In a statement, Mount Sinai expressed sympathy for the Terblanche family but declined to comment on Sam’s case.

“Any patient loss profoundly affects not only families, but also the care teams who dedicate themselves to providing the highest quality care,” the statement said.

[...] 

Sam’s chart is 51 pages long, a catalog of billing codes and abbreviations, check-boxes and shorthand, updates and addenda. The record of the second visit contains numerous contradictions: Sam’s heart rate was documented at 126, yet Banerjee clicked the box “normal.” In one place it says Sam didn’t have a cough, while in another it says he did. The signatures of doctors who testified they never saw Sam — including one who was not in the hospital that night — accompany notes. Vital signs were ordered and not taken, as was an EKG.
Terblanche has read the record countless times, each time searching for clues. He finds the chart risible: Why would a physician decide to override an alert designed to protect Sam from danger?
Doctors talk about electronic medical records as an unpleasant and frustrating chore. They object to how the charts have evolved to prioritize billing and liability defense over clinical care. And they regard the symphony of well-meaning alerts and pop-ups as a distraction at best.

“Note bloat” refers to the volume of redundant and superfluous messages generated by an electronic medical chart. Automated prompts that assist in medical decision-making are still relatively unsophisticated, Kachalia, the patient safety executive at Johns Hopkins, explained in a phone call. “While they can help, the problem is they often over alert,” like a car that beeps when there’s an obstacle in the way and also when there isn’t, he said. These unreliable warnings can lead to “alert fatigue” and, sometimes, a mental habit of discounting them.
The emergency physicians I spoke to were largely sympathetic to the decision to override the sepsis alert. They reminded me that in 2023, late in the Covid era, E.R. waiting rooms were full of young patients with viral infections exhibiting fever, headache and nausea. The overwhelming majority would get better.

But they agreed, too, that the record of Sam’s care during his second visit is thin. The check boxes and templates can aid efficiency, several doctors told me, but they also may distract physicians from the patients right in front of them.

Even Breen, the Mount Sinai Morningside executive, conceded during her meeting with Terblanche that decision making was not “well captured in the medical record in general.” After Sam’s death, she told him, “one of the things we talked about with that team is maybe how to better capture that, just to tell your story better.”

Largely absent from Sam’s chart is the “why.” Sam was feeling worse. Why did Agyare assert from the outset that Sam was “unlikely to require admission,” as the health record said? Sam ran short of breath from walking, told at least one doctor that he had a cough, and he couldn’t keep food or drink down. What rationale did Agyare have not to order the antibiotics as a precaution? He explained his thinking in his deposition. Other than a little fever and a high heart rate, Sam’s physical exam “was entirely unremarkable,” he said.

And Agyare said he didn’t order a chest X-ray because Sam’s lungs sounded fine. “The patient was not in respiratory distress. His breath rate was within normal limits,” he said.

[...] 

Sam’s lab results started coming in after 9 p.m. Of the more than 70 results listed in his chart, nearly three dozen are flagged with little arrows and exclamation points as “abnormal.” But in deposition testimony, Agyare said that in Sam’s case these flags were not clinically concerning. The emergency doctors I spoke with largely agreed; “no smoking gun,” one of them said. 

There is no single blood test for sepsis. Sam’s white blood cell count was normal, and in sepsis it is often high (or in the case of overwhelming sepsis, very low). His lactate, another marker for sepsis, was also normal.

There’s a saying in medicine: “When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses, not zebras.” A patient’s symptoms usually support the most plausible diagnosis, not the rare possibility. Villiers Terblanche believes his son died of sepsis, a leading cause of death in hospitals and notoriously hard to diagnose.
Benjamin Miko, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Columbia University, is prepared to testify as an expert witness in Sam’s case. The electronic health record warned of sepsis in two different ways, he told me, “so it’s not really up to the doctors to say, ‘We don’t want to do an X-ray. We don’t want to do antibiotics.’”

But Sam’s autopsy report is inconclusive on the role of sepsis. According to the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, the primary cause of Sam’s death was “pulmonary hemorrhage of unknown etiology”: he bled massively from his lungs, but the examiner could not say why. A blood culture taken on Sam’s second E.R. visit did not grow out, meaning if Sam had a dangerous infection it was not yet detectable in his blood. Sam’s heart, post mortem, was enlarged, as was his liver. His spleen was congested. His kidney showed tissue damage. (Sam’s toxicology screen was negative.)

David Strayer, an expert autopsy pathologist who coedited the medical textbook “Rubin’s Pathology,” reviewed the medical documents in this case. (He is the father of Reuben, the E.R. doctor and blogger.) Strayer didn’t see the pathology slides, but believes that sepsis is an unlikely culprit in Sam’s death. He thinks Sam was a zebra, the rare patient with an outlier diagnosis: an autoimmune disease, a clotting disorder or an outsized reaction to something he ingested or drank. An additional autopsy by the Cleveland Clinic suggested the possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid. Sam had Covid several weeks earlier, though at the hospital he tested negative.

Overall, Sam’s lab values were off. His platelets, red blood cells and hemoglobin were low. (“He’s a 20-year-old guy. His red blood counts should not be low. He doesn’t have a monthly period. He doesn’t have a gaping wound,” Strayer said.) His sodium was low. His glucose was high. His creatinine, which measures kidney function, was “within normal limits,” but high for a person his age. His urinalysis showed the presence of blood and elevated white cells.
Sam’s lab results “do indicate that something serious is going on there. And it’s not at all clear what it is,” Strayer said.

But how do emergency doctors act on this level of complexity in their high-volume, fast turnover environments? Should they be expected to follow mysterious blood results over days? Or phone patients after discharge to check up on them? The realities of hospital crowding make doctors reluctant to insist on hospital admission when the particulars don’t obviously seem to merit it.

An E.R. doctor can insist that a patient follow up with a primary care doctor, said Raven, of U.C.S.F. Sometimes she will keep a patient for observation, or to recheck values that may be concerning, she added. At Mount Sinai Morningside, doctors in the pediatric E.R., where Sam was treated, don’t have that capacity, Agyare said in his deposition: “You have to make a decision on them. Either coming into the hospital or being discharged.” [...] 

Around 10:30 p.m., after the hospital shift change, Neil Makhijani, another resident, took over from Banerjee and stopped by bed 36 to check on Sam. By then, Charlie Sagner had finished his homework and was sitting next to him, chatting. “Patient reassessed. Reports feeling better,” Makhijani’s note said. He spoke to Sam about his lab results. Sam felt reassured: “Tested normal on all blood stuff,” he wrote to his parents.

Sam told Makhijani that he was ready to go home. “I think he was, just kind of like, ‘Get me out of here,’” Charlie told me. “There weren’t any obvious signs that he still, like, wasn’t right.” The doctor ordered a second liter of IV fluids and started the discharge work. In the “diagnosis” field, he repeated the earlier conclusion, “acute viral syndrome.”

The discharge document said, “If you develop any new or worsening symptoms, or the symptoms you still have persist for longer than we discussed, you should return to the Emergency Department immediately.” It noted that Sam should follow up with a primary care physician. Sam’s heart rate was still abnormally high, but he was able to keep food and drink down. Makhijani gave him an excuse note saying he would be ready to return to school by Wednesday. He also gave Sam a copy of his lab results, which Sam stacked in a neat pile on his desk.

Courtney Mangus, an emergency physician at the University of Michigan, emphasized how important it is for doctors to level with patients when they’re not sure of a diagnosis. Such honesty can help patients overcome feeling “sheepish” about going back a third time, she said, speaking in general terms.

“I cant believe i still just have a virus,” Sam wrote to his friends as he left the hospital. “How anticlimatic. I really thought i was dying”

Later that night, he wrote to Kayla: “First thing im havign when i can eat again is chick fil a”

This is the part that haunts Sam’s family and closest friends. Sam went to the E.R. because he felt sick. Then he went back, sicker. The doctors told him he had a virus. He — and everyone he knew — believed them. “I went with Sam to the hospital and they said it was fine,” Charlie told me. “So I didn’t have much reason to doubt what was going on because I trusted the hospital to do its job.” In his last days, Sam was quarantining. He didn’t want his friends to catch what he had.

On Tuesday, Sam woke up feeling somewhat better. By text, he asked his parents what he should eat.
“plain bagels,” wrote his father.

“Chicken is really good,” suggested his mother.
Delirium set in that afternoon. “I miss human society,” he texted Kayla around 7 p.m. “I convincrd myself i was tue head of the vikings,” he wrote. “I need to stop making religions. I convince myself I have a following All under the covers with me.”

“LMAO,” wrote Kayla. And then: “hang in there pls.”
On Wednesday, Sam’s parents checked in again. His father wondered, “how is the patient doing,” and reminded Sam to say happy birthday to Ben. By text, Kayla started sending Sam cartoon animals with hearts for eyes. His absence was making her anxious, she wrote, and she needed him to be more in touch.

“I will check innmore,” he wrote. “I promise.”

“When is this gonna end?” she asked.

“Will talk when I’m up again,” Sam wrote. “Idek.”
When Sam didn’t respond to her texts Thursday morning, Kayla called Charlie, who informed campus security.

The depositions in the case of Terblanche v. Mount Sinai Morningside began in January, 2025. VT always attends. He knows it’s naïve, but he wishes that someone in the room would drop their defensiveness and take some accountability for what happened to Sam. The Mount Sinai Morningside doctors are well prepped. Their answers are cautious and unembellished.

VT finds some of these sessions so anguishing that he takes the next day off and rides 60 or 70 miles on his bike. He calls these his “antidepressant bike rides.”

For Louise, too, the legal machinations are heartbreaking. Every deposition — relayed by her husband who takes copious notes — brings back memories of the day when she stood in the corner of Sam’s dorm room holding his pillow while his friends ripped his posters off the walls. The picture of Sam’s last week has come into focus bit by bit.

“The fact that we all just think it was preventable is just horrendous,” she told me. “And then also, I mean, I don’t think we’ll ever know what he died of. We don’t know what the infection was. Maybe it was something horrible and maybe he would have died anyway. But the fact that he died alone without help. That, for me, is hard.” [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759675761.0,"Fiji's HIV cases surge due to bluetoothing, chemsex and needle-sharing","Ten: that's the age of the youngest person with HIV that Sesenieli Naitala has ever met.

When she first started Fiji's Survivor Advocacy Network in 2013, that young boy was yet to be born. Now he is one of thousands of Fijians to have contracted the bloodborne virus in recent years – many of them aged 19 or younger, and many of them through intravenous drug use.

""More young people are using drugs,"" Ms Naitala, whose organisation provides support to sex workers and drug users in the Fijian capital Suva, tells the BBC. ""He (the boy) was one of those young people that were sharing needles on the street during Covid.""

Over the past five years, Fiji – a tiny South Pacific nation with a population of less than a million – has become the locus of one of the world's fastest growing HIV epidemics.

In 2014, the country had fewer than 500 people living with HIV. By 2024 that number had soared to approximately 5,900 – an elevenfold leap.

That same year, Fiji recorded 1,583 new cases – a thirteenfold increase on its usual five-year average. Of those, 41 were aged 15 or younger, compared to just 11 in 2023.

Such figures prompted the country's minister for health and medical services to declare an HIV outbreak in January. Last week, assistant health minister Penioni Ravunawa warned Fiji may record more than 3,000 new HIV cases by the end of 2025.

""This is a national crisis,"" he said. ""And it is not slowing down.""

The BBC spoke to multiple experts, advocates and frontline workers about the reasons for such a meteoric rise in case numbers. Several pointed out that, as awareness around HIV spreads and stigma diminishes, more people have been coming forward and getting tested.

At the same time though, they also noted that countless more remain invisible to the official figures – and that the true scale of the issue is likely much bigger than even the record-breaking numbers suggest.

Underpinning Fiji's HIV epidemic is a spiralling trend of drug use, unsafe sex, needle sharing and ""bluetoothing"".

Otherwise known as ""hotspotting"", this latter term refers to a practice where an intravenous drug user withdraws their blood after a hit and injects it into a second person – who may then do the same for a third, and so on.

Kalesi Volatabu, executive director for the NGO Drug Free Fiji, has seen it happen firsthand. Last May, she was on one of her regular early morning walks through the Fijian capital of Suva, offering support and education to drug users on the streets, when she turned a corner and saw a group of seven or eight people huddling together.

""I saw the needle with the blood – it was right there in front of me,"" she recalls. ""This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood – and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing. 

""It's not just needles they're sharing – they're sharing the blood.""

Bluetoothing has also been reported in South Africa and Lesotho, two countries with some of the world's highest rates of HIV. In Fiji, the practice became popular within the past few years, according to both Ms Volatabu and Ms Naitala.

[...] 

In August 2024, Fiji's Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MOH) recognised bluetoothing as one of the drivers for the country's rise in HIV cases. Another was chemsex, where people use drugs - often methamphetamine - before and during sexual encounters.

In Fiji, unlike most other countries around the world, crystal meth is predominantly consumed via intravenous injection.

MOH also found that of the 1,093 new cases recorded in the first nine months of 2024, 223 – about 20% – were from intravenous drug use.

Fiji has become a major Pacific trafficking hub for crystal meth over the past 15 years. A large part of this is due to the country's geographic location between East Asia and the Americas – some of the world's biggest manufacturers of the drug - and Australia and New Zealand – the world's highest-paying markets.

During that same period, meth has spilled into and spread throughout local communities, developing into a crisis that, like HIV, was recently declared a ""national emergency"".

And according to those on the frontlines, the age of users is trending downwards.

""We see more and more of these young people,"" says Ms Volatabu. ""They are getting younger and younger.""

Fiji's most recent national HIV statistics cite injectable drug use as the most common known mode of transmission, accounting for 48% of cases. Sexual transmission accounted for 47% of cases, while mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy and childbirth was cited as the cause of most paediatric cases. [...] 

José Sousa-Santos, head of the Pacific Regional Security Hub at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, says ""a perfect storm is brewing"".

""The concern is across all levels of society and government in regards to Fiji's HIV crisis – not just what's happening at the moment, but where it's going to be in three years' time and the lack of Fiji's resources,"" he tells the BBC. ""The support systems - the nursing, the ability to distribute or to access the drugs for treatment of HIV - just aren't there.

""That's what terrifies us, the people that work in the region: there is no way that Fiji can deal with this.""

Following its declaration of an outbreak in January, the Fijian government has sought to improve its HIV surveillance and enhance its ability to address the likely underreporting of cases.

The Global Alert and Response Network, which was called upon to provide that support, stated in a recent report that ""addressing these pressing issues through a well-coordinated national response is crucial in reversing the trajectory of the HIV epidemic in Fiji"".

That report also noted that staffing shortages, communication issues, challenges with lab equipment and stockouts of HIV rapid tests and medicines were impacting screening, diagnosis and treatment.

Data collection is slow, difficult and error-prone, it added – hampering efforts to understand the extent of Fiji's HIV epidemic and the efficacy of the outbreak response.

That leaves many experts, authorities and everyday Fijians in the dark. And Mr Sousa-Santos is predicting an ""avalanche"" of cases still to come. [...] ",1nyq71v,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o,140
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759675528.0,"SC measles outbreak centered around Upstate school, health official says","The South Carolina measles outbreak centers around a school in the Upstate, a state health official announced Oct. 3. And more cases are expected as it is also likely spreading in the community.

S.C. Department of Public Health officials would not identify the school or the county where the outbreak of at least five confirmed cases is anchored, citing privacy concerns. But parents at the school have been notified and the department is working to make vaccinations more available there, Dr. Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, said.

South Carolina is now among more than 40 states that have seen 42 different outbreaks of measles so far this year, with 1,544 cases as of Sept. 30, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Of those, 92 percent have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, the CDC noted.

The state’s last measles outbreak was in 2018.

The cases came to light about a week ago and public health is working to determine if other cases are out there, she said.

“There's a high risk in these congregate settings for transmission, and it also makes it difficult to identify all of the close contacts,” Bell said. “So that's an ongoing investigation.”

With at least a couple of cases the source is unknown and possibly outside the school setting, she said.

There have been eight confirmed measles cases so far this year in South Carolina with that number doubling in roughly a week.

Details of the death first came on the Alberta government’s online measle dashboard.

Alberta Health Minister Adriana LaGrange, in a statement, said she “hoped this moment would not come.”

“I am saddened to share that we have had our first death from measles in the province. A child, born prematurely after the mother contracted measles during pregnancy, died shortly after birth,” she said.

“This is a heartbreaking loss, and no words can capture the pain of losing a child. My sincere condolences go to the family during this profoundly difficult time.”

She added children under five years old, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems face the highest risk from measles.

“Measles during pregnancy can lead to serious complications, including miscarriage, preterm labour, stillbirth, and congenital infection. Anyone planning a pregnancy should ensure they have received two doses of measles-containing vaccine prior to conception, as vaccination during pregnancy is not recommended.”

LaGrange did not provide any information about where in the province the patients resided.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759349027.0,"Long Covid Risk for Children Doubles After a Second Infection, Study Finds","Children and teenagers are twice as likely to develop long Covid after a second coronavirus infection as after an initial infection, a large new study has found.

The study, of nearly a half-million people under 21, published Tuesday in Lancet Infectious Diseases, provides evidence that Covid reinfections can increase the risk of long-term health consequences and contradicts the idea that being infected a second time might lead to a milder outcome, medical experts said.

Dr. Laura Malone, director of the Pediatric Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study, said the findings echo the experience of patients in her clinic.

“Just because you got through your first infection and didn’t develop long Covid, it’s not that you are completely out of the woods,” she said.

The study, conducted as part of the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER Initiative, examined electronic medical records for about 465,000 young people at 40 children’s hospitals in the United States. They had either a first or a second coronavirus infection between Jan. 1, 2022, and Oct. 13, 2023. The study focused on the Omicron wave, but researchers said the conclusions are most likely relevant to more recent variants.

The authors counted how many young people received a specific diagnostic code for long Covid that was added to the International Classification of Diseases in October 2021. The rate over a six-month period showed that 1,884 per million young people developed long Covid after two infections, twice the rate of 904 per million for young people with one infection.

“Reinfection really increases the risk,” said Yong Chen, the study’s senior author, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Computing, Inference and Learning Lab. “Your body really has a memory system and is really going to be hurt from recurrent infection.”

The study also found that tens of thousands of young people who did not receive a long Covid diagnosis were treated for conditions that can be symptoms of long Covid, including respiratory problems and abdominal pain. As a result, Dr. Chen said, the diagnostic code most likely captured only “a subset of the long Covid. [...] ",1nvivlp,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/health/long-covid-children.html,218
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759354634.0,HHS to furlough 41% of workforce during federal government shutdown,"Federal health officials say critical activities related to public health emergencies will continue despite the federal government shutdown, but other areas of the federal health bureaucracy will be significantly affected by furloughs unless lawmakers can resolve the impasse.

In a post this morning on the social media site X, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said activities related to ""imminent threats to the safety of human life or protection of property"" will continue, including detecting and responding to public health emergencies, managing recalls, mitigating drug shortages, responding to foodborne illness and infectious disease outbreaks, and conducting surveillance of adverse events that could cause human harm.

The FDA said its ability to protect and promote public health and safety will still be significantly impacted, however, with many activities delayed or paused for the length of the shutdown. A document posted on the FDA website says the agency will not be accepting new or generic drug applications, conducting some its regulatory science research, or working on longer-term food safety initiatives, among other activities.

The government shutdown began early Wednesday morning amid a dispute over a temporary spending package that would have kept the government funded until the end of November. Congressional Democrats say they will not agree to the spending package until Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers but don't have enough votes to pass the package on their own, agree to extend federal health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Hundreds of thousands of government employees will be furloughed.

This is the first government shutdown since 2018. That shutdown, which stretched into early 2019, lasted for 35 days.

**Surveillance, communication will be affected**

Overall, 32,460 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are set to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an HHS fiscal year 2026 contingency plan, representing 41% of the agency's workforce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are among the HHS divisions that will be affected.

""HHS will cease all non-exempt and non-excepted activities in the event of a lapse in appropriation,"" the document states. ""This includes, but is not limited to, oversight of extramural research contracts and grants, being able to process FOIA requests or public inquiries, data collection, validation, and analysis. More specifically, CDC communication to the American public about health-related information will be hampered, CMS will be unable to provide oversight to major contractors, and NIH will not have the ability to admit new patients to the Clinical Center, except for whom it is medically necessary.""

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, some of the non-exempt activities at CDC include analysis of surveillance data for reportable diseases, applied public health research, and guidance to state and local health departments on certain programs. But non-furloughed staff will continue to respond to public health emergencies and support certain programs, including the Vaccines for Children program and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief. Grantmaking, basic research, and some veterinary research at NIH will be put on pause.

There is also a threat the Trump administration might use the shutdown as an excuse to permanently fire certain government employees. Politico reports that the Office of Management and Budget has instructed agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans that would go beyond standard furloughs for programs with no alternative sources of funding.

""We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues,"" Vice President JD Vance said today at a White House press briefing.

In a letter last week to Congress, IDSA President Tina Tan, MD, and HIV Medicine Association Chair-elect Anna Person, MD, said a government shutdown and additional cuts to the federal health workforce would endanger the public's health.

It is the first whooping cough death reported in Mississippi since 2012 and the third since 2008. 

Whooping cough cases in Mississippi are the highest they have been in at least a decade.

The infant was not eligible to be vaccinated against the disease due to his or her age, the agency said in a statement. 

State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney has repeatedly said that vaccines are the best defense against diseases like pertussis.

Because infants are not eligible for the pertussis vaccination until they are two months old, the health department recommends that pregnant women, grandparents and family or friends who may come in close contact with an infant get booster shots to ensure they do not pass the illness to children.

This year, 115 pertussis cases have been reported to the health department, compared to 49 total last year. 

Over 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported across the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...]

In a statement, the SCDPH said the patient doesn’t have any known exposure to an earlier case, and the individual has completed the isolation period. An investigation is underway to identify contacts and notify people who may have been exposed. It added that the patient’s illness has no known connection to the state’s three earlier cases.

Elsewhere, the New York State Department of Health on September 27 issued a measles alert after the virus was detected in wastewater earlier in the week from a treatment center that serves the city of Oswego and surrounding areas in the upstate area. Health officials urged health providers to be aware and look for clinical signs and symptoms. 

James McDonald, MD, MPH, state health commissioner, said in the statement, “This detection does not mean there is an outbreak. It is, however, a timely reminder to make sure you and your family are up to date on the MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine and to keep an eye out for symptoms.""

In international developments, Israel’s health ministry yesterday reported the death of a sixth child—an unvaccinated toddler—in the country’s ongoing outbreak. Four of the six deaths were reported over the past week. All of the children were younger than 30 months old.

So far, 24 patients have been hospitalized, mostly children younger than 6 years old who aren’t vaccinated. Seven of them are in the intensive care unit (ICU). The outbreak areas are Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, Bnei Brak, Harish, Modi’in Illit, Nof HaGalil, Kiryat Gat, and Ashdod.

The health ministry urged unvaccinated people, as well as parents of infants who have only received one MMR vaccine dose, to avoid large gatherings. Officials are offering walk-in vaccine clinics as part of the outbreak response.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759183417.0,Pakistan's polio fight suffers a blow with 2 new cases reported in the south,"KARACHI, Pakistan -- Pakistan reported two new polio cases in the southern province of Sindh, health officials said Monday, a blow to efforts aimed at eradicating the crippling disease among children. This brings the total to 29 cases across the country since January, despite several immunization drives.

The virus was detected in two young girls in the cities of Badin and Thatta, according to a statement from the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program.

Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where transmission of the wild poliovirus has never been stopped, according to the World Health Organization. Some parents in Pakistan still refuse to vaccinate their children, while others live in hard-to-access areas, experts say.

Meanwhile, health workers sometimes suffer life-threatening attacks when trying to reach households in former militant strongholds in the country’s restive northwest. In February, gunmen killed a police officer assigned to protect a vaccination team in Jamrud, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks.

Authorities said nearly 21 million children under the age of five were vaccinated during a campaign earlier this month. Another nationwide, weeklong door-to-door drive is set to begin Oct. 13, targeting 45 million children.

Polio is a highly infectious, incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. Pakistan has been reporting an average of about three new cases each month since January.

The WHO and its partners launched the global polio eradication initiative in 1988, following the notable precedent set by the elimination of smallpox in 1980. The effort came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases were reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But cases have since rebounded, rising to 99 last year, and Pakistan has repeatedly missed eradication deadlines.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1759080273.0,"As my daughter got sicker and sicker, our quest for answers dragged on. How did we all miss the bacteria taking over her body?","There are many reasons to feel guilty. I’m a nature writer who preaches about the importance of wild childhoods, and my daughter has been made chronically ill by one trip to the countryside. I’m a journalist whose job it is to interrogate information and yet I didn’t demand better answers for her from NHS doctors. But the guilt is most painful when I remember a freezing wet day in October 2021.

Milly’s U10s football club were playing the league’s top team. Milly, player of the year the previous season, a whirl of blond energy across the pitch, had lost her enthusiasm for the beautiful game. That morning, she really didn’t want to play: she was tearful and exhausted. There was nothing obviously wrong: no cough, sickness, temperature. Her twin, Esme, was playing but without Milly the team were a player short. I told Milly they needed her. Stoic, she staggered off but couldn’t step on to the pitch. Instead, she curled into a ball of misery and fatigue beside her coach. The rain fell. Her team lost 15-1.

I cringe when I flick through the notebook where I recorded my daughters’ football matches (I was tragically keen). Below most results from the 21/22 season, I’ve written “Milly ill” or, worse, “Milly played ¼” or “Milly played ½”. All the time, cajoled or compelled to lead her “normal” life, Milly was getting sicker and sicker. We had no idea what was wrong. Every morning she looked terrible, dark circles beneath her eyes. She complained of perpetual tiredness, talked of being “disconcentrated” – she later learned to call this “brain fog” – and mentioned strange stabbing pains, mostly in her feet when she walked. Soon, she was too ill to go to school. Lockdown was over but it had become a permanent state for Milly, my wife, Lisa, and me.

What we didn’t know then, and wouldn’t discover until this spring, was that Milly’s body was being invaded by an insidious bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, which hides in connective tissue, confounding immune systems, wreaking havoc. Milly had Lyme disease, which takes its name from Old Lyme, a coastal town in Connecticut. This bacterial infection is not contagious but is transmitted by a tick, a tiny, blood-sucking insect that hops on to human skin in the countryside, where it is transported by other mammals, particularly deer. There are 476,000, and rising, annual cases in North America alone. Global heating is making ticks, their bacteria – and human illnesses – much more prevalent. [...] 

Most established medical thinking questions the existence of so-called “chronic Lyme disease”. The numbers of people diagnosed with Lyme disease tell their own story. The UK Health Security Agency logged 1,581 confirmed cases of Lyme in 2024. But according to Jack Lambert, consultant in infectious diseases at the Mater hospital in Ireland, France records 70,000 cases a year. “In both the UK and France, 5-10% of ticks are found to carry borrelia. So ticks only like to bite French people?” Lambert says. “Or maybe the UK is under-reporting. Ticks are all over the place. We have all these people with mystery illnesses – summer flu, migratory arthritis, funny neurological problems. And for GPs, neurologists, rheumatologists and infectious disease experts asking why, Lyme disease is at the bottom of the list.”

How did we and everyone else miss the bacteria silently taking over Milly’s body? Back in 2021, Lisa took her to the GP. It was a relief when blood tests ruled out various life-threatening possibilities – it wasn’t cancer, thank goodness. On account of the stabbing pains, we had an appointment with a neurologist, who was unhelpful and never considered Lyme. Our requests for a second opinion from a general paediatrician were rejected.

Nine-year-old Milly was not only a footballer; she also adored dance and swimming, and loved school. We still joke she is one of those annoying people who excels at whatever they do (she doesn’t get that from me). Her uncle nicknamed her “Mensa Milly” because she was laser-quick at maths and English. She was also dreamy and creative, sociable, angelically kind and possessed of a very silly sense of humour and the most infectious giggle. We don’t hear that so much now.[...] 

Not everyone was so understanding. I don’t blame them. We didn’t understand Milly’s illness either. As time went on, she became more and more withdrawn. What was wrong with her? Was she just anxious? Was it all in her head? Could we encourage her to get up and go out? We clung to our reality: Milly was a vibrant, energetic girl who loved life and got sick.

Eventually, the NHS diagnosis came through: ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome). This was frustrating. Milly had become unwell just after a global pandemic. Occam’s razor – the principle that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one – suggested she had long Covid. We believed she caught the virus in the summer of 2021, but was undiagnosed. Shortly after, we were refused an antibody test, then Milly definitely got Covid with the rest of her family in early 2022.

We consoled ourselves that there seemed no great advantage in being attached to a long Covid clinic. The NHS help for both long Covid and ME/CFS, in our region at least, is minimal. There is no cure and no monitoring. The expert assigned to Milly moved jobs; we have not been offered an appointment with the specialist clinic since February 2024. We were given the usual advice about pacing – gradually increasing exercise – which is challenged by some ME patient groups.

As a diagnosis without a treatment pathway, ME/CFS is a dangerous predicament. The syndrome is clearly an umbrella term for different illnesses that are poorly understood by modern medicine. We met people who had recovered thanks to talking cures. One told me his ME disappeared when he took a course of psychological treatment in his 20s and understood what he had to gain from being “tired” all the time: respite from being under pressure and daunted by the world. What did Milly have to gain from being tired, we wondered? Why would a nine-year-old decide to be ill? Were we, without meaning to, putting her under too much pressure?

[...] 

As she turned 13, it was Milly who took the decisive step to discover what was really wrong with her. After hearing about Miranda Hart’s health struggles, she bought her audiobook. In I Haven’t Been Entirely Honest With You, the comedian writes of her 30-year battle with debilitating fatigue and disbelieving doctors, with the eventual revelation that she was suffering from Lyme disease. Unusually, Milly asked me and Lisa to read Hart’s book. She really identified with her.

“Did we get Milly tested for Lyme?” I asked Lisa. It had crossed our minds before. Lisa checked the GP’s blood tests and found everything was looked at in the early stages. Milly was negative: she had no Lyme antibodies.

What we didn’t know then was that there are so many medical shibboleths around Lyme. These, the few real experts in the disease believe, are almost certainly causing thousands of cases to be missed in Britain alone. We only knew what most people understand about Lyme: if you’re bitten by a tick, look out for a bull’s-eye rash (it can also be solid red). If you find one, take an antibiotic called doxycycline and you will be cured.

This is all true for many people but, unfortunately, this disease is much more complex. You may not be aware you’ve been bitten by a tick. A survey by the Lyme Resource Centre found that 41% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease could not recall receiving a tick bite at all. This is not carelessness: even a tick’s grain-of-sand-sized aphids can transmit the disease. Once you’re bitten, you may not develop a rash at all. If you’re treated with antibiotics, you may not get better. And if you have an NHS blood test, known as Elisa, it gives false negatives about 50% of the time. It looks for antibodies – but Lyme bacteria hides, and can fool the body into not producing them. This is what happened to Milly.

Around the time we read Hart’s story, Lisa heard on a Long Covid Kids charity discussion group about a private doctor having good results with some patients. After waiting probably far too long, we paid for a second opinion from him. In December we attended a London clinic that felt more like a spa. Dr Ben Sinclair is a personable former prison doctor in his 40s. He caught long Covid and successfully treated himself; later he discovered he also had Lyme disease. Since April 2024, he and his small team have held consultations with 2,500 patients who present with symptoms of long Covid or Lyme or both. There may be a link: in many sufferers, Sinclair told us, Covid suppressed their immune system, allowing Lyme bacteria lurking at unproblematically low levels within the body to rapidly multiply (a study found that 13.5% of people in western Europe have serological evidence of the bacteria in their bodies). [...] 

Rather than the Elisa test, Sinclair recommended a T-spot test, measuring the T-cell interferon response (a type of white blood cell) to bacterial antigens. It’s the gold standard for testing for tuberculosis, a bacteria that similarly creeps around the body, hiding in tissues and organs. The tests are not available on the NHS and we would have to dispatch bloods to a German lab. We stepped out of the consulting room in a daze and treated Milly to a quick look at the Jellycats of Selfridges before getting the train home. I felt like crying. Later, I did. [...] 

The medical establishment doesn’t recognise chronic Lyme disease, Embers says, because it is so tricky, with symptoms that can be autoimmune issues, inflammation or persistent infection. Lambert says doctors must treat all three, and while medical guidelines caution against using antibiotics over the long term, some doctors are willing to consider treatment for up to a year – if the patient is improving.

Similarly, Sinclair says 60–70% of his patients make a good recovery with a combination of antibiotics. “I’ve never made the claim that I can cure people,” he says. “But what I try to do is restore function, reduce symptoms and get people into a balance where their immune system should do the work.” [...] 

The mental scars run deep. But we hope Milly will physically recover. If her immune system can be repaired and conquer the borrelia, she could live an active, “normal” life. We are not sure whether she will ever reintegrate into school. And yet I collect stories of how childhood sickness has been a font of creativity for the person who recovers in adulthood, and I hope.

We have a diagnosis, we have treatment and we have hope. Most hopefully of all, occasionally, in early evening, Milly starts mucking about with her brother. I hear an explosion of infectious giggling. The Milly giggle. She’s still here. She’s still Milly. How lucky are we to have her in our lives.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758920776.0,CDC reports highlight 2024-25 flu season's deadly impact on US kids,"Two new reports this week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide more detail on the deadliest flu season for US children in more than a decade.

The reports, published yesterday in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), include data on the 280 US children who died during the 2024-25 flu season, along with information on 109 children who died from a rare and severe neurologic complication of flu during the season. The 280 pediatric flu deaths are the highest number reported in the United States since the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic and the highest for a non-pandemic flu season since child deaths became nationally notifiable in 2004.

The reports add further information on what the CDC has previously described as a high-severity flu season.

In first report, researchers with the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases analyzed data from the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System, which collects reports on pediatric flu deaths from state and local health departments. The analysis includes information on flu virus types, underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and healthcare use during illness.

The 280 children who died with flu from September 29, 2024 to September 13, 2025, represent a national rate of 3.8 deaths per 1 million children. The median age at time of death was 7 years, and 61% of deaths occurred in children under the age of 9 years. The influenza-associated mortality rate was highest overall in infants under 6 months of age (11.1 per 1 million), higher among girls (4.5) than boys (3.1). Among racial and ethnic groups, Black children (5.8) had the highest mortality rate.

Influenza A viruses were associated with 240 deaths (86%) and influenza B viruses with 38 (14%). Of the 169 influenza A deaths with a known subtype, 95 (56%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 73 (43%) were A(H3N2) viruses, and one (less than 1%) had both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) detected.

Among the 262 children with available medical histories, 148 (56%) had at least one reported underlying medical condition, with neurologic conditions the most frequently reported (93; 63%). Among the 218 children with available data on clinical complications before death, the most common complication was sepsis (108; 50%), followed by pneumonia (82; 38%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (60; 28%), seizures (53; 24%), and encephalopathy or encephalitis (40; 18%).

Overall, 112 (40%) of children were treated with flu antiviral medications, most commonly oseltamivir (104; 93%). Roughly half of the children who died had not been admitted to the hospital at the time of their death, with 61 (22%) deaths occurring outside of the hospital and 74 (27%) in the emergency department.

Of the 208 children with vaccine information available, 89% had not been fully vaccinated against flu. 

The authors of the report say that while it's unclear why there were more pediatric deaths in the 2024-25 flu season than previous seasons, the best way to protect children from flu, particularly those with underlying conditions, is to get them vaccinated.

""All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should receive an annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza and its complications, including influenza-associated death,"" they wrote.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758916577.0,Zika virus may raise long-term risks of type 2 diabetes – new study,"It has been ten years since Brazil faced a major outbreak of the Zika virus. The alert was given in 2015, when the country’s north-eastern states reported a sudden increase in the number of babies born with unusually small heads – a condition called microcephaly.

Obstetrician Adriana Melo was working in a maternity ward in Paraíba when she noticed something strange during routine ultrasounds. More and more foetuses had microcephaly. She suspected a link to the Zika virus, which was just starting to circulate in Brazil.

Melo collected samples of amniotic fluid and sent them for testing. The results confirmed her suspicions, making her one of the first doctors to prove that Zika infection in pregnancy could cause serious brain malformations. This discovery was crucial for both Brazilian and international health authorities and triggered a global effort to control the epidemic.

A decade on, research into Zika has moved forward. Scientists have long studied how the virus harms the developing brain, but until now its effects on the adult brain were less clear. Together with Giselle Passos and Iranaia Assunção-Miranda from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and colleagues at the Brain Institute of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul and the Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine in Sweden, we have discovered that Zika can also infect a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and cause long-lasting problems with insulin.

The hypothalamus is a small but crucial part of the brain that helps control things like hunger, temperature, heart rate and metabolism. In our study, we found that Zika reaches the hypothalamus and triggers inflammation, activates immune cells in the brain called microglia and causes persistent problems with how insulin works. Insulin helps the body control blood sugar, so when it doesn’t work properly, it can lead to type 2 diabetes.

Our research, which was recently accepted for publication in the journal Cell Death and Disease, shows that even after inflammation subsides, the brain’s insulin resistance persists.

In experiments on adult mice, Zika infection led to a strong immune response in the hypothalamus and disrupted the balance of hormones that regulate blood sugar. These results suggest that people who have had Zika may face a higher risk of long-term metabolic problems, even after they recover from the initial infection.

This fits with what we know about Zika and other viruses. Zika belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which includes dengue, another mosquito-borne virus. Previous studies have shown that Zika can damage both the developing and adult brain, causing conditions like myelitis or encephalomyelitis. Research in mice has demonstrated that Zika can persist in the hypothalamus, affect hormone systems that control growth and reproduction, and even reduce fertility.

Similar disruptions in insulin signalling have also been seen with other viral infections, including influenza, COVID, HIV, hepatitis C and dengue. This highlights the importance of closely monitoring viral outbreaks and their potential long-term effects on health.

Our findings suggest that Zika infection should now be considered not just as an immediate risk to the developing foetus, but also as a potential contributor to metabolic problems like type 2 diabetes in adults.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758836263.0,AI just created a working virus. The U.S. isn’t prepared for that.,"We’re nowhere near ready for a world in which artificial intelligence can create a working virus, but we need to be — because that’s the world we’re now living in.

In a remarkable paper released this month, scientists at Stanford University showed that computers can design new viruses that can then be created in the lab. How is that possible? Think of ChatGPT, which learned to write by studying patterns in English. The Stanford team used the same idea on the fundamental building block of life, training “genomic language models” on the DNA of bacteriophages — viruses that infect bacteria but not humans — to see whether a computer could learn their genetic grammar well enough to write something new.

Turns out it could. The AI created novel viral genomes, which the researchers then built and tested on a harmless strain of E. coli. Many of them worked. Some were even stronger than their natural counterparts, and several succeeded in killing bacteria that had evolved resistance to natural bacteriophages.

The scientists proceeded with appropriate caution. They limited their work to viruses that can’t infect humans and ran experiments under strict safety rules. But the essential fact is hard to ignore: Computers can now invent viable — even potent — viruses.

The Stanford paper is a preprint that has not yet undergone peer review, but this advance suggests enormous promise. The same tools that can conjure new viruses could one day be harnessed to cure disease. Viruses could be engineered to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the great crises in global health. Cocktails of diverse AI-designed viruses could treat infections that no existing drug can touch.

But there is no sugarcoating the risks. While the Stanford team played it safe, what’s to stop others from using open data on human pathogens to build their own models? And if that happens, the same techniques could just as easily be used to create viruses lethal to humans — turning a laboratory breakthrough into a global security threat.

For decades, U.S. biosecurity strategy has been built on prevention. Many DNA synthesis companies screen orders to make sure customers aren’t printing genomes of known pathogens. Labs follow safety protocols. Export controls slow the spread of sensitive technologies. These guardrails still matter. But they cannot keep up with the pace and power of AI innovation. Screening systems cannot flag a virus that has never existed before. And no border can block the diffusion of algorithms once they are published online.

First, the United States needs to build the computational tools required to respond as fast as new threats appear. The same models that design viruses can be trained to quickly design antibodies, antivirals and vaccines. But these models need data — on how immune systems and therapeutics interact with pathogens, on which designs fail in practice and on what manufacturing bottlenecks exist. Much of that information is siloed in private labs, locked up in proprietary datasets or missing entirely. The federal government should make building these high-quality datasets a priority.

Second, we need the physical capacity to turn those computer designs into real medicines. Right now, moving from a promising design to a working drug can take years. What’s needed are facilities on standby that can validate thousands of candidates in parallel, then quickly mass-produce the best ones. The private sector cannot justify the expense of building that capacity for emergencies that may never arrive. Government has to step in, taking the lead with long-term contracts that keep plants ready until the next crisis hits.

Third, regulation must adapt. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency-use pathways were not built for therapies designed by computers in real time. Needed are new fast-tracking authorities that allow provisional deployment of AI-generated countermeasures and clinical trials, coupled with rigorous monitoring and safety measures. And the entire system has to be stress-tested ahead of a crisis, with regular national exercises that simulate an AI-generated outbreak.

For years, experts have warned that generative biology could collapse the timeline between design and disaster. That moment has arrived. The viruses created in the Stanford experiment were harmless to humans. The next ones might not be.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758837734.0,California case suggests Tamiflu may save cats infected with H5N1 bird flu,"Since the avian flu arrived en force in California’s dairy industry in 2024, not only has it sickened cows, it has killed hundreds of domestic cats. Some pet cats that live on dairy farms were infected with the H5N1 virus by drinking raw milk. Both pets and feral barn cats got sick after eating raw pet food that harbored the virus. Still others got it by eating infected wild birds, rats or mice, or from contact with dairy workers’ contaminated clothes or boots.

But a new published case suggests that death may be averted if infected cats are treated early with antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu, or oseltamivir. Once treated, these animals may carry antibodies to the virus that makes them resistant to reinfection, at least temporarily.

The discovery was made by Jake Gomez, a veterinarian who treats small animals, such as cats and dogs, as well as large ones, including dairy cows, from his clinic, Cross Street Small Animal Veterinary Hospital, in Tulare.

Last fall, Gomez worked with a team of scientists from the University of Maryland and University of Texas who were in the Central Valley collecting blood samples from outdoor cats at dairy farms, looking to see if they could find antibodies to the H5N1 flu.

Cats are exquisitely sensitive to H5N1; one of the telltale signs that a dairy herd is infected is the presence of dead barn cats.

On Oct. 31, a cat owner brought in an indoor/outdoor cat to Gomez’ clinic that was ADR — a technical veterinarian acronym that stands for “ain’t doing right.”

The cat was up-to-date on all its vaccinations and the owner reported no known exposure to toxic chemicals.

Gomez offered to do blood work and urinalysis to probe more deeply what was going on, but the owner declined. So, Gomez sent them home with an antibiotic and an appetite stimulant. Two days later, the cat died.

It turned out the family had had another cat die just a few days earlier, Gomez said, recalling the visit.

Also during that time, Gomez was treating infected dairy herds around Tulare. Thousands of cows were falling sick from the virus. The family with the sick cats, he learned, lived less than a mile from an infected dairy, and the cat owner worked delivering hay to local dairies, spending time on infected farms.

“Considering how quickly it moved from one cat to the next, it occurred to me it might be H5N1,” he said.

Gomez said he reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and Agriculture to see if they would test the dead animals for the virus. The agencies, he said, gave him the runaround and he couldn’t get anyone to answer his calls — which he said was perplexing, considering the rapid response when he alerted them to infected cattle.

“If I called to tell them a dairy herd had it, within 24 hours a SWAT team from the USDA and state would be swarming the farm,” he said. But for a cat? Crickets.

On Nov. 6 and 7, the family returned with two more sick cats.

Gomez said he still didn’t know what they had, but had a suspicion they could be infected with H5N1. So, he treated them with the antiviral oseltamivir, known also as Tamiflu, and they recovered.

In March this year, blood samples collected from the two cats showed high levels of antibodies to H5N1 — suggesting the cats had been exposed.

The case was published in the journal One Health.

Kristen Coleman, an airborne infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, and an author on the paper, said the findings suggest that cats may be effectively treated and that antiviral medications could help prevent further spread of the virus among cats living in the same home and the humans who care for them.

She said there have been no known transmissions from cats to humans in this outbreak, but there have in the past — in 2005, Thai zookeepers were infected by tigers that had the virus, and in 2016, New York veterinarians at an animal shelter got it from tending to sick cats.

But Jane Sykes, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, said she’s not convinced the cats in this case actually had H5N1 — and urged people to read the study with care and caution.

“It’s possible that the positive antibody test results were unrelated to the reasons why those two cats died,” she said. “The virus wasn’t detected in any of the four cats, so infection was not proven.”

And whether the cats recovered because they were treated with Tamiflu, or whether the medication was incidental and they’d have recovered on their own — from another virus, infection or ailment — isn’t clear.

In addition, she said, no one has researched the effects of Tamiflu on cats. And while these two cats appeared to tolerate the drug, that doesn’t mean other cats will.

“Cats metabolize some of the anti-infective compounds very differently than other animals, including people, and they’re quite susceptible to bad side effects of many of these drugs,” she said. “We have to be really careful when we start just using random antiviral drugs that haven’t been studied for safety in cats, because they are so likely to get bad side effects.”

Having said that, she said if she were faced with a similar situation, a high certainty that a cat had been exposed, whether from drinking raw milk or eating raw food that had been infected, she would consider prescribing the medication. But she’d caution her client that it was experimental, and the animal could die from the drug. [...]

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) today announced that highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu has been detected in commercial poultry in Jefferson County, in the southeast, east of Madison. The agency is working with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on a joint incident response and said the birds will be culled. It added that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Jefferson County Public Health are monitoring exposed farm workers. The DATCP's poultry outbreak page says the Jefferson County farm has more than 3 million birds and the outbreak is the state's first since April. The finding is part of a recent rise in poultry outbreaks in a handful of Midwestern states.

The New Mexico Department of Health yesterday reported its second plague case of the year, which involves a 77-year-old man from Bernalillo County, home to Albuquerque. The man was hospitalized and has now been discharged. The state said it averages about two plague infections a year. The disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is spread by rodents, which can transmit the bacteria to humans through infected fleas. Symptoms in people include sudden fever onset, chills, headache, weakness, and often swollen, painful lymph nodes.

First declared on September 4, the outbreak is still confined to the Bulape Health Zone in Kasai Province. Of the 57 cases, 47 were confirmed, and 10 were probable; of the 35 deaths, 25 were confirmed, and 10 were probable. Five of the confirmed cases were diagnosed in healthcare workers.

Ebola, which spreads through infected blood and other body fluids, typically causes fever and weakness, followed by diarrhea and vomiting.

**Children account for 23% of all infections**

Infected patients range in age from 0 to 65 years, with those 0 to 9 years making up 23% of all cases. While females account for most cases (61%), their death rate is lower than that of males (56% vs 73%).

""The outbreak shows a decreasing trend of cases in the recent week, nevertheless the attention remains high, and response activities are ongoing in all affected health areas including early case detection, isolation, case management, contact tracing, vaccination as well as risk communication and community engagement,"" the WHO wrote. 

As of September 21, investigators have identified 1,180 contacts for follow-up. Of all contacts, 94 completed 21 days of monitoring, while the rest are still being tracked. Of 26 patients admitted to the Ebola Treatment Centre since the outbreak began, 2 recovered and were released on September 16, 5 died, and 19 are still being treated.

In total, 1,740 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the Bulape, Bulambae, and Mweka Health Zones in the 9 days since the campaign began.

""No international traffic-related measures are currently warranted,"" the statement said. Health authorities are reinforcing surveillance at border crossings through activities such as health screening, risk communication, and the integration of border communities in affected areas into early warning systems and the national surveillance network, it added.",1npphzd,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/ebola-outbreak-dr-congo-adds-11-new-cases-past-week,75

All infections were in children younger than 15 years, and children from the Somali community were especially hit hard in the early stages of the outbreak. 

Today a repeated cross-sectional study in JAMA Network Open shows that, at 12 and 20 months after the outbreak began, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage remained well below the 93% herd immunity threshold in central Ohio, suggesting that news of the outbreak and awareness of measles did not trigger a significant uptake of MMR vaccine. 

The study was based on 149,092 children seen at a large primary care network that served most of the central Ohio region. The authors used electronic medical records (EMRs) to assess MMR vaccination coverage over time, including timely receipt of first-dose (MMR1) and second-dose (MMR2) vaccine during the outbreak onset (October 8, 2022), 12 months later (October 8, 2023), and 20 months later (June 8, 2024).

The study included all children in the network who were 15 years and younger and had at least one well-child visits in the 2 years prior to the measles outbreak. The cohort was 8.6% of Somali descent and 91.4% of non-Somali descent. [...]

**CDC confirms 23 more US measles cases as 2025 total tops 1,500**

In its weekly measles update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there are now 1,514 confirmed measles cases in the United States reported this year, with 23 new cases reported in the past week. 

Eighty-six percent of the cases have been part of 40 outbreaks reported to the CDC. Of note, 92% of case-patients are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, 4% have only one measles, mumps, and rubella dose, and 4% were fully vaccinated. 

Twelve percent of cases have required hospitalization, with 29% of those hospitalized aged 19 years or younger. There have been 3 confirmed measles deaths this year. 

Georgia's health department reported three more measles infections with links to its most recent case; two patients were unvaccinated and one had an unknown vaccination status. Georgia now has 10 confirmed cases in 2025. In 2024, Georgia officials reported six cases.

Finally, as many as 11 babies exposed to measles in Utah were given postexposure prophylaxis (prevention) after four cases were identified in the Bear River Health Department's jurisdiction.

The infants under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated, were administered an immunoglobulin that provides short-term immunity.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758721704.0,The Misplaced Nostalgia for a Pre-Vaccine Past,"The way we respond to the disappointments, dangers, and defects of the present helps determine our political affiliations. If you think the answers lie somewhere in a future condition we’ve yet to achieve, then you may be persuaded by progressive politics; if you think the resources for rescuing society lie somewhere in the past, you may be attracted to conservative politics.

This general pattern helps explain the recent alignment of conservative politics and the anti-vaccine movement, despite its long-standing association with crunchy, left-ish causes. Today, the two tendencies have joined in mutual agreement about the wholesomeness of natural health versus modern medicine, indulging in nostalgia for a world before the widespread use of vaccines.

The past does contain its share of treasures, and it can be hard to accept that a world so rife with pain and despair is in certain ways the best it has ever been. But the idea that the past held a secret to health and happiness that we’ve lost somehow—especially with respect to infectious disease—is a fantasy with potentially lethal ramifications. [...] 

“Today’s children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant, between maternity and 18 years,” Kennedy said during a recent Senate hearing about Trump’s 2026 health-care agenda, by way of comparison with children of the past, who were required to receive fewer vaccines (if any at all). Likewise, Kennedy has rejected the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, a practice initiated in the mid-1940s to help prevent tooth decay, as well as the pasteurization of milk, which began in the late 19th century. “When I was a kid” in the ’50s and ’60s, Kennedy said earlier this year, “we were the healthiest, most robust people in the world. And today we’re the sickest.”

This is in some respects true, but in other ways dangerously wrong. Kennedy is quick to point out the relative rarity of chronic conditions such as childhood diabetes and autoimmune disorders in the past. But he is apparently hesitant to acknowledge that mid-century America came with its own share of serious health problems, including a high rate of cigarette smoking and horrifying infant mortality rates compared with the present. When Kennedy was young, vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses such as measles routinely killed hundreds annually. So far this year, only three people in the United States have died of measles—largely the result of an outbreak of the disease caused in part by declining vaccination rates. And if modern innovations in food and medicine have come with their share of hazards, it would be wrong to conclude that their predecessors were superior. Raw milk allegedly caused the hospitalization of a toddler and the miscarriage of an unborn child as recently as this summer.

At the center of the “Make America Healthy Again” crusade is a high degree of trust in the wisdom of nature. But the contemporary appeal of unadulterated nature springs from human successes in controlling the elements; it’s hard to romanticize a relatively recent vaccine-free past while considering photographs of children’s bodies ravaged by smallpox, a disease that persisted well into the 20th century. Likewise, long before COVID-19, America experienced cholera and flu pandemics with hundreds of thousands of associated deaths, as well as lesser outbreaks of illnesses such as diphtheria, polio, and pertussis, all three of which were notorious child-killers. Today, the rarity of those conditions has fostered a false sense of security, and a naive assessment of the natural world. Relinquishing the successes of general vaccine coverage, however, is guaranteed to belie the idea that untainted nature contains all the keys to health and wellness. Our historical moment has enough strife without revisiting past battles fought and won.

Queensland has the lowest immunisation coverage for one-year-olds of any state or territory, sitting at 90.35 per cent, which is below the target of 95 per cent.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758323238.0,CDC advisers weaken COVID vaccine recommendations but stop short of requiring prescriptions,"After at times contentious discussions over the science behind COVID vaccine and suspicions over its impacts, the vaccine advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today in a four-part vote fine-tuned its COVID vaccine recommendations and narrowly rejected its working group’s proposal to require a doctor’s prescription for the vaccine.

The main measure that would have added barriers to vaccination was a proposal that would have advised states and localities to require a doctor’s prescription for COVID vaccine for all groups, which in the initial vote was a 6-to-6 tie, with Martin Kulldorff, PhD, chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), breaking the tie with his no vote. Kulldorff is a statistician and epidemiologist formerly at Harvard University.

The unexpected result came after 2 days of choppy and sometimes chaotic proceedings that saw the group earlier today reverse one of its votes on the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine and postpone another on the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Liaison members, and even some ACIP members, at times voiced sharp concerns about the lack and quality of evidence backing the proposals, while raising questions about transparency and why ACIP was even weighing the topics.

Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota and leader of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said the proceedings shined a spotlight on the replacement of our nation’s evidence-based system that helped create access to lifesaving vaccines by an ideology-based system determined to limit access

Despite the pledge to not take away vaccines, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, did that through ACIP’s decision yesterday to limit access to the MMRV vaccine and continues to work to limit access to approved COVID vaccines, he said.

“Over and over, during the often-disorganized proceedings, CDC experts presented peer-reviewed vaccine data to members of the committee, only to have them dismiss, misunderstand, or mischaracterize the information or introduce their own unvetted and unpublished data,” Osterholm said. “Committee members also often seemed to lack understanding of the laws and regulations that govern vaccine administration and healthcare delivery in the US.”

**Weighing potential barriers to vaccination**

Most of the members who voted against the main measure worried that a prescription would be a barrier to immunization, especially for people who don’t have regular doctors and those in underserved areas, many of whom they said are in the groups at higher risk for severe COVID illness. They also aired concerns about adding an extra burden to already busy doctor’s offices. Those who voted for the measure, however, said the doctor’s prescription was needed to ensure that patients are adequately informed of the risks and benefits of vaccination.

The three other measures were less controversial. In one other vote, the group weighed in on adult and pediatric immunization schedules. They decided that adults age 65 and older should be vaccinated based on their own assessment and emphasized that, for people ages 6 months to 64 years old, the vaccination benefit is most favorable for those with underlying health conditions.

In two other separate votes, the group recommend that the CDC add more language about risks and uncertainties, including to vaccine information statements, and that healthcare providers talk to patients about risks and benefits of vaccination and known risk factors regarding COVID.

The latest meeting of ACIP, now hand-picked by Kennedy, comes amid the rollout of updated COVID vaccines ahead of the respiratory virus season and, for now, avoids adding more confusion on top of recent narrowed indications and recommendations from the CDC.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758239671.0,New CDC advisers scale back recommendations on MMRV vaccine in young kids,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory group today changed its recommendations for the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for the youngest children, continuing efforts by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to shake up childhood vaccine policies and schedules.

Varicella is also known as chickenpox. A scheduled vote on use of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth was tabled until tomorrow.

Skepticism of childhood vaccines, along with the numbers of them that American children receive, has been one of Kennedy’s main issues over many decades. And since his confirmation as HHS secretary in February he has taken steps to challenge established guidelines, partly through his hand-picked 12-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) panel, many of whom share his views. 

Without evidence, he has unilaterally changed the CDC’s COVID recommendations for children and other groups and has signaled sweeping changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, a point that was underscored yesterday at a hearing before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor & Pensions) Committee to probe the recent firing of CDC director Susan Monarez, PhD. She told lawmakers she was fired after refusing to pre-approve ACIP recommendations, regardless of scientific evidence.

When asked about the potential fallout from the Kennedy-led vaccine changes, Monarez told senators yesterday that she worried that diseases like measles, polio, diphtheria, and whooping cough will return. ""I believe our children will be harmed by things they do not need to be harmed by,"" she said.

In an opening statement, ACIP Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, a statistician and epidemiologist formerly at Harvard University, lashed out at recent critics of the vaccine panel and federal policy changes. He singled out a group of former CDC directors who published an editorial 2 weeks ago that raised concerns about Kennedy’s recent vaccine policies and related staff upheaval at the CDC as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), one of the groups that has issued its own vaccine recommendations and as one of several ex officio members is boycotting the ACIP meetings.

“With such debates, you can weigh and determine the scientific reasoning by each side, but without it, you cannot properly judge their arguments,” he said.

The new developments come as states and medical organizations depart from CDC recommendations and as the nation’s biggest insurance company trade group has signaled that it, at least for COVID and flu vaccines, will continue to provide coverage based on the recommendations of top medical organization. 

On the MMRV vote, the committee removed a long-standing ACIP recommendation, which stated that separate measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccination be used for children 12 to 47 months old, but that parents have the option of the MMRV vaccine for that age-group. Eight ACIP members voted to stop recommending the MMRV for children before the age of 4 years, while three voted against the measure and one member abstained. 

The group, however, did vote to maintain coverage for the MMRV vaccine through the Vaccines for Children program.

The MMRV vaccine was licensed in 2005 and is designed to streamline vaccine administration and boost overall vaccine uptake. The first dose of the live-attenuated vaccine is usually given from 12 to 15 months of age, with the second dose given from 4 to 6 years of age. The vaccine carries a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures when given as the first dose compared with separate MMR and varicella vaccines, especially among younger children.

Currently, only 15% of parents opt for the combined vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 months.

ACIP last discussed the MMRV vaccine in 2009, reviewing efficacy and safety data and affirming that the MMRV vaccine could deliver the two recommended doses required for protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. That recommendation emphasized that doctors should talk to parents to weigh the small seizure risk with the potential benefits of giving the two vaccines at once.[...]

The latest figures show the casualty rate has nearly doubled since last week — from 16 — and that the disease is spreading rapidly as more than 900 contacts have been identified so far, according to the WHO. Vaccinations began in the affected region on Sunday.

“More than 500 health care workers and contacts have received their vaccination, offering them crucial protection,” said Dr. Patrick Otim, an official at WHO Africa’s program.

A fresh Ebola outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 5 in the locality of Bulape in Kasai, a south-central region in Congo close to Angola.

Last week, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the disease had spread from two districts to four.

An additional batch of vaccines approved by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision will start arriving from Friday through Sunday, according to Sheillah Nsasiirwe, Health Emergency Officer for Immunization at WHO Africa.

“The vaccination has not been implemented as fast as we would have desired it to because of accessibility challenges which have caused delays in transporting the vaccines,” she said. WHO officials said they have been transporting the vaccines in small batches due to a lack of storage infrastructure in Bulape.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758225579.0,WHO reports four fatal Nipah virus infections in Bangladesh,"Four people from four geographically distinct areas of Bangladesh have died of Nipah virus infections this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced today.

The unrelated cases, which occurred between January 1 and August 29, include a child who died in August, outside of the country's usual Nipah virus season (December to April), and three adults (two men and one woman) with a history of consuming raw palm sap, a known risk. The child, a boy, wasn't known to have consumed raw palm sap, and his exposure is under investigation. 

The deaths occurred in Barisal, Dhaka, and Rajshahi divisions in the Bhola, Faridpur, and Pabna districts, respectively. Last year, five fatal Nipah cases were reported in the country.

**Risk of international spread low**

Since Bangladesh experienced its first Nipah virus outbreak in 2001, human cases have been identified nearly every year, the WHO said. Of the 347 people with documented infections since 2001, 71.7% have died. 

""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has implemented several public health measures with support from WHO,"" the statement said. ""WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by NiV [Nipah virus] at the national and regional levels to be moderate; the risk of international disease spread is considered low.""

No drugs or vaccines against the virus are available, and treatment of severe respiratory and neurologic complications consists of intensive supportive care.

Nipah is transmitted from animals such as fruit bats and pigs to people, from person to person through close contact, and through food contaminated with the saliva, urine, and waste of infected animals. Nipah virus infection, which can cause severe illness and death in both people and animals, primarily causes outbreaks in South and South East Asia.

Infected people initially develop symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and a sore throat. In severe cases, dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurologic signs can occur, indicating acute encephalitis (brain inflammation). Atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems sometimes develop, and encephalitis, seizures, and coma may ensue within 24 to 48 hours.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758156169.0,The Outbreaks That Could Rise on College Campuses,"In 2022, Florida weathered a bad outbreak of meningococcal disease, a type of fast-moving bacterial infection that can become fatal after entering the bloodstream or the lining of the brain and spinal cord. As the number of ill people climbed into the dozens, public-health officials scrambled to address clusters of cases, including one among college and university students. 

Campuses are primed for outbreaks: The bacteria spread through the kind of intimate or prolonged contact that’s rampant on campuses, where people are “kissing and sharing drinks, being in close quarters in dorm rooms and parties,” Sarah Nosal, the president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. College attendance is considered its own risk factor for infection, and many states—including Florida—require the meningococcal vaccine for students living on campus.

Soon, though, Florida’s policy may change. Earlier this month, the state’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, announced his intention to end all vaccine mandates: “Every last one of them is wrong,” he said. Some vaccine rules—including the one applying to the meningococcal vaccine—are written into the state’s laws, but Ladapo has said his office will partner with Governor Ron DeSantis’s to push for necessary changes.

A canceled mandate alone may do little to change the risk of meningococcal outbreaks on Florida’s college campuses. The CDC still recommends these vaccines for preteens and teenagers, and currently almost all American kids in that age group get at least one dose. But Florida’s rebellion against vaccine mandates is part of a larger erosion of the immunization status quo, as childhood-vaccination rates in the United States decline, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services chips away at long-standing vaccine policy, and more families seek exemptions from state requirements.

These changes won’t affect only young children, who are supposed to get numerous shots in their first 15 months of life. If vaccination rates fall—due to changing federal recommendations, states eliminating mandates, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment, or some combination of all of the above—middle schools, high schools, and college campuses may also become particular breeding grounds for once-controlled illnesses. [...] 

Meningococcal disease (which includes meningitis) is a very real concern for teenagers and young adults in a less vaccinated world. “You can be fine one minute and dead four hours later,” Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Thanks in no small part to vaccination, meningococcal disease is rare in the United States. But it’s been on the rise since 2021—last year’s count of 503 confirmed and probable cases was the highest recorded since 2013—and the ages of 16 to 23 are a risky time for contracting these infections, relatively speaking. The CDC currently recommends that kids get their first meningococcal vaccine at age 11 or 12, then another when they’re 16; only about 60 percent of kids in the U.S. get both doses by the time they’re 17. Even fewer get a separate vaccine that targets a meningococcal subtype responsible for many cases among teens and young adults. (The CDC does not routinely recommend this shot for teens without special risk factors for infection, instead leaving the choice up to patients and their doctors.)

In recent years, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the expert group that shapes the agency’s national vaccine recommendations, has considered dropping its recommendation for a first dose administered at age 11 or 12, since meningococcal infections are rare among preteens.

 Some experts have argued that axing that dose could set off a dangerous domino effect. Sarah Schaffer DeRoo, a primary-care pediatrician with Children’s National Hospital who has studied meningococcal disease and vaccination among college students, told me she worries that any disruption to established recommendations could cause confusion and contribute to further drops in vaccination rates, and more unvaccinated students means more chances for these infections to take root.

[...] 

If the committee continues to wind back vaccine recommendations, adolescents and teens could also be affected by vaccination decisions made on behalf of much younger people, Walter Orenstein, who formerly ran the United States Immunization Program, told me. Herd immunity only holds when protection is so high throughout an entire population that contagious illnesses are virtually unable to spread. If childhood-vaccination rates plummet, giving pathogens new targets in unprotected babies and young children, outbreaks won’t necessarily stay contained to those age groups. People of all ages—particularly those who are immunocompromised or under-vaccinated, but also some who are just plain unlucky—are bound to get sick too.

“If we stopped all vaccinations today, we won’t have huge outbreaks tomorrow,” Orenstein said. It would take time for the susceptible population to grow. But over time, largely forgotten illnesses could reestablish a foothold. If measles-mumps-rubella vaccination declined by 10 percent, for instance, the U.S. could see more than 11 million measles cases over the next 25 years, according to a 2025 modeling study. (Even at current vaccination rates, the disease may again become endemic and result in about 850,000 cases over the next 25 years, the study projected.)

Older kids and young adults would not be spared. Despite measles’ reputation as a childhood disease, about one-third of the cases recorded in the U.S. so far this year were among people 20 and older. And at least 8 percent of people sickened by measles this year had gotten one or more doses of the MMR vaccine—living proof that vaccinated people are also at risk when illnesses are given room to maneuver.

“This is what I call the new epidemiology of measles,” Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me. The fact that adults are already catching measles suggests outbreaks could easily emerge in high schools and on college campuses, particularly if vaccine coverage wanes—the last thing any school wants, given the disease’s extreme contagiousness.

Mumps is another concern, Offit added. It spreads best among people in close contact, such as students. Immunity can also wane over time, even among people who get vaccinated, which raises the chance of campus clusters. Across the board, if vaccination rates fall, “we’re going to be spending a lot more time dealing with outbreaks,” Osterholm predicted. “We’re going to have an increasing number of cases and, unfortunately, an increasing number of deaths among kids” of all ages.

To forgo vaccinations proven to prevent deadly and debilitating diseases is to accept the possibility of these grim outcomes—which parents haven’t had to think about for decades, as mass immunization has invisibly done its job. “That is the choice we’re making,” Nosal said. “We just don’t completely understand that choice because we haven’t seen it.” At least not yet.

Monarez said she could not approve recommendations from ACIP without reviewing evidence and had no basis to fire the scientific experts at the CDC.

""I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity, but that line does not disappear with me,"" she said.

[...] 

Monarez continued in her opening statement that she agrees with President Trump that ""we should not hesitate to ask for proof about our vaccines.""

""I also agree with his most recent comments that vaccines are not controversial because they work,"" she added. ""Demanding evidence is exactly what I was doing when I insisted CDC recommendations be based on credible science.""

She said she was ""never misaligned with the administration priorities"" or goals of Kennedy.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1758030427.0,Kennedy's vaccine panel expected to recommend delaying hepatitis B shot in children,"A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying, until age 4, the hepatitis B vaccine that's currently given to newborns, according to two former senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,"" said Demetre Daskalakis, the former director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ""Apparently this is a priority of the Secretary's.""

The vote is expected to take place Thursday during the next meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The meeting is scheduled for September 18-19 at a CDC office in Atlanta, Georgia.

For more than 30 years, the CDC has advised that infants get the first of three shots of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Between 1990 and 2022, case rates plummeted 99 percent among people age 19 and younger.

Pediatricians warn that waiting until age 4 to begin vaccination opens the door to more children contracting the virus.

""Age four makes zero sense,"" said pediatrician Eric Ball, who practices in Orange County, California. ""We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It's really the best way to keep our entire population healthy. 

In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine, and COVID vaccines.

Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, because ACIP's recommendations generally determine whether insurance plans and federal programs pay for the vaccines.

Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.

[...] 

In an email, a Health and Human Services spokesman, Andrew Nixon, wrote, ""ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.""

The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public Sunday, only a few days before the meetings are scheduled to begin.

[...] 

The prospect of altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.

""I am goddamn frustrated,"" said Wendy Lo, 52, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. Lo says she has probably had hepatitis B since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has impacted almost every aspect of her life.

""I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,"" she said.

Lo only learned she had the disease due to a routine screening in order to study abroad in college as a young adult.

Lo credits the vaccines with protecting all the members of her close family from infection.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757972725.0,RFK Jr. appoints five more members to vaccine panel,"
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday added five members to serve on his handpicked vaccine advisory panel just days ahead of a key meeting where the group will make recommendations for who should get COVID shots.

Why it matters: Some of the new members were critical of the pandemic response or faced charges of spreading misinformation.

Last month's firing of Centers for Disease Control director Susan Monarez, along with the resignations of several top agency scientists and appointment of some outside experts with known anti-vaccine views, left few guardrails on Kennedy's agenda.

The new members are:

Kirk Milhoan, pediatric cardiologist and former U.S. Air Force flight surgeon based in Hawai'i, who was accused — and then cleared by the state medical board — of spreading COVID-19 misinformation.

Catherine Stein, a professor and epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, who criticized the state's models for crafting its policy response to COVID as ""cloaked in secrecy"" in a testimonial to state lawmakers in 2020.

Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist and director of medication access and affordability at AscensionRx in Missouri, per LinkedIn.

Evelyn Griffin, an OB-GYN in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Raymond Pollak, a surgeon and transplant specialist.
How it works: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices serves as an expert source to make recommendations to the CDC. 

While the CDC director still has final say, its recommendations can influence whether insurers cover vaccines.

The panel is due to meet Sept. 18 and 19 to discuss COVID boosters the FDA approved for at-risk populations, as well as new recommendations on the MMR and Hepatitis B vaccines.

Kennedy dismissed all 17 members of ACIP in June, bringing on eight new members. One of those individuals later stepped down.

Committee members typically are experts in immunology or epidemiology, carefully vetted for conflicts and serve full terms across presidential administrations.

The Washington Post reported on Friday that officials plan to link COVID-19 vaccine to deaths of 25 children as they consider limiting which Americans should get the shots. The finding appears to come from a federal safety database that isn't designed to assess causality, per the Post.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757894299.0,Ebola vaccination begins in southern Congo amid latest outbreak,"LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — Vaccination for those exposed to the Ebola virus and front-line health workers has begun in southern Kasai province, the World Health Organization said Sunday.

An outbreak of the highly contagious disease was announced earlier this month in the locality of Bulape, in Kasai, and has left at least 16 dead and 68 suspected cases, according to last week’s briefing by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Only an initial 400 doses of the Ervebo vaccine have been dispatched, with the rest to be delivered later, the WHO said. The operation has been hampered by limited access and scarce funds.

The vaccination is expected to pick up later as the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision approved roughly 45,000 additional vaccines, the WHO said, adding to an initial stockpile of 2,000 doses was already in the country.

The latest Ebola outbreak is Congo’s 16th since 1976, and it is caused by the Zaire species, named after the country’s former name. It adds another layer of worry for the central African country that is battling a multi-pronged conflict with rebel groups, especially in the eastern region of the country, where violence has decimated the health system.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757708964.0,FDA to present data it claims ties Covid shots to child deaths at CDC meeting,"Food and Drug Administration officials plan to present data they claim links the Covid vaccine to 25 deaths in children at what’s expected to be a closely watched vaccine advisory committee next week, a source confirmed to NBC News.

The Washington Post first reported the expected data.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review and make recommendations on several vaccines, including this fall’s updated Covid shots.

The FDA is basing its claim on an analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a publicly available database maintained by the FDA and the CDC, according to three sources familiar with the plan.

But, two of the sources said, the agency is misusing the database which allows anyone — including doctors, patients and caregivers — to submit reports to VAERS about adverse events they believe are linked to vaccines. The reports are unverified, but the health agencies use the database as a guide for topics to investigate further.

Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco, said the database reports can't prove a connection between vaccination and children's deaths.

“To identify causation to a vaccine you need to show that the cause of death was something the vaccine caused, and by itself, a VAERS report would not show that — you need larger studies comparing incidents of the harm with or without the vaccine,” she said in an email.

In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process.”

Last week, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told CNN that the agency was looking into deaths of healthy children from the Covid shots.

“We’ve been looking into the VAERS database of self-reports that there have been children that have died from the Covid vaccine,” Makary said. “We’re going to release a report in the coming few weeks and we’re going to let people know. We’re doing an intense investigation.”

The VAERS website warns that reports can contain inaccurate, incomplete or biased information. ""As a result, there are limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind.""

The Washington Post reported that Makary’s special adviser Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a sports medicine physician who criticized Covid shots for children during the pandemic, is expected to present the new findings at next week’s vaccine committee meeting.

One former FDA official, who requested anonymity to speak freely, pushed back on the findings.

“I can tell you on a stack of Bibles that we looked through all of the autopsy reports and that we didn’t find anything,” the official said in a text message. “Unless someone was hiding them from us I don’t know what they’re referring to.” [...] 

Kennedy has already taken steps to limit access to this year’s vaccine: Last month, he announced that the FDA had approved updated Covid shots for the fall for people 65 and up and those with underlying medical conditions. The limited approval has left some patients and pharmacies confused, and some patients report that they haven’t been able to get the shots.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published last week, Makary said the approval brings the U.S. in line with peer nations, including France, which recommends Covid shots for people over 80, and the U.K., which recommends the shots for people over 75.

“The FDA can approve products only if we believe there is substantial certainty that the benefits outweigh the risks,” Makary wrote, questioning whether the benefits of a “seventh Covid shot” currently outweigh the risks for a “healthy 12-year-old girl who recently recovered from Covid.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757630527.0,Los Angeles child dies from rare measles complication years after recovery,"A school-age child in Los Angeles has died of a rare complication from measles, years after being infected with the virus.

The Los Angeles health department announced the death Thursday, part of a warning to residents about the importance of getting vaccinated.

The department said the child got measles as an infant before they were eligible for their first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot. The first dose should be given to babies at 12 to 15 months, followed by a second at 4 to 6 years.

The child recovered, but years later developed a rare, progressive brain disorder known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), the department said. The condition can occur in people who had measles early in life, usually around 2 to 10 years after the initial infection.

“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” Dr. Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County health officer, said in a news release.

“Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself — it’s about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated,” he said.

About 1 in 10,000 people with measles later develop SSPE — but among those who are infected as infants, the risk is around 1 in 600, according to the Los Angeles health department.

The condition affects the central nervous system, so people may experience seizures or lose the ability to walk before falling into a coma or vegetative state. There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disorder, and most patients die within one to three years of diagnosis.

Nationally, measles vaccination rates have dipped in recent years. Less than 93% of kindergartners in the United States received the recommended two doses during the 2023-24 school year (a rate of 95% is generally needed to curb the spread).[...] ",1nemvt2,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/los-angeles-child-dies-rare-measles-complication-years-after-recovery-rcna230675,936
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757523870.0,"'We have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic,' says leading epidemiologist Michael Osterholm","COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 7 million people across the world, to date, including over 1 million people in the U.S., according to the World Health Organization. In addition to this staggering death toll, the disease has unleashed a wave of chronic illness, and at the peak of the pandemic, it triggered widespread disruptions in supply chains and health care services that ultimately threatened or ended people's lives.

Since its emergence in 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has had a tremendous impact on society. And yet, the next pandemic could potentially be even worse.

That's the argument of a new book by Michael Osterholm, founding director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, and award-winning author Mark Olshaker. The text doesn't just serve as a warning. As suggested by its title — ""The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics"" (Little Brown Spark, 2025) — the book lays out lessons learned during past pandemics and points to actions that could be taken to mitigate harm and save lives when the next infectious disease outbreak tears across the globe.

Notably, the text was finalized before President Donald Trump began his second term.

Since then, ""we have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic,"" Osterholm told Live Science. ""The office that normally did this work in the White House has been totally disbanded.""

Live Science spoke with Osterholm about the new book, what we should expect from the next pandemic and how we might prepare — both under ideal circumstances and under the current realities facing the U.S.

**Nicoletta Lanese: Given the book's title — ""The Big One"" — I figured we could start by defining what you mean by that phrase.**

Michael Osterholm: Having worked, as I have, with coronaviruses, there are two characteristics that become very important: One is, how infectious are they? How relatively able are they to transmit? And [two], how lethal are they? How serious is the illness that they create, and the number of deaths?

I worked on both SARS and MERS before COVID came along. [SARS and MERS are severe coronavirus infections that predate COVID-19.] Those were two viruses that basically had the ability to kill 15% to 35% of the people that it infected, but they weren't nearly as infectious because they didn't have the ACE receptor capacity. [SARS-CoV-2, in comparison, plugs into the ACE2 receptor on human cells.]

But then along comes COVID, which basically has this highly infectious characteristic but fortunately, the case-fatality rate and serious illness was substantially lower than what we saw with MERS and SARS. **Just in the last six months, there's actually been the isolation of new coronaviruses from bats in China that actually have both [high infectiousness and high lethality] now. They actually have the ACE receptor capacity as well as that segment of the virus that was responsible for causing such severe illness.**

So imagine a next pandemic where it's as infectious as COVID was, but instead of killing 1% to 2% of the people [it infected], it killed 15% to 35% of the people. That's exactly the example we're talking about with The Big One.

The same thing is true with influenza. You know, we've not seen a really severe influenza pandemic dating back to 1918, relative to what it could be. And clearly there are influenza pandemics there, in a sense, waiting to happen. In the future, someday, that could easily be similar to or worse than what we saw with 1918 flu.

So we're trying to give people a sense that nobody's dismissing how severe COVID was, or what it did. It was devastating. But devastating with a ""small d,"" not a ""capital D,"" when you compare it to what could happen.

**NL: You mentioned both coronaviruses and influenza. Do you think the pathogen that sparks the next pandemic will belong to one of those groups?**

MO: We refer to these as ""viruses with wings"" in our book — you have to have a ""virus with wings"" to really make it into the pandemic category. I don't think there's a bacteria right now that would fit that characteristic; it really is in the virus family.

The greatest likelihood is going to be an influenza [virus] or coronavirus. Sure, there could be a surprise infection that comes up, but it'll have to have characteristics like flu and coronavirus in the sense of respiratory transmission. [...] 

**NL: And when you talk about mitigating pandemics, you make the point that governments must be involved, that industry can't do it alone. Why?**

MO: Let me just say: I regret we didn't have six more months on this book. So many things have changed even from the time that the last manuscript went in at the end of last year and now, just because of what's happened in the Trump administration. We have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic. The office that normally did this work in the White House has been totally disbanded [that being the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy]. And there's no expertise there.

Today, if we had a major influenza pandemic and we needed vaccine, we'd be using the embryonated chicken egg, which is the only means we have for any large-volume production of vaccine. Novavax has a cell-based one, but it's very limited how much can be produced. Even with all the global capacity, we could only make enough vaccine in the first 12 to 18 months for about one-fourth of the world. So three-quarters of the world in the first year of the pandemic wouldn't even see a vaccine, and it would take several years more.

Well, mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House. HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] said no more, $500 million is down. The money had been given to Moderna to actually develop prototypes ready to go so that if we needed them, we wouldn't have to go through the long laborious process of getting them approved. We get them approved now with the strain change issue [left for when a pandemic virus emerges].

And suddenly, that is like losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet [9,100 meters] — it's a devastating situation. [...]

Kinshasa, September 10, 2025 (ACP).- Sixty-eight (68) cumulative cases of Ebola virus disease, including 15 deaths, have been recorded up to September 8, 2025 in the Bulape health zone, in Kasai, central Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a press release from the National Institute of Public Health received by the ACP on Wednesday.

"" The Bulape health zone, in the Mweka territory, has recorded since the official declaration of the epidemic until September 8, 68 cumulative cases and 15 deaths, representing a lethality rate of 22%,"" the statement read.

According to the source, patients are being treated free of charge at the Bulape Ebola treatment center.

The response is coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health (INSP), through its Public Health Emergency Operations Center (COUSP), under the authority of Dr. Dieudonné Mwamba, with the support of the Congolese government's technical and financial partners.

The statement noted that the main actions underway are the delivery of vaccine doses from Kinshasa to Bulape. Community awareness-raising on preventive measures, namely: avoiding contact with the body of a person who has died of Ebola, washing hands regularly with soap and water, not touching objects soiled by a sick or deceased person, and getting vaccinated against Ebola.

The source also cited the organization of dignified and secure burials (EDS), the protection and training of healthcare personnel as well as reinforced surveillance and contact tracing, among the main actions underway.

The installation of an INRB mobile mini-laboratory in Bulape and the validation of the national response plan by the Minister of Health and partners are also among these actions.

This is the 16th episode of Ebola resurgence in the DRC. Accessibility to intervention areas remains a major challenge due to the critical condition of the roads, which slows the delivery of supplies and the deployment of personnel.

Health authorities, through the INSP, are reminding everyone that prevention is the most effective weapon against Ebola and are calling on the population to rigorously apply hygiene and protection measures in order to break the chain of transmission. ACP/UKB

The Utah High School Cycling League event, which was held at the Soldier Hollow Nordic Center on Aug. 16, had approximately 2,000 people in attendance. The DHHS said several people were infected.

League officials told FOX 13 News that this was a Region 6 event, comprised of teams from Utah County and southern Utah. They believe the cases were largely confined to one team from southern Utah, with fewer than 10 infected.

The Wasatch County Health Department said Tuesday that no local residents participated in the event that day, and they have not detected any measles cases in their county. They added that the incubation period for this particular event ended on Sept. 6.

The Wasatch County School District also said they had no connection to the event.

Utah High School Cycling League director Chris Best said their subsequent events still went on as normal. The next Region 6 race happened in Cedar City on Aug. 30, and they will go again this Saturday in Manti.

But league officials have asked anyone who has measles symptoms or is unvaccinated to withdraw from their races. They're sharing guidance from the DHHS with the participants and their families. They also noted that Region 6 includes areas where some communities choose not to vaccinate.

Vermont health officials have confirmed that the first human case of Jamestown Canyon virus due to a mosquito bite.

Officials with the Vermont Department of Health said they confirmed that a person in Windsor County has contracted Jamestown Canyon virus, which can cause flu-like symptoms in some people.

Laboratory testing confirmed the diagnosis on Monday, Sept. 8, along with reporting from the person's health care provider. The name of the person will not be released due to patient confidentiality laws.

While most people who are infected with Jamestown Canyon virus do not report feeling sick, some common symptoms include fever, fatigue, and headache, according to the health department. People with already compromised immune systems are particularly likely to develop severe symptoms, which can include confusion, loss of coordination, seizure and stiff neck, experts said.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Jamestown Canyon virus.

Borealpox virus (BRPV; formerly Alaskapox virus) is an orthopoxvirus (OPXV) first found in 2015 in a woman living near Fairbanks, in Alaska's interior. The infection was identified as a novel OPXV, but the source was unidentified.

Published yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases, the study involved patient or parent interviews, trapping 176 wild small mammals at six sites for OPXV testing, and phylogenetic analyses of viral DNA sequences to reconstruct their evolution.

Nearly all OPXVs are zoonotic viruses that infect mammals, with rodents often the primary animal reservoir. ""Human population immunity to OPXVs is waning globally after the eradication of smallpox, which is likely a reason why OPXVs are being identified with increasing frequency globally,"" the investigators wrote. 

Five of the infected patients had one or more lesions and lymph node swelling and later recovered, most after receiving antibiotics. The other patient, an older man with a weakened immune system, was hospitalized and died despite receiving experimental OPXV medications. 

One patient reported vaccination against smallpox, and all had contact with domestic animals, many of which hunted small mammals. One patient's dog tested positive for borealpox. 

No patients had traveled outside of Alaska, and no evidence of person-to-person spread was found. All BRPV genomes were nearly 100% identical to that of the virus isolated from the 2015 patient.

Several small-mammal species had BRPV DNA and evidence of past OPXV infection in their blood. Genetic distance and phylogenetic analyses pointed to multiple animal-to-human spillover events.

""Better understanding BRPV ecology might help develop more focused prevention measures in addition to standard recommendations to prevent zoonotic infections, such as practicing hand hygiene and avoiding contact with wild animals, including taking measures to keep small mammals out of buildings,"" the authors wrote.

Officials at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland led the investigation of 41 N meningitidis conjunctivitis cases, which are uncommon in adults with healthy immune systems, on the 11,800-trainee base from February to May. Eighty percent of patients reported a recent upper respiratory infection. The investigation also revealed 32 cases of Haemophilus conjunctivitis.

All trainees had received the quadrivalent (four-strain) meningococcal vaccine soon after arrival for basic training. N meningitidis is an unusual bacterial cause of conjunctivitis (pink eye), the authors noted.

""Bacterial conjunctivitis in adults involves direct inoculation into conjunctival membranes without entering the bloodstream or central nervous system,"" they wrote. ""The estimated N. meningitis nasopharyngeal carriage rate (including encapsulated and unencapsulated strains) is as high as 5%-10% in some U.S. populations, with a peak prevalence of 23.7% in adults aged 19 years.""

""Because the average age of a military trainee includes this age, colonization with N. meningitidis is expected to be high,"" they added.

Most patients' infections (85%) were in one eye. One patient was hospitalized and treated for periorbital cellulitis with intravenous antibiotics, while all other patients recovered after they were given topical antibiotics. Whole-genome sequencing of isolates from the first two patients suggested that the bacterium was unencapsulated, and the cases were related.

An investigation of trainee hygiene and cleaning practices determined that no protocols were broken, and no outbreak source was identified.

""When outbreaks of mucopurulent conjunctivitis occur in congregate living settings, culturing exudate can identify outbreak etiology, and whole genome sequencing can help guide treatment and response,"" the researchers wrote.

""Previous studies indicated that systemic antimicrobial therapy might be needed to prevent invasive infections of N. meningitidis cases; findings from this investigation suggest that nongroupable N. meningitidis conjunctivitis in otherwise healthy persons might be successfully treated with topical antimicrobials,"" they added.",1n9dxxj,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/report-describes-n-meningitidis-conjunctivitis-outbreak-us-military-base,53

“Amid ‘unprecedented’ rise in respiratory disease in Gaza, famine is making routine infections life-threatening. 

Local authorities in Gaza have identified a ""new strain"" of respiratory virus in Gaza amid worsening conditions of famine and severe malnutrition, which threaten to cause even routine infections to turn deadly.

At Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Manal Zaqout accompanies her 6-year-old daughter, Aya, for treatment. Aya had been moved to the hospital from the al-Mawasi areas east of Khan Younis after a continuous cough, fever, and fatigue that refused to resolve itself. The child was diagnosed with the flu, but the symptoms were far more severe than regular influenza. 

On Sunday, the Gaza Government Media Office said that a “new strain” of the virus is spreading across Gaza amid a severe shortage in medicines due to Israel’s blockade of humanitarian assistance to the Strip…..”

This is obviously concerning for many reasons, but in terms of the pathogen it seems unclear. Other stories say they don’t have testing capabilities so they aren’t sure if it’s flu, COVID, etc. It is apparently ravaging the starved and the weak.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757023518.0,Three states take steps to ensure COVID vaccine access,"Amid confusion in some states over whether pharmacies can provide COVID shots to residents before they are recommended by a federal vaccine advisory group, several states are taking steps to ensure access.

Among them is Pennsylvania, where the State Board of Pharmacy yesterday voted to allow pharmacists in the state to follow the vaccine recommendations of other ""trusted authorities,"" including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The vote came after Governor Josh Shapiro called on the board to ensure access to the updated vaccines, which received more restricted approvals from the FDA in late August. Although the FDA approved updated COVID shots for all people ages 65 and older, those below age 65 need to have at least one underlying condition identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that puts them at increased risk of severe illness.

**Confusion after CVS decision**

The confusion began after pharmacy chains such as CVS began receiving the updated vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax last week. Pennsylvania is one of 16 states that require all vaccines administered by pharmacists to be approved by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which will not vote on those recommendations until its next meeting on September 18. CVS officials said the vaccines would not be available in those states.

CVS subsequently said residents of Pennsylvania and 12 other states could obtain the updated COVID vaccines with a doctor's prescription. But critics say that requirement makes it more difficult to get the shots, and there have been reports that even those for whom the vaccines have been approved are being turned away. The vote by Pennsylvania's pharmacy board means residents will no longer need a prescription.

""The Trump Administration's outrageous decision to limit access to the COVID vaccine is an affront to Pennsylvanians' personal freedoms,"" Shapiro said in a news release. ""I called on the State Board of Pharmacy to hold a special meeting to bring clarity to the people of Pennsylvania.""

""Following today's regulatory action by the Pennsylvania Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our locations throughout Pennsylvania,"" said Sid Tenneti, MBA, of CVS Health.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1757011905.0,Researchers discover new bat-borne henipavirus: Salt Gully virus,"Scientists at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, have identified a new virus in Australian flying foxes, a discovery which strengthens Australia’s preparedness against emerging infectious diseases.

Named Salt Gully virus, the novel henipavirus was discovered in bat urine samples collected in Queensland.

CSIRO researchers were able to isolate and grow Salt Gully virus in CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) high containment laboratory.

Salt Gully virus belongs to the same virus family as Hendra virus, which has caused fatal infections in horses and humans in Australia, and Nipah virus, known for causing outbreaks in humans across Asia.

Jennifer Barr, experimental scientist at CSIRO’s ACDP, said henipaviruses are recognised by the World Health Organization as priority pathogens for research, and the discovery increases knowledge of this important virus group.

“Although Salt Gully virus is new to science, there’s no cause for public alarm,” Mrs Barr said.

“We’ve detected Salt Gully virus in bat samples dating back to 2011, which shows it’s been circulating in nature for over a decade without any evidence of it causing illness in animals or humans,” Mrs Barr said.

This discovery provides a foundation for further research into how the virus compares with Hendra and Nipah, including its potential to cause disease.

“Early findings show Salt Gully virus does not rely on the same cell receptors as Hendra or Nipah viruses, suggesting that the infection process will be different. As a result, we can’t predict whether it will result in future disease outbreaks in humans or animals,” Mrs Barr said.

By understanding these viruses, researchers can better prepare for potential outbreaks.  

“Now that we’ve identified the virus, diagnostic tests can be developed. This means if a spillover from bats and disease outbreak were to occur, we’d have the tools to detect this virus earlier – enabling timely measures to prevent further spread,"" Mrs Barr explained.

The existing Hendra vaccine for horses remains effective against Hendra virus disease, and Salt Gully virus does not compromise this protection. Its discovery does not change the current health risk posed by bats.  

ACDP is a vital part of Australia’s preparedness for disease outbreaks. Its microbiologically and physically secure facilities allow teams to work safely with animal and zoonotic diseases while keeping them securely contained.  

The research, published in the September issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, marks a significant step forward in understanding viruses that originate in wildlife and could pose a risk to livestock and human health.

(AP) — Florida will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates in the state, building on the effort by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to curb vaccine requirements and other health mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level “Make America Healthy Again” commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

On the vaccines, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo cast current requirements in schools and elsewhere as an “immoral” intrusion on people’s rights bordering on “slavery,” and hampers parents’ ability to make health decisions for their children.

The state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end “all of them. Every last one of them.”

Florida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.

Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who is running for Orlando mayor, said in a social media post that scrapping vaccines “is reckless and dangerous” and could cause outbreaks of preventable disease.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1756862716.0,"A common nasal spray may block Covid infection, trial results indicate","An over-the-counter nasal spray which has been used for years as a safe and effective treatment for seasonal allergies could potentially prevent Covid infections, according to clinical trial results released Tuesday.

The antihistamine azelastine works as an antiviral against a range of respiratory infections, including influenza, RSV and the virus that causes Covid, a growing number of studies have shown.

German scientists at Saarland University Hospital recruited 450 adults, mostly in their early 30s. The first group of 227 participants tested a puff of the nasal spray in each nostril, three times a day. The other 223 were instructed to do the same, but with a placebo spray.

All participants were given Covid rapid tests twice a week over the course of nearly two months. By the end, the incidence of Covid infections in the azelastine group was 2.2%, significantly lower than the 6.7% infection rate in the placebo group.

Azelastine also appeared to reduce rates of other symptomatic respiratory infections, in general, the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found.

The researchers said they were not entirely sure why azelastine appears to be effective at limiting Covid infections, but they suggested that it might bind to the virus in the nasal mucosa, the moist membrane lining the nose which pathogens must navigate to enter the body, and inhibits a key enzyme that it uses to replicate.

Another possibility is that azelastine interacts with the ACE2 receptor, the preferred entry point which the Covid virus uses to access human cells, and prevents it from latching on.

“Our findings suggest azelastine could serve as a scalable, over-the-counter prophylactic against Covid, especially when community transmission is elevated or in high-risk settings such as crowded indoor events or travelling,” said Dr. Robert Bals, professor of internal medicine and pneumology at Saarland University and the study’s senior author.

The trial had limitations, namely that the participants were all young and relatively healthy, he said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1756819061.0,Ancient DNA solves mystery behind world's first pandemic,"In an extraordinary breakthrough, scientists have traced the deadly bacterium behind the world’s earliest recorded pandemic to its epicentre for the first time.

The Justinian Plague, which devastated the eastern Mediterranean 1,500 years ago, has long been described in historical texts - but until now, the microbe responsible remained a mystery.

Researchers have identified traces of the Yersinia pestis bacterium in a mass grave beneath the ruins of Jerash in Jordan, providing the first direct biological evidence of the Plague of Justinian.

""For centuries, we've relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague's presence,"" said Rays HY Jiang, lead author of the study and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health.

""Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire"".

The Justinian Plague, which began in 541 CE, marks the world’s first recorded pandemic. Sweeping across the eastern Mediterranean and the Byzantine Empire, some historians believe it was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15 to 100 million people during two centuries of recurrence.

The mystery behind the plague has now been solved: researchers believe it was caused by Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium responsible for later outbreaks, including the Black Death in 1346.

The zoonotic bacterium spreads primarily via fleas that infest rodents, particularly rats living in close contact with humans, and can also be transmitted directly between people in its pneumonic form.

Using advanced DNA techniques, the new study, led by an interdisciplinary team at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, examined eight human teeth recovered from burial chambers beneath Jerash’s ancient Roman hippodrome.

The DNA revealed that the victims shared almost identical strains of Y pestis, confirming the bacterium’s presence in the empire between 550 and 660 AD. The findings suggest a swift, deadly outbreak, consistent with historical accounts of mass fatalities.

Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centres were very likely overwhelmed"".

A related study shows that Y pestis had circulated among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak. It also suggests that later pandemics - including the Black Death and sporadic cases today - did not emerge from a single source but arose independently from animal reservoirs.

""We've been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years and people still die from it today,"" Jiang said.

""Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can't get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away"".

For the week ending Aug. 9, the COVID hospitalization rate was 1.7 per 100,000, double the rate from two months ago, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Additionally, for the week ending Aug. 23, 11.2% of weekly tests came back positive for COVID, up from 3.3% the prior two months, CDC data shows.

Despite the increases, metrics remain much lower than in previous years.

Hospitalization rates are about three times lower than at the same time last year and the percentage of weekly tests coming pack positive is about two times lower compared to the same period last year.

Additionally, over the past two months, roughly 200 Americans have been dying from COVID every week, according to CDC data.

There has been confusion over who may be able to receive a COVID vaccine after the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of those shots for those over age 65 and younger Americans who are at high risk for severe disease. Federal health officials have insisted that anyone who wants the shot can receive it.

CDC data shows test positivity has increased above 10% in much of the southwest and western U.S. as kids head to class.

""When the dust settles, I expect it to not be as bad as last year … but that still means that some people are getting sick,"" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told ABC News. ""Fewer people are getting hospitalized, proportionately speaking, but some people are still being hospitalized.""

""The reason why we're seeing the increase is because of the usual factors of more than six months since a lot of people got COVID [and] new variants,"" he continued. 

As of the week ending August 30, XFG, an offshoot of the omicron variant, is the dominant variant in the U.S., accounting for an estimated 78% of new COVID cases.

Meanwhile, NB.1.8.1 and LP.8.1, also omicron variant offshoots, make up 14% and 3% of estimated new COVID cases in the U.S., CDC data shows.

The case involves a 4-year-old unvaccinated boy from Lae, Morobe Province, who developed acute flaccid paralysis.

This marks a pivotal moment in the country’s polio response, confirming that the virus has transitioned from environmental detection to direct impact on children.

To combat the spread, Papua New Guinea launched a nationwide Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) on 11 August 2025, targeting children under 10 years with the novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2). The campaign has been extended to 5 September to help provinces reach the critical 95% coverage target. As of 26 August, national coverage stands at 41.2%, with Hela Province leading at 91%.

A second round of SIA is scheduled from 29 September to 17 October, which will include both nOPV2 and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) to provide stronger and longer-lasting protection. Over 9 million doses of nOPV2 and 4 million doses of IPV have been secured, along with additional stocks of measles-rubella, pentavalent vaccines, Vitamin A, and deworming tablets. [...] 

To date, 122 cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) have been reported, with 93 tested and confirmed negative for cVDPV2—an important indicator of active surveillance. Efforts are being intensified to strengthen surveillance systems nationwide, with targeted support for provinces that have yet to report cases.

The National Department of Health, with support from WHO and partners, is working to improve stool sample adequacy—currently at 62.5%—through enhanced training, logistics, and active case finding. These measures are vital to ensuring timely detection and response, and to interrupting poliovirus transmission across all communities.

“Polio is preventable. The vaccines are safe, effective, and free,” said Dr. Sevil Huseynova, WHO Representative in PNG. “But we must act together—with urgency and unity. WHO stands ready to support every province, every health worker, and every community.”

Papua New Guinea’s fight against polio continues with unwavering determination and robust collaboration across all levels of society. With strong leadership, active community engagement, and steadfast international support, the country is working to interrupt transmission and protect every child—moving closer to ending polio in PNG once and for all.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1756494375.0,CVS and Walgreens Clamp Down on Covid Vaccines in Many States,"
CVS and Walgreens, the country’s two largest pharmacy chains, are for now clamping down on offering Covid vaccines in more than a dozen states, even to people who meet newly restricted criteria from the Food and Drug Administration.

On Thursday, Amy Thibault, a spokeswoman for CVS, said the vaccine was not available at pharmacies in 16 states, citing “the current regulatory environment” and emphasizing that the list could change.

On Friday, CVS issued an update: It could administer vaccines in 13 of the 16 states, and in the District of Columbia, to people who had obtained a prescription from a doctor or other medical provider. (As of Friday morning, its online scheduling tool still did not allow anybody to book an appointment in those places; Ms. Thibault said an update was in progress.) In Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico, CVS still cannot offer the shots at all, Ms. Thibault said.

She did not provide an explanation for the change.

Walgreens did not respond to requests for information. But when a New York Times reporter tried to schedule vaccine appointments in all 50 states, the Walgreens website said patients would need a prescription in 16 of them. Though there is some overlap, it’s not the same set of 16 as CVS, underscoring the level of confusion.

The shifting requirements for vaccines have fueled deep uncertainty about whether — and where — Americans can access the shots.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long condemned Covid vaccines and has made a number of false claims about their safety and utility, which has already complicated this year’s vaccine rollout. Under his leadership, health agencies have issued confusing guidance about Covid vaccines, narrowed the eligibility criteria for the shots and replaced members of the C.D.C.’s vaccine committee with people who have objected to Covid vaccines, sowing chaos.

Requiring prescriptions for the shots is a total change in practice, said Dr. Marc Sala, a co-director of the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive Covid-19 Center in Chicago.

Legal experts said that federal decisions were creating an extremely difficult situation for pharmacies to navigate. The biggest problem is that in some states, the law prohibits pharmacists from administering vaccines that are not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel.

[...] 

CVS will make the vaccines readily available nationwide if the advisory panel recommends them, Ms. Thibault said. (In the 34 states where the company hasn’t set limits, people can simply check a box when they make an appointment online to attest that they meet the F.D.A. criteria, without a prescription or other documentation.) But since the panel hasn’t yet made a decision, the company is holding back in states where it believes its pharmacists need a C.D.C. endorsement.

The states where CVS is requiring a prescription are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia, according to Ms. Thibault.

Based on The Times’s attempts to book appointments, Walgreens appears to require prescriptions in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, West Virginia and Wisconsin. In many states, appointments were unavailable, but it was not clear whether that was because of state laws or a lack of immediate vaccine supply.

Pharmacies have traditionally been a crucial access route to the Covid vaccine, accounting for a vast majority of shots given last year. The CVS and Walgreens moves are strong signals that federal decisions could reduce access more than the restrictions laid out on paper — not everyone has access to a doctor to obtain a prescription, for example. The confusion is likely to crop up at other pharmacies as well, legal experts said.

Experts are themselves divided on what pharmacies can do, but they agree that the choices are hard. [...] ",1n3g90p,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/cvs-pharmacy-covid-vaccine-16-states.html,482

They accused HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of “weaponizing public health for political gain” and “putting millions of American lives at risk” by purging health officials from government.

“When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda,” the lawyers Mark S. Zaid and Abbe Lowell wrote in a statement. “For that reason, she has been targeted.”

Wednesday’s shakeups — which include the resignation of the agency’s chief medical officer, the director of its infectious disease center and other key officials — add to the tumult at the nation’s premier public health agency. Kennedy and his allies have long criticized the CDC as too deferential to the pharmaceutical industry and vaccine makers. As the nation’s top health official, Kennedy has upended vaccine policies, including on Wednesday narrowing approval of coronavirus vaccines to high-risk groups, and he has taken steps medical experts worry are undermining the nation’s public health response.

Monarez, who was confirmed in late July, was pressed for days by Kennedy, administration lawyers and other officials over whether she would support rescinding certain approvals for coronavirus vaccines, according to two people with knowledge of those conversations. Kennedy, who has a long history of anti-vaccine advocacy, and other officials questioned Monarez on Monday on whether she was aligned with the administration’s efforts to change vaccine policy, the people said.

Kennedy and one of his top advisers Stefanie Spear also pushed Monarez to fire her senior staff by the end of this week, according to an administration official and another person with direct knowledge of that conversation. Spear did not immediately return a request for comment. [...] 

Monarez declined to immediately resign and enlisted Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), chairman of the Senate’s health committee who cast a pivotal vote for Kennedy’s confirmation after securing commitments to protect vaccines, said three people with knowledge of those conversations. Cassidy privately pushed back on Kennedy’s demands, the people said, further angering Kennedy, who lambasted Monarez for involving the senator.

Administration officials instructed Monarez to either resign or be fired, the people said. The officials and other people familiar with efforts to oust Monarez spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive personnel matter. [...]

Treatment of Bordetella pertussis infections relies on macrolide antibiotics including azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin. However, genetic mutations in the bacteria’s 23S rRNA reduces drug effectiveness for treating patients and contacts. Since 2024, antibiotic-resistant pertussis cases have been detected in four Americas countries: Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and the United States.

PAHO said widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics like azithromycin during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the emergence of resistant pertussis strains.

Pilar Ramón-Pardo, MD, PhD, who heads PAHO’s special program on antibiotic resistance, said vaccination, surveillance, and responsible use of antibiotics are critical to prevent pertussis from becoming a serious public health threat again. Scientists shared their concerns during a recent meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance. “We still have time to contain this issue, but we must act now: increase vaccination coverage, strengthen early detection, and enhance our outbreak response capacity,” she added.

The emergence of resistant strains comes amid a global resurgence of pertussis over the past few years due to declining vaccination rates. Countries in the Americas recorded 4,139 cases in 2023, with the total surging to 43,751 in 2024. In the first 7 months of 2025, countries have already reported 18,595 cases, 128 of them fatal.  

During the pandemic, regional coverage of the first and third diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine in the Americas declined to historic lows and has partially recovered. However, PAHO said the rates remain below the 95% recommended levels, with significant disparities within countries. Alongside childhood vaccination, PAHO recommends immunization for pregnant women, especially during outbreaks, and health workers who have contact with newborns.",1n1uwpr,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/paho-warns-antibiotic-resistant-pertussis-spreading,63

""I had weakness down the left hand side, palsy on the left hand side and I got tremors... the weakness and tremors are still there a year on.""

West Nile virus mainly spreads between birds, but can also infect people if they are bitten by an infected mosquito.

In humans it either causes no symptoms or only minor ones, like headaches, fevers, and skin issues, but in rare cases it can cause brain infections and death.

The virus was first detected in the West Nile region of Uganda in the late 1930s, but has spread to other continents like Asia, North America and Europe.

There have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile virus in the UK to date, but two years ago the first UK mosquito carrying the virus was detected near Retford, Nottinghamshire.

**No longer tropical'**

There is no vaccine for the virus but the University of Liverpool, along with The Pandemic Institute, is trying to create one that would also incorporate other mosquito-borne diseases.

Dr Krishanthi Subramaniam said a vaccine was ""needed because we are seeing cases of West Nile and other viruses that belong to this family increasing"".

She said: ""Due to the warmer weather we are seeing; a lot of the mosquitos that transmit these viruses reside locally, in a lot of countries in Europe, like France and Spain.

""Spain had a big outbreak of West Nile last year.

""I don't think there are any more 'tropical viruses'... the geographic barrier of these viruses no longer exist because of climate change."" [...]

Mr Skinner is still recovering after catching the virus last year and said he wanted to raise awareness because ""most people have not heard of West Nile virus"".

""I was treated with some scepticism when I told some people what I had,"" he said.

""It is worrying that we now do have the right weather conditions for this virus and if more people get it, it could mean more lives turned upside down, like mine.""",1n1pcb3,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w850qlx94o,25
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1756215064.0,Ontario facing shortage of rabies treatments amid record demand,"Less than a year after the death of a Brantford child who came in contact with a rabid bat, Ontario is experiencing a critical shortage of immunoglobulin treatment amid surging demand.

Ottawa has seen record demand for post-exposure rabies treatment this year, and Ottawa Public Health says it is in close contact with the Ministry of Health to make sure it is able to meet the demand. [...] 

The province has adequate supply of rabies vaccines, said Ema Popovic, spokesperson for Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones. Government sources say the province is working with the federal government to order additional supply in order to maintain the supply of vaccines and ensure there is enough immunoglobulin to meet demand in the province.

Ottawa Public Health also says it has an adequate supply of vaccines, but it is “keeping a close watch on the weekly use of rabies immunoglobulin, which is administered in hospitals and has been in shorter supply.”

In a statement, OPH said it has, so far, been able to meet demand for rabies immunoglobulin but is in contact with the Ministry of Health “to ensure we have enough supply to continue to meet the need.”

Demand for rabies post-exposure treatment has reached record levels in Ottawa and across Ontario this year, for the second year in a row. That is believed to be, in part, in response to reports of the rabies death of a child last year near Brantford, and public health information that followed the death. It was the first death in Ontario related to rabies since 1967.

Ottawa Public Health said it has coordinated the distribution or administration of post-exposure prophylaxis to 363 people so far this year. That is higher than the annual total for all of 2024 — 310 doses — which was already the highest on record. Prior to 2024, an average of 188 people a year received prophylaxis treatment for rabies.

Across the province, animal rabies cases were up by 60 per cent in 2024, with 90 cases compared to 56 a year earlier, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. All the cases in 2024 were in bats.

[...] Rabies exposure are risk assessed by a public health inspector. When it meets criteria for treatment, individuals are advised to consult their health-provider for assessment. OPH supplies rabies post-exposure prophylaxis to healthcare providers or offers it in its immunization clinics for people without available healthcare providers.

In a memo to Ottawa physicians and nurse practitioners written earlier this week, OPH’s Associate Medical Officer of Health Dr. Michelle Foote said Ottawa Public Health is working closely with the Ministry of Health to prioritize supply for high-risk exposures and ensure that health care professionals have access to rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin.

Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist who has repeatedly claimed in the face of scientific consensus that the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus, told the Daily Beast that Kennedy’s stance is shared by “influential” members of President Donald Trump’s family. Like Kennedy himself, no Trumps hold any scientific qualifications.

Malhotra is a leading adviser to the controversial lobby group Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Action, which is seen as an external arm of Kennedy’s agenda as Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary.

He told the Beast that many of those closest to RFK Jr. have told him they “cannot understand” why the vaccine continues to be prescribed, and that a decision to remove the vaccine from the U.S. market pending further research will come “within months,” even if it is likely to cause “fear of chaos” and bring with it major legal ramifications.

“It could [happen] in a number of stages, including learning more about the data,” said Malhotra, who said there was an ongoing review into so-called “vaccine injuries” by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). “But given the increased talk of vaccine injuries in the past few weeks among the administration, it could also come with one clean decision.” [...] 

The Daily Beast contacted the White House, the HHS, Pfizer, and Moderna for comment.

Only the White House responded. Its spokesman, Kush Desai, said: “The Administration is relying on Gold Standard Science and is committed to radical transparency to make decisions that affect all Americans. Unless announced by the Administration, however, any discussion about HHS policy should be dismissed as baseless speculation.”

The outbreak has been under way for the past 8 months, and 16 of the patients who died are from Sumenep district, according the report, which cited data from the Sumenep District Health Agency.

Indonesia is grappling with a gap in childhood immunization, with just 72% of children younger than age 5 receiving the measles vaccine last year, well below the 95% population coverage needed to prevent outbreaks. For some provinces, the measles immunization rate is below 50%. 

Indonesia experienced a large measles outbreak in 2018 in Papua province that was complicated by religious concerns that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine contained pork. Indonesian health officials have called on residents, community officials, and religious leaders to support immunization efforts in Sumenep, which is targeting 78,000 children ages 9 months to 6 years. 

The outbreak is occurring against the backdrop of a global rise in cases, including in North America.

Flu and RSV vaccines remain business as usual this fall: if you’re eligible, you should be able to get them without issue. Vaccinations should start in September.

Covid-19 vaccines are another story. Federal policy shifts have left a vacuum, and multiple groups are stepping in to fill it. The key questions remain: Who qualifies? Where will vaccines be available? What’s covered by insurance? What’s not?

There will be three key developments this week:

Tuesday: The Vaccine Integrity Project—an outside group formed in response to federal vaccine policy changes—will meet tomorrow to review the latest evidence on Covid-19, flu, and RSV vaccine effectiveness and safety. Their findings matter because insurers, physicians, and other groups are seeking third-party validation of scientific evidence after the ACIP committee revealed minimal regard for facts. This meeting will be public HERE. I have been selected to be on the panel, so if you attend, I’ll see you there.

Shortly after: Professional organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, are expected to issue recommendations on who should receive Covid-19 vaccines based on the latest scientific evidence.

Friday (or soon after): **The FDA is expected to license the Covid-19 vaccine. Word is that the label will be restricted to adults 65+ and people at high risk.**

Expect discord. The Vaccine Integrity Project and professional organizations will almost certainly not align with RFK Jr.’s FDA license. This rarely happens, so it will cause confusion.

What this means for you: Prepare for lots of headlines and mixed messages this week. I’ll return next week with a clear breakdown of what it all means for you. **In the meantime, if you’re under 65 and not high risk, the window to get a Covid-19 vaccine is right now—before the FDA label changes.**

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1755545381.0,Covid-19 seems to age blood vessels – but only among women,"Covid-19 seems to accelerate the ageing of blood vessels, but perhaps only among women.

The infection has previously been linked to cardiovascular complications, like heart disease, but how it has this effect isn’t entirely clear. To learn more, Rosa Maria Bruno at the Université Paris Cité in France and her colleagues recruited 2390 people, aged 50 on average, from 16 countries – including the UK and US – between September 2020 and February 2022.

Some of them had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, or had antibodies against it despite not being vaccinated, a sign that they had been infected. The others had only ever tested negative for the virus and had no signs of prior infection.

The health of their arteries was assessed by measuring how fast a pressure wave passed between the carotid artery in their neck and the femoral arteries in their legs. This is a measure of artery stiffness, which increases naturally with age, with less flexible arteries raising the risk of heart disease.

The researchers found that among the women in the study, a known SARS-CoV-2 infection was linked to stiffer arteries. This also seemed to increase alongside the severity of their infection. For instance, women who were hospitalised with covid-19 had a vascular age that was around five years older than their uninfected counterparts, rising to 7.5 years among those admitted to intensive care.

The researchers controlled for other factors that can influence artery stiffness, like smoking and obesity.
But none of these effects occurred among the men. Previous research suggests that women react more strongly to infections than men and are less able to dial down their immune response, which could lead to damaging inflammation. Bruno says she was expecting to see some difference between the sexes, but not this much.

It’s possible that some of the people in the uninfected group may have unknowingly had a mild infection, affecting the validity of the results.

Nevertheless, Vassilios Vassiliou at the University of East Anglia in the UK says the study is robust and could help identify people with long covid. “The study is the first large international multicentre investigation to demonstrate that covid-19 is associated with accelerated vascular ageing,” he says. “The findings may also contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of post covid-19 syndrome, potentially paving the way for targeted pharmacological interventions.”

As of today, 762 cases of measles have been confirmed in the outbreak since late January, with more than two thirds of the cases in children. Ninety-nine people (13%) were hospitalized over the course of the outbreak, and there were two fatalities in school-aged children, according to the statement from the DSHS.

""I want to highlight the tireless work of the public health professionals across the state who contributed to the containment of one of the most contagious viruses,"" said DSHS Commissioner Jennifer A. Shuford, MD, MPH. ""I also want to recognize the many health care professionals who identified and treated cases of a virus that most providers had never seen in person before this outbreak.""

The DSHS said although the outbreak is over, there will likely be more measles cases diagnosed in Texas this year as since there are ongoing measles outbreaks in North America. ""The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a measles-containing vaccine,"" the agency said

The West Texas outbreak, which was initially linked to a Mennonite community, kicked off what has become the worst year for measles activity in the United States since the virus was eliminated in 2000.

In related news, Colorado has confirmed another measles case, this time involving an adult in the Grand Junction area who had not traveled outside the state, suggesting possible local spread. The Mesa County resident was unvaccinated. 

The new case raises Colorado's measles case count this year to 20, after recording only 5 illnesses in the previous decade. The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment listed several potential exposure sites in Grand Junction.

Combined with funding cuts to public vaccination programs, chilling effects of immigration policies on health care, and the wearying battle by school nurses to balance parental consent and overall student body health, Texas schools are on track to have the lowest vaccination rates in decades if exemption rates continue to climb.

“I do think that there is a problem — period — that is worse than we have known about previously,” said Terri Burke, executive director of The Immunization Partnership, which advocates for public policies that support increased access to vaccines.

Since 2018, **the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for a vaccine exemption form have doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.**

In July, ahead of the new school year, the state received 17,197 requests for a vaccine exemption form, **36% higher than the number reported in July 2023. Because each requestor can have forms for up to eight individuals, the number of children those forms covered also soared — 23,231 in July 2023 compared to 30,596 in July 2025.**

Now, as some public health departments indicate there are drops in the number of poorer children coming to them to get vaccinated during the summer months, and a new Sept. 1 law that will make the vaccination exemption form downloadable instead of it being mailed, vaccine experts fear herd immunity will be tougher to achieve.

Rebecca Hardy, president of Texans for Vaccine Choice, which successfully lobbied for the easier exemption process, suggests the fears are overblown. She said she hasn’t seen an increase in interest in exemption forms and insists that her organization exists to “support all parents, regardless of how they vaccinate.”[...] ",1mtm5h2,https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/,147

The regional agency within the World Health Organization, which covers North and South America, says there has been an exponential rise in measles this year.

As of Aug. 8, it recorded 10,139 confirmed measles cases across ten countries, representing a 33-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024, when there were 311 cases.

Canada leads the pack with 4,548 measles cases, particularly in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario.

PAHO says low vaccination rates are primarily to blame, with U.S. and Mexico also seeing large outbreaks over the past year.

The health agency says countries should strengthen routine immunization and conduct targeted vaccination campaigns in high-risk communities.

Vaccine coverage rates in the region are 79 per cent for the two doses needed, which is below the 95 per cent recommended to prevent outbreaks.

The group’s data shows 18 people have died as a result of the outbreak: 14 in Mexico, three in the United States and a newborn in Canada.

PAHO says outbreaks have particularly been identified in Mennonite communities, but adds recent data suggests an increasing number of cases outside of these groups.

In Mexico, PAHO says a mass vaccination campaign is underway in Chihuahua, where most of its 3,911 infections have occurred.

“Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a case-fatality rate 20 times higher than in the general population,” its report says.

The U.S. has reported outbreaks in 41 jurisdictions, with a total of 1,356 cases.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1755111452.0,Alberta’s Bizarre and Dangerous Vaccine Experiment Begins,"Alberta’s bizarre and dangerous experiment in vaccine rationing began Monday with the appearance of a website where Albertans can register to be considered for COVID-19 immunization sometime in the fall if any vaccine is left. You might get vaccinated, or you might not.

By the way, most of you who manage to get an appointment to be immunized will have to pay for it. No one in Danielle Smith’s United Conservative Party government is saying yet how much you’ll have to pay. They dropped a hint last month it might be $110. Once again, maybe, maybe not. Could be less; could be more.

They’re also going to make you go through the same excessively bureaucratic process to get an influenza shot this fall, by the way, but no one will have to pay for that one... yet.

So you should go to bookvaccine.alberta.ca now to register for Alberta’s answer to Lotto 6/49 for people who are, as U.S. comedian Stephen Colbert put it the other night in a routine about vaccination policy south of the Medicine Line, “fans of living.”

No one knows exactly how Premier Smith’s perverse experiment in vaccine rationing will end, but you can count on it that it’ll end badly.

University of Calgary political scientist Lisa Young called the new website the start of “the Vaccine Games.”

Mulling over how to describe this disaster in the making today, it occurred to me this could be called the formal beginning of UCP Death Panels.

Anyway, both sort of capture the spirit of the moment as Smith’s government goes about implementing what it called in a press release in June a “new approach to COVID-19 immunizations,” even if neither gets it quite right.

Young’s little joke notwithstanding, there is no competition to see who will be allowed to get the vaccine, of which Alberta’s pure MAGA government plans to order hundreds of thousands of doses fewer than will be required. Just chaos. No one really knows what the mechanism will be for choosing who gets it.

We do know, as journalist Andrew Nikiforuk pointed out in The Tyee last week, “the Smith government has reduced the volume of available vaccine by nearly 250,000 doses. Last year the province administered 750,000 doses — largely to people over 50 years of age. This year the province has ordered only 485,000 doses, a 30 per cent reduction. That means a quarter of the population, again mostly the elderly, that wants the vaccine will not find it available.”

But it’s far too optimistic to hope there’s anything as well organized as a death panel behind this chaotic mess, or for that matter any kind of a panel. Frankly, I’d be surprised if the cowed officials running this gong show for the UCP have any idea yet how they’re going to determine who gets the vaccine and who doesn’t.

The process is perversely — and clearly intentionally — complicated. It is obviously intended to discourage as many people as possible from getting the vaccine. 

You’ll have to go to a limited number of public health clinics to get a shot. No more quick visits to a nearby pharmacy. “This decision makes no sense; it instead creates unfair barriers to those who work shifts, lack transportation, or are unable to get to vaccine-delivery locations,” wrote a group of public health experts in an Edmonton Journal op-ed last week.

“This ‘new approach’ creates obstacles to immunization against a serious vaccine-preventable disease that caused over 380 deaths last year — and unfairly disadvantages Albertans who would receive COVID shots free of charge anywhere else in the country,” the authors of the op-ed wrote.

“This policy is so bad that it’s actually worse than their usual failure to plan properly,” former Alberta chief medical officer of health James Talbot told Nikiforuk. “In fact, it is so bad it looks like they are actually planning to fail.”

You may wonder, Why the hell would a Canadian government do that? Well, Smith, her seldom-heard-from minister of preventive health services, Adriana LaGrange, or anyone in the UCP is certainly not going to tell us. [...] 

And if you’re a fan of living, let me say it again: you’d better go to bookvaccine.alberta.ca or dial 811 now, or you may discover that you’re not eligible to receive the vaccine at all, no matter how vulnerable you are.

COVID-19 vaccines should be available for every Albertan who wants one. They should be available at pharmacies as well as public health clinics. And they should be free to all.

Alberta public health policy should be about health, not MAGA politics inside the UCP.  [Tyee]

Kennedy Jr. is considering changes to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) yesterday issued a statement reminding the public and policymakers that vaccines are responsible for some of the greatest gains in protecting people and increasing life expectancy and that access to vaccine should be strongly protected. The group added that serious vaccine-related injuries are rare, but when they occur, patients and families deserve the utmost care and compassion. The IDSA said it's important that VICP work as Congress intended, adding that any changes to improve the program should be made transparently with participation from Congress, specialty groups with expertise in vaccines, and patients. ""Specifically, it is important that the VICP be funded appropriately to compensate injured individuals without putting an infeasible burden on vaccine manufacturers that could jeopardize severely the availability of safe and effective vaccines for the public,"" IDSA President Tina Tan, MD, said in the statement. Established in 1986 following concerns about a since-discontinued whole-cell pertussis vaccine, the VICP is designed to protect vaccine makers from most lawsuits alleging vaccine-related injury, while giving people claiming such injuries an opportunity to get a fair hearing and potentially receive compensation.


Two Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections, one of them fatal, have been linked to venison—a rare source of the infection—from the same processing facility in Puryear, Tennessee, Food Safety News noted yesterday, citing a report from the Tennessee Department of Health. One of the patients is a 4-year-old girl from Tennessee who died from her infection in May. The investigation found a second case in a Texas resident who was sick in November and had a matching outbreak strain, and the only common food was venison from the processing facility. The Texas patient's family had traveled to Kentucky before she became ill. Investigators didn't find any violations at the producer, suggesting that the meat itself may have been contaminated.

Federal health officials are investigating the sources of two Cyclospora outbreaks, one that has sickened 30 people and another that has sickened 41, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in its latest Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation (CORE) Network update. The illnesses were originally thought to have been linked to one outbreak, but epidemiologic information from state partners and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests two distinct outbreaks. The FDA has started a trace-back investigation for the event with 30 cases identified so far. Foodborne infections from the Cyclospora cayetanensis parasite typically rise in the summer. Past outbreaks were linked to fresh produce, such as cilantro, basil, snow peas, and raspberries, but sometimes a specific source isn't identified. Profuse diarrhea that can last several weeks is the main symptoms of the disease, which is endemic in some tropical countries.",1mpg1fw,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/quick-takes-concerns-about-changes-vaccine-injury-program-venison-linked-e-coli,22
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1755091017.0,Livestock implicated in spread of ancient strain of plague,"The pathogen that causes plague has been identified in a 4,000-year-old domesticated-sheep carcass, suggesting that livestock helped transmit an early, mysterious form of plague that circulated throughout Eurasia during the Late Neolithic Bronze Age (LNBA), according to a study published yesterday in Cell.

Roughly 5,000 years ago, a mysterious kind of plague distinct from that responsible for bubonic plague spread among people throughout Eurasia before disappearing 3,000 years later, leaving scientists curious about its probable zoonotic source and transmission, said the study team, led by Max Planck Institute researchers in Germany.

The investigators studied sheep bones and teeth excavated at Arkaim, a former site of the Sintashta-Petrovka culture, which was known for cattle, sheep, and horse husbandry on the Western Eurasian Steppe.

Until now, the genome of ancient Yersinia pestis bacteria, which can't spread via fleas as in bubonic plague, had been identified only in ancient Eurasian humans because of a lack of direct DNA evidence tying animals to human infections in prehistory.

Arkaim ""offered us a great place to look for plague clues: they were early pastoralist societies without the kind of grain storage that would attract rats and their fleas—and prior Sintashta individuals have been found with Y. pestis infections,"" coauthor Taylor Hermes, PhD, of the University of Arkansas and Max Planck Institute, said in an institute news release.

Many infectious diseases emerged during prehistory, coinciding with animal domestication, which presented opportunities for spillover into people, they added. For example, the domestication of sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle and their interface with people are thought to have driven the emergence of deadly human pathogens causing infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, salmonellosis, and measles.

**Sheep, humans probably not main spreaders of disease**

A comparison of the ancient Y pestis genome from the sheep with other ancient and modern genomes revealed that the sheep Y pestis genome closely matched one that had infected a human at a nearby site at about the same time. 

We collect evidence supporting a scenario where the LNBA lineage, unable to efficiently transmit via fleas, spread from an unidentified reservoir to sheep and likely other domesticates, elevating human infection risk.

""We show that this ancient lineage underwent ancestral gene decay paralleling extant lineages, but evolved under distinct selective pressures, contributing to its lack of geographic differentiation,"" the authors wrote.

""Collectively, our results connect prehistoric livestock with infectious disease in humans and showcase the power of moving paleomicrobiology into the zooarchaeological record,"" they concluded.

But sheep and humans are unlikely to have been the main spreaders of disease, because there are examples of nearly identical LNBA Y pestis genomes at the same time but thousands of kilometers apart, which the researchers say is too far for sick humans or land animals to travel.

Fortunately, the search for pathogens in ancient animal remains is just beginning, because results from past excavations are available for further study. ""I think there will be more and more interest in analyzing these collections—they give us insights that no human sample can,"" senior author Felix Key, PhD, of Max Planck Institute, said in the release.",1mp46th,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/plague/livestock-implicated-spread-ancient-strain-plague,45
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1755028119.0,‘Petri dish for disease’: attorney raises alarm of possible Covid outbreak at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’,"An outbreak of a respiratory disease, possibly Covid-19, is running rampant through the remote Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz”, according to the attorney of an infected detainee removed from the camp last week.

Eric Lee said he was told by his client Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez that conditions at the facility had deteriorated significantly since Thursday as more migrants held there by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency experienced symptoms.

Lee said authorities removed Rivas Velásquez, a 38-year-old Venezuelan man, from the camp after he was diagnosed in a hospital visit last week, then secretly taken to a similar facility in Texas.

Protesters at the gates of the jail in the heart of the Florida Everglades have recorded a number of instances of ambulances arriving and leaving.

Lee said the hastily erected tented camp, which Democratic lawmakers have decried for holding thousands of undocumented detainees in cages as they await deportation, is a “petri dish for disease”.

He added: “Based on what multiple detainees have told me, in the last 72 to 100 hours, there is some respiratory disease which has made the majority, or I would even say vast majority of detainees, sick in some form.

“There are people who are losing breath. There are people who are walking around coughing on one another. Their requests for masks from the guards are denied, and they only are allowed to shower once or maybe twice a week.

“I said to Luis, ‘pass the phone. Let me hear it from somebody else. I just want to make sure that people’s stories are straight.’ And unfortunately they very much are.”

The development follows a claim by a woman, a state licensed corrections officer, who said she contracted Covid-19 after working at the camp in unsanitary conditions for about a week last month, and was subsequently fired.

“We had to use the porta-johns. We didn’t have hot water half the time. Our bathrooms were backed up,” the woman told NBC6 News after being granted anonymity to discuss conditions there.

“[The detainees] have no sunlight. There’s no clock in there. They don’t even know what time of the day it is. The bathrooms are backed up because so many people [are] using them.”

The Florida department of emergency management, which is responsible for operations at the jail, did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment.

In a statement to the Miami New Times, Stephanie Hartman, a department spokesperson, did not answer questions about a possible outbreak, but insisted: “Detainees have access to a 24/7, fully staffed medical facility with a pharmacy on site.”

Lee said Rivas Velásquez told him in a phone call that he pleaded for medical attention for 48 hours after contracting breathing difficulties, and eventually collapsed inside the metal cage in which he and dozens of other inmates were being held.

He said his client was taken to Miami’s Kendall regional medical center, where he was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, then returned only briefly to the Everglades camp before disappearing for three days. Lee said Rivas Velásquez called on Sunday from a new detention camp in El Paso, Texas.

“He said when he was returned to the Alcatraz facility he asked the guards to provide his medical records and they said they would not do that,” Lee said.

“The guards came to his bed, opened his pillow, took all the poetry and letters he’d been writing, and all the notes he’d been taking about his experiences, and told him he’s no longer allowed to write.”

Apart from the brief call from Texas, Lee said he had no further information about his client’s wellbeing.

“I haven’t heard from him for two days now. I have no idea how he’s doing or frankly whether he’s alive or not. It’s hard to wage a legal fight when you don’t even have access to your client,” he said.

If the outbreak is Covid, Lee added, it would have consequences beyond Alligator Alcatraz. [...] ",1moixhq,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/attorney-covid-outbreak-alligator-alcatraz,532
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754957342.0,Over 31 cases of polio in Papua New Guinea - WHO,"In Papua New Guinea, more than 31 cases of polio have been detected since the disease re-emerged earlier this year.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the numbers on Monday, as PNG launched a national immunisation campaign in Port Moresby.

The WHO declared an outbreak in May after two children were confirmed to have the virus.

Polio or poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease that mainly affects children under five. It can also affect older age groups.

Most people who have it have no symptoms, but it can lead to irreversible paralysis in about one in 200 infections, or one percent of cases.

The virus is spread by person-to-person contact or the ingestion of contaminated virus from faeces. Because the virus multiplies in the gut of infected people, who then shed it in their stool for several weeks, it can spread through a community, particularly in areas with poor sanitation.

The WHO said over 31 detections of the virus had been confirmed in Papua New Guinea through environmental and community surveillance since May. While no cases of paralysis had been reported, the risk of further transmission remained high due to low immunisation rates and poor access to children who lived in remote areas.

The WHO said the vaccine campaign would focus on the mainland provinces, of which 17 had been identified as high-risk areas. Here, both the oral polio vaccine and the polio vaccine jab were due to be administered.

The New Guinea Islands provinces had been deemed lower-risk, and one round of the polio vaccine injection had been planned.

""This moment represents more than just a public health initiative - it is a bold step forward in our shared mission to secure the health and future of Papua New Guinea's youngest generation,"" WHO Papua New Guinea representative Dr Masahiro Zakoji said.

Last year, UNICEF highlighted Papua New Guinea's low childhood immunisation coverage.

It found only about 50 percent of children born each year received ""essential life-saving vaccines"", which included the oral polio vaccine. That left about 120,000 children unvaccinated each year, the agency said.

It said to prevent outbreaks and reach herd immunity against polio, vaccine coverage should be at least 95 percent.

The agency said that while the global prevalence of the disease had plummeted by more than 99 percent in the past 35 years, millions of children were still affected because they missed out on the vaccine.

Most of these children (85 percent) were living in ""fragile settings"", UNICEF said. These included countries and communities where there was conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had been declared polio-free, but 18 years later, an outbreak of vaccine-derived polio type 1 was declared. It resulted in 26 cases across nine provinces in 2018.

The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said this strain is related to the weakened live polio virus used in oral polio vaccine. If allowed to circulate in populations which have low immunisation rates or are unimmunised ""for long enough"", or replicate in ""an immunodeficient individual"", the weakened virus can revert to a form that causes illness and paralysis, the CDC said.

The WHO said the 2018 Papua New Guinea outbreak was brought under control through further rounds of vaccination, community engagement and better surveillance of the disease.

Meanwhile, the current outbreak is related to vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754827580.0,Texas prepares for war as invasion of flesh-eating flies appears imminent,"Texas is gearing up for war as a savage, flesh-eating fly appears poised for a US invasion and is expanding its range of victims.

On Friday, the Texas Department of Agriculture announced the debut of TDA Swormlure, a synthetic bait designed to attract the flies with a scent that mimics open flesh wounds, which are critical to the lifecycle of the fly, called the New World Screwworm. The parasite exploits any open wound or orifice on a wide range of warm-blooded animals to feed its ravenous spawn. Female flies lay hundreds of eggs in even the tiniest abrasion. From there, screw-shaped larvae—which give the flies their name—emerge to literally twist and bore into their victim, eating them alive and causing a putrid, life-threatening lesion. (You can see a graphic example here on a deer.)

The new lure for the flies is just one of several defense efforts in Texas, which stands to suffer heavy livestock losses from an invasion. Screwworms are a ferocious foe to many animals, but are particularly devastating to farm animals.

""When it comes to safeguarding Texas' $15 billion cattle industry, we need to focus on action rather than words. That's why I instructed my Biosecurity team to develop an effective screwworm lure,"" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in the announcement.

But cattle industry losses aren't the only grave risk from the vicious parasites. In Colombia, endemic screwworms have apparently grown bolder in their taste for flesh. This week, biologists and researchers reported in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases that the worms caused life-threatening infections in two wild mountain tapirs, an endangered species that lives in a protected area of the Central Andes. While there had been anecdotal reports of screwworm infestations in mountain tapirs, they were not previously considered a threat to the herbivorous mammals. **The authors noted that it's unclear why the fly has suddenly emerged in mountain tapirs, which resemble wild pigs with trunks, but climate change and livestock movements could be causing the flies to expand their appetites.**

[...] 

The main method to wipe out screwworms is the sterile insect technique (SIT), which exploits a weakness in the fly's life cycle since they tend to only mate once. In the 1950s, researchers at the US Department of Agriculture figured out they could use gamma radiation to sterilize male flies without affecting their ability to find mates. They then bred massive amounts of male flies, sterilized them, and carpet-bombed infested areas with aerial releases, which tanked the population.

Panama, in partnership with the US, maintained the biological barrier at the Colombian border with continual sterile-fly bombings for years. But as the flies approached this year, the USDA shifted its aerial deliveries to Mexico. In June, the USDA announced plans to set up a new sterile fly facility in Texas for aerial deliveries to northern Mexico. And last month, the USDA halted livestock trade from southern entry points.

Miller said in the announcement today that SIT is no longer enough, and Texas is taking its own steps. Those include the new bait, insecticides, and new feed for livestock and deer laced with the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin. Miller also said that the state aims to develop a vaccine for cattle that could kill larvae, but such a shot is still in development.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754841005.0,Pfizer Covid vaccine for young children may not be renewed by FDA,"Pfizer’s Covid vaccine for young children may not be renewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this fall, prompting Moderna to fill possible gaps in supply, according to an email obtained by the Guardian.

The move would pull the only remaining Covid vaccine for all children under five from the market.

The Moderna vaccine is only approved for children with one or more health conditions, and the pediatric Covid vaccine from Novavax is only available for children aged 12 and up with health conditions.

“It certainly would create a hole in the availability of vaccines,” said Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.

“And to do it this late in the season – I think clearly it’s inappropriate.”

According to an email from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Pfizer said the FDA recently informed the pharmaceutical company that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its pediatric Covid vaccine for the 2025 respiratory season.

The email was sent on Friday to state and local vaccination grantees.

The Pfizer vaccine is given to children between the ages of six months and four years.

Pfizer expects its Covid vaccine for children aged five to 11 to be fully licensed this fall, the email said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is “in discussions” with Moderna about rapidly increasing its Covid vaccine supply for young children, according to the email.

That includes internal planning about volume, timing, and potential supply gaps.

“We are working to ensure there will be sufficient supply,” said Chris Ridley, a Moderna spokesperson.

The CDC, the US Department for Health and Human Services (HHS), and Pfizer did not respond to media inquiries by publication time.

In July, Moderna received FDA approval of its Covid pediatric shot. But the vaccine was only approved for children with one or more health conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid. This move could limit access to Covid vaccines.

“We already have a low number of people using the vaccines to start with,” Benjamin said.

“There hasn’t been enough promotion of vaccinations for kids, and then you have Mr [Robert F] Kennedy’s [Jr] unscientific statements about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, particularly Covid vaccines, for both pregnant women and kids. It has muddied the waters of what people know about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.”

The vaccine is extremely effective, especially against hospitalization and death.

Yet only 5.6% of children aged six months to four years are vaccinated against Covid, and about 15% of children aged five to 17 are vaccinated, according to the CDC.

While older adults have the highest rates of hospitalization and death, children continue seeing hospitalization rates from Covid similar to rates in 2020 and 2021.

And there are other concerns with Covid infection.

“We don’t know the long-term impact for kids who have gotten Covid as a disease. We do know it does cause a multi-systemic inflammatory process in a number of kids, which is very severe, and we don’t know the long-term implications for long Covid in kids,” Benjamin said.

The last time the province reported new cases in the single digits was on Jan. 16 when just two cases were added to the tally.

But as the outbreak expanded, health officials were at times dealing with hundreds of new infections per week.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754488264.0,STDs are rampant in Mississippi. This one is now considered an epidemic.,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - If you gathered 100 Mississippians in a room, statistically, at least 1 of them has an STD.

The STD rate, depending on your source, is around 1,200 per 100,000 Mississippian, or 1 per every 100. The state has long been plagued by high rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV.

In years prior, Hinds County had the dishonor of having the highest STD rate of any county in the country.

However, the state’s current boom of congenital syphilis, which follows a nationwide trend, has the medical community now labeling it an epidemic.

According to a 2023 report from the CDC, Mississippi ranked 3rd in the country for reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis. In that same report, Mississippi ranked 5th for gonorrhea and 2nd for chlamydia.

Syphilis, like other sexually transmitted diseases, is spread through bacteria upon contact with infected fluids; this usually happening through sex or various sex acts.

With most STDs, the symptoms can make themselves known in a plethora of ways, including painful sores, a burning sensation, or a type of discharge.

What makes syphilis different, and in some ways harder to detect, is that, at first, its symptoms can be minor - if any at all.

Dr. Kayla Stover, professor and vice chair of pharmacy practice at The University of Mississippi, explained that a symptom one might have in the first stage of syphilis is a painless sore, or chancre, that would go away even without treatment.

But though it is no longer visibly apparent, says Dr. Stover, the disease, if left untreated, could lie undetected in the body for years. And while lying undetected, the disease could slowly progress in its victim’s body, leading to more damaging stages.

“And each of those stages has symptoms that could be mistaken for something else,” Dr. Stover says, which is why the disease is often referred to as “The Great Imitator.”

“Unless you are testing for syphilis, you might not know it’s there,” she continued.

In its second stage, or secondary syphilis, a rash might appear, usually on the palms.

It’s important to note here that in its early stages, syphilis is easily treatable, usually only requiring a shot of penicillin. But left untreated, the disease could continue to evolve, and one might enter the third stage: latent syphilis.

In this stage, the disease could cause damage to internal organs.

The last stage, tertiary syphilis, is the disease at its most severe, causing damage to the brain or heart. Paralysis and dementia are possible during this stage.

During all four stages, the carrier would still be infectious, possibly spreading it to various sexual partners. And if you are a mother, it could also spread to your child.

This is called congenital syphilis, and Mississippi has seen a 1,000% spike in the past few years, from 10 cases in 2016 to 110 in 2022. [...] 


Deja Abdul-Haqq, the director of My Brother’s Keeper, a local nonprofit focusing on public health, says they began seeing a spike in syphilis cases after the COVID-19 pandemic.

As for the reason for the spike, she said, “To break it down really simple: condomless sex.”

Abdul-Haqq would say there is a lack of information regarding condom use in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. While this would seemingly be a basic concept to most, in Mississippi, it’s complicated.

In Mississippi schools, sex-education classes cannot include instruction and demonstrations on how to use a condom. In 2015, a teacher in Starkville was suspended after a student in her class put a prophylactic on a cucumber.

That same year, a teacher went viral for side-stepping the condom rule by demonstrating how to put a sock on a foot.

Likewise, there is the lack, in Abdul-Haqq’s eyes, of information pertaining to modern prevention tools like PrEP, a medication which can prevent HIV infection, and Doxy-PEP, another medication that can prevent STDs such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.

“Imagine if all of these mothers that were exposed to syphilis during sex would have gotten Doxy-PEP within 72 hours,” she said.

Dr. Stover would echo some of Abdul-Haqq’s same points, saying that Mississippi’s sex education has not been as progressive as other states.

And in the era of medications such as PrEP and Doxy-PEP, Dr. Stover says that people may not be as scared of unprotected sex as they used to be.

One more state reported cases, Wisconsin, lifting the number of affected states to 41. Three more outbreaks were reported, putting the nation’s total at 32 for the year. For comparison, the country had 16 outbreaks for all of 2024. 

Of confirmed illnesses this year, 87% were part of outbreaks, compared with 69% for 2024. And of infected patients, 92% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Though about 65% of cases occurred in children, 34% were recorded in adults ages 20 years and older.

**Latest activity a mix of outbreaks and travel-linked cases**

Earlier in the outbreak, cases in the West Texas outbreak drove most of the activity, but since then smaller outbreaks in other states have accounted for many of the cases, along with infections linked to international travel. Some have involved travelers from other US states. For example, the New Mexico Department of Health on August 1 announced that a child from another state visited New Mexico while infectious and may have exposed people at locations in Santa Fe, including an art exhibit and a hotel. 

Elsewhere, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare recently reported that CDC-contracted testing has detected measles in a July 29 wastewater sample collected from Coeur d’Alene, though no confirmed or suspected measles cases have been reported from the Panhandle Health District.

Kerala state has now reported nine Nipah outbreaks since 2018, part of recurrent spillovers of the virus, which is spread by bats and can be transmitted to humans through infected animals, contaminated food, or contact with sick people. 

Two of the latest four patients are from Malappuram district, which had reported earlier cases. However, two are from Palakkad district, which had not reported previous cases. The first is an adult woman from Malappuram whose symptoms began on April 25 and whose illness progressed to acute encephalitis syndrome, which required intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. The second patient, another woman from the same district, became ill on June 23 and died on July 1 after visiting several healthcare facilities before a sample was collected for testing at a government hospital.

The third and fourth cases are both from Palakkad district, including a woman whose symptoms began on June 25 and is listed in critical condition. She is on a ventilator at a specialty hospital. The other is a man whose illness started on July 6. He was admitted to a private hospital a few days later, and died on July 12 after he was transferred to a hospital.

**No links between patients, fruit bats observed in area**

None of the patients have any epidemiological links to each other, and an investigation into the source of their infections is still underway, the WHO said. The lack of links suggests independent spillover events from a natural reservoir. “A significant presence of fruit bats, the known reservoir for NiV [Nipah virus] has been observed in the affected areas,” the group added.

The WHO said Kerala state has a strong health system and has improved its infection control measures since 2023. It urged Kerala health officials to continue strong surveillance and patient care efforts and advised other at-risk states in India to step-up their detection systems.

In Foshan city, which has been hit the hardest, chikungunya patients must stay in hospital, where their beds will protected with mosquito nets. They can only be discharged after they test negative or at the end of a week-long stay.

Spread through the bite of an infected mosquito, the virus causes fever and severe joint pain, which sometimes can last for years.

Although rare in China, chikungunya outbreaks are common in South and South East Asia and parts of Africa.

Aside from Foshan, at least 12 other cities in the southern Guangdong province have reported infections. Nearly 3,000 cases were reported in the last week alone.

On Monday, Hong Kong reported its first case - a 12-year-old boy who developed fever, rash and joint pain after traveling to Foshan in July.

The virus is not contagious, and only spreads when an infected person is bitten by a mosquito that then goes on to bite others.

Officials say all the reported cases have been mild so far, with 95% of the patients discharged within seven days.

Still, the cases have led to some panic, given the virus is not widely known in the country.

""This is scary. The prolonged consequences sound very painful,"" one user wrote on Chinese social media platform Weibo.

The US has urged travellers to China to exercise ""increased caution"" following the outbreak. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754405304.0,CDC: Global Summary of Recent Human Cases of H5N1 Bird Flu,"At a glance
Between January 1 and August 4, 2025, 26 human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses (H5 bird flu) have been detected globally, of which 23 were identified in 7 countries outside of the United States, including 11 infections that resulted in death.
The three cases in the United States were previously reported, and there have been no cases reported in the United States since mid-February 2025.
The 11 deaths occurred in Cambodia (8), India (2), and Mexico (1). All of these infections were in people with likely or reported direct contact with poultry and/or wild birds.

No person-to-person spread was identified in any of these cases, and their occurrence is not thought to change the health risk to the U.S. public, which remains low at this time.

Due to widespread global outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in wild birds and poultry, sporadic human infections with H5N1 virus are not surprising in persons with direct or close contact with sick or dead poultry or other infected animals, but they do underscore the importance of continued surveillance domestically and globally.

**Overview**

Avian influenza A viruses, including viruses that cause H5N1 bird flu, are different from human seasonal influenza viruses. Because most people lack pre-existing immunity to avian influenza viruses, these viruses have the potential to cause a flu pandemic in people if they were to gain the ability to more easily infect and spread efficiently between people. This is why it is important for every human infection from avian influenza A viruses to be reported and investigated.

CDC continues to work with global partners to identify and respond to human infections with avian influenza A viruses, like H5N1 viruses, which caused outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and other animals and 70 human cases in the United States during 2024 and early 2025.

**Summary of recent H5N1 human cases by country**

**Cambodia**

Fourteen human infections with influenza A(H5N1) virus, including eight deaths, have been reported in Cambodia during 2025. Of these infections, seven were in children. Currently available genetic sequencing of virus samples has identified these as H5 clade 2.3.2.1e* viruses, which have circulated among poultry in Cambodia and the region for many years. This H5 virus clade differs from the H5N1 viruses that has circulated in U.S. wild birds, poultry, and dairy cattle (clade 2.3.4.4b).

Between 2023-2025, 30 human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses were reported in Cambodia. Cambodian health officials, in collaboration with U.S. CDC and global partners, have increased clinician outreach and awareness to quickly detect and report human bird flu cases. Additionally, educational campaigns have been implemented for villagers and school children to emphasize the importance of safely handling of sick or dead poultry.

**India**


Two fatal infections with influenza A(H5N1) virus in a child and in an adult were reported by India during 2025. The child had exposure to poultry, and while no avian influenza outbreaks among poultry were reported in the district where the child lived, neighboring districts had detected poultry outbreaks of avian influenza. Limited information on the adult is available online. No additional human cases were detected by epidemiological investigations of the suspected contacts. Genetic sequencing results indicate that the H5N1 virus belongs to clade 2.3.2.1a, which is one of the viruses circulating in the region.

**Mexico**


One fatal infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus was reported in a child during 2025. The child did not report exposure to infected poultry or other animals. Human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses where animal exposure cannot be identified are uncommon but have occurred. Genetic sequencing results indicated that the influenza A(H5N1) virus associated with this infection was clade 2.3.4.4b, which is circulating in North America and is the same clade that has caused human infections in the United States. Vietnam


One human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus was reported in a child with encephalitis in Vietnam during 2025. The patient had close contact with dead poultry before becoming sick and being hospitalized. Genetic sequencing results of the specimen from the patient was identified as clade 2.3.2.1.e., which is the clade that has been circulating in the region.

**Other Global Cases**

Other countries that have detected human cases of H5N1 bird flu during 2025 include Bangladesh (3 cases), China (1 case), United Kingdom (1 case), and the United States (3 cases).

These cases underscore the need for strong flu systems for influenza response, including robust surveillance and testing, to understand which influenza viruses are circulating and their effect on human health. This is critical for pandemic preparedness and for protecting Americans at home and abroad. Recently recommended pre-pandemic candidate influenza vaccine viruses (CVVs) targeting the clade 2.3.2.1e (A/Cambodia/SVH240441/2024-like CVV) and 2.3.2.1a (A/Victoria/149/2024-like CVV) viruses are currently in development. Based on the close genetic similarity of these two CVVs to clade 2.3.2.1e and 2.3.2.1a viruses detected in humans during 2025, both CVVs are expected to provide good cross-protection against the corresponding clade of influenza A(H5N1) viruses circulating in animal hosts and those detected in humans. Antigenic testing of viruses isolated from some of these cases is pending.

Global Human Cases

CDC continues to provide regular updates on global human cases of H5N1 bird flu.

**The nomenclature of the clade 2.3.2.1c viruses has been updated to better define the Cambodia viruses, now grouped into a clade called 2.3.2.1e.**

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754337675.0,KFF poll shows most Americans plan to skip fall COVID booster,"About two-thirds (59%) of American adults polled in a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation said they had no intention of getting a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine for the upcoming cold and flu season. 

Of the adults polled, 23% said they will “probably not” get the vaccine, while 37% said they will “definitely not” get the shot. Earlier this year the Trump administration and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. made sweeping changes to COVID-19 vaccine policy, with a seasonal booster no longer recommended for children, pregnant women, and adults with no underlying health conditions. 

**Sharp political divide noted**

There was a distinct political divide among poll respondents, with Democrats and Republicans sharply divided on the question of whether Kennedy’s vaccine changes, including his replacement of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory committee members, will make the nation safer. 

“About two in ten adults, including 41% of Republicans, think these changes will make people safer while about one-third of adults, including most Democrats (62%) and four in ten independents (41%) say they will make people less safe,” KFF said. Sixty percent of Republicans said they will not get the COVID-19 vaccine this Fall.

Thirty-one percent of respondents said they did not know if the changes will make the nation safer. And only 49% of poll respondents said they trust the Food and Drug Administration or the CDC to make sure vaccines are safe. 

A less noticeable divide was seen among racial and ethnic groups. Four in 10 Black adults and Hispanic adults say they plan to get the COVID-19 vaccine, as do 37% of white adults.",1mho1s3,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kff-poll-shows-most-americans-plan-skip-fall-covid-booster,60
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754337595.0,"New measles cases reported in Wisconsin, Wyoming, New Jersey","Wisconsin health officials have confirmed the state's first measles cases this year. 

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Oconto County Public Health said in a news release last week that nine people in Oconto County, in the northeastern part of the state, were exposed to a common source of infection during out-of-state travel. One case was confirmed through testing at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, and the other eight cases were confirmed based on exposure and symptoms. No public points of exposure have been identified but investigation continues.

Meanwhile, the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) said last week that it has identified four additional measles cases among adults and children who were exposed to a person with a confirmed measles infection. Three of the additional case-patients were unvaccinated at the time of exposure. WDH said members of the public may have been exposed at a Walmart and a restaurant in Rawlins, Wyoming, on June 29. Wyoming has reported six measles cases so far this year.

In New Jersey, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) last week alerted residents to a new measles case in a resident of Passaic County following international travel. NJDOH officials said individuals who were at the Chilton Medical Center on July 31 and Aug 1 may have been exposed. The case is the state's sixth of 2025.

As of last week's update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 1,333 confirmed measles cases in the United States this year.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1754061552.0,"Childhood Vaccination Rates Have Dropped Again, C.D.C. Data Shows","New federal data shows that vaccination rates among American children entering kindergarten fell during the 2024-25 school year, extending a worrying trend that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The percentage of children granted exemptions from vaccines has also risen sharply over the past decade.
The statistics, released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provide a sobering explanation for the resurgence of childhood diseases across the United States. Measles has sickened more people this year than in any year since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000, in large part because of a multistate outbreak that began in West Texas and has led to three deaths.

“The more these rates continue to drop, the more danger we’re in of seeing outbreaks like we saw in Texas,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease expert in New York City.

The report comes at a time when public health experts are particularly concerned about childhood vaccinations because of increasing skepticism of the shots, including among top health officials. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, has questioned, without scientific basis, the safety of many childhood vaccines, including those for measles, hepatitis B and polio.

In June, a panel of vaccine advisers installed by Mr. Kennedy announced that they would closely scrutinize the immunization schedules for children and adolescents. Mr. Kennedy’s appointees have also restricted access to the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy pregnant women and children.

The messaging from Mr. Kennedy’s office seems “specifically designed to sow distrust in vaccines,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the infectious disease committee for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“The good news is the majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids,” he said. But it is concerning that rates have dropped, he said, “because that really matters in terms of spread of disease.”

In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the federal health department, said the C.D.C. was committed to making vaccines accessible and raising awareness about their efficacy, but also emphasized that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”

Immunization rates for the vaccine that protects against measles had for years held steady at 95 percent, the level needed to stop the disease from spreading in a community. It dipped during the 2020-21 school year to 93.9 percent and has continued to decline each year. In 2024-25, only 92.5 percent of kindergartners had received the shots.

Vaccination rates for polio also fell to 92.5 percent last year from 95 percent at the start of the pandemic.

The percentage changes may seem small, but they represent large numbers. During the last school year, about 286,000 children entered kindergarten without documentation of receiving the two measles shots required for full protection against the disease, according to the C.D.C.

Vaccinations are not evenly spread across the country. There are many vulnerable parts of the country where coverage is far lower than 93 percent, including West Texas, where the large measles outbreak began.

“You can have a city that has a 98 percent vaccination rate but have a community in that city that has a 60 percent rate,” Dr. Ratner said. “I think the fear is that we have more of those now.”

Vaccinations against pertussis, or whooping cough, have also steadily declined since the pandemic, falling to just over 92 percent last year, from 94.9 percent in the 2019-2020 school year.

There were more than 32,000 cases of whooping cough in 2024, the highest tally in a decade. In California alone, the disease struck 2,000 people, including an infant who died, between January and October 2024.

The number of children granted medical exemptions for shots otherwise required to start public school in many states has remained flat over the years. But nonmedical exemptions nationwide have spiked to 3.6 percent in the last school year from 2 percent a decade ago.

Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C., with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding 5 percent, according to the C.D.C.

Disruptions during the pandemic derailed immunizations across the world. But vaccination rates have not recovered since then, as many public health experts had hoped they would.

Globally, vaccination for measles fell to 68 percent during the pandemic. Intensive efforts have improved the coverage somewhat, but by the end of last year, only 76 percent of children worldwide had received two measles shots. [....] 

A 2015 study estimated that before widespread vaccination, measles may have accounted for as many as half of all infectious disease deaths in children.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753970141.0,"She ended up with a bat in her mouth — and $21,000 in medical bills","In retrospect, Erica Kahn realizes she made two big mistakes.

The first was choosing to temporarily forgo health insurance when she was laid off from her job.

The second was screaming when a wild bat later landed on her face.

The bizarre encounter happened last August, while the Massachusetts resident was photographing the night sky during a vacation at the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona. Kahn, now 33, noticed a few bats flying around but didn’t worry about them — until one flew up to her and got tangled between her camera and her face.

She screamed, and part of the bat went into her mouth. She doesn’t know which part or for how long, though she estimates it was for only a few seconds. “It seemed longer,” she said.

The bat flew away, leaving Kahn shaken.

She didn’t think the animal had bitten her. Regardless, her father, who is a physician and was traveling with her, said she should go to a hospital within a day or so and begin vaccinations against rabies.

Figuring she would be covered as long as she obtained insurance before going to the hospital, Kahn said, she found a policy online the day after the bat incident. She said she called the company before she bought its policy and was told services related to an accident or “life-threatening” emergency would be covered.

Kahn went the next day to a hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she started rabies prevention treatment. Over the next two weeks, she received the rest of the rabies shots at clinics in Arizona and Massachusetts and at a hospital in Colorado.

Then the bills came.

[...] 

According to explanation-of-benefits statements, Kahn owed a total of $20,749 for her care at the four facilities. Most of the charges were from the hospital where she was first treated, Flagstaff Medical Center: $17,079, including $15,242 for the rabies and immunoglobulin shots.

Kahn’s policy did not pay for any of the services. “The required waiting period for this service has not been met,” said an explanation-of-benefits letter she received in December.

Kahn was stunned. “I thought it must have been a mistake,” she said. “I guess I was naive.”

When Kahn was laid off from her job as a biomedical engineer last summer, she had the option to temporarily stay on her former employer’s insurance under a COBRA plan, at a cost of about $650 a month. But as a young, healthy person, she gambled that she could get by without insurance until she found another job. She figured that if she needed medical care, she could quickly buy a private policy.

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, those who qualify for COBRA must be given at least 60 days to sign up — and if they do, the coverage applies retroactively. Kahn, who was still within that period at the time of the incident, said recently that she did not realize she had that option.

The policy she purchased after the bat episode, which cost about $311 a month, was from a Florida company called Innovative Partners LP. Documents Kahn provided to KFF Health News say the policy has a 30-day waiting period, which “does not apply to benefits regarding an accident or loss of life.”

Kahn said that after receiving notice that her claims were denied, she called the company to ask how she could appeal and was told a doctor would have to file paperwork. She said she wrote a letter that was signed by a doctor at Flagstaff Medical Center and submitted it in March but was unable to reach doctors at the other facilities.

Kahn said she was given conflicting answers about where to send the paperwork. She said a representative with the company recently told her it had not received any appeals from her.

Benefits statements Kahn received in early July show Innovative Partners had not paid the claims. The company did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said most health coverage plans take effect on the first day of the month after a customer enrolls.

“The insurance companies — for good reason — don’t want people to wait to sign up for coverage until they are sick,” she said, noting the premiums healthy people pay help balance the costs of paying for health care.

[...] 

Shlim, who recently co-wrote a federal advisory about rabies prevention, added that  healthy bats don’t normally fly into people, as the one in this case did. The animal’s entanglement with Kahn suggests it could have been sick, possibly with rabies, he said.

Rabies prevention treatment is much more expensive in the United States than in most other countries, Shlim said. The priciest part is immunoglobulin, which is made from the blood plasma of people who have been vaccinated against rabies.

The treatment is often administered in hospital emergency rooms, which add their own steep charges, Shlim noted.

Kahn said she is employed again and has good health insurance but is still facing most of the bills from her misadventure at Glen Canyon. She said she paid a doctor bill from Flagstaff Medical Center after negotiating it down from $706 to $420. She said she’s also arranged a $10-a-month plan to pay off the $530 she owes for one of her rabies shots at another facility.

She said she plans to continue appealing the denials of payment for the rest of the bills, which total more than $19,000. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753885542.0,"In a first, the Senate confirms a new CDC director","After months weathering staffing cuts and disease outbreaks without an official leader, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally has a new director.

The Senate confirmed Susan Monarez, a health scientist and longtime civil servant, to run the public health agency. She is the first CDC director to be confirmed by the Senate under a law passed in 2023, and the first to serve in the role without a medical degree in more than 70 years. The vote was 51-47, along party lines.

Monarez takes over an agency in chaos, according to employees who have spoken to NPR. Thousands of workers have left in recent months and support for many programs has been cut. President Trump has proposed slashing CDC's funding for fiscal year 2026.

""We really need her in this role,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health, who has known Monarez professionally for more than a decade. ""She's a loyal, hardworking civil servant who leads with evidence and pragmatism, and has been dedicated to improving the health of Americans for the entirety of her career.""

Monarez, a microbiologist and immunologist by training, served as CDC's acting director from January through March this year, stepping down as required when Trump chose her for the director role. Previously, she was deputy director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, a governmental agency that funds cutting-edge biomedical and health research.

[...] 

In the hearing, Monarez walked a fine line between traditional public health perspectives and those of her boss, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned the safety of vaccines. He now oversees federal health agencies that include CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.

In response to a question from Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Delaware Democrat, about whether she would commit to keeping routine vaccines free for U.S. children, Monarez said, ""Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I will commit to making sure that we continue to prioritize vaccine availability.""

Monarez also said she believes fluoride is an important component to oral health, and that the fluoridated tap water in her community is safe. For decades, low levels of fluoride have been added to many community drinking water systems to prevent cavities, though Health Secretary Kennedy has directed the CDC to change its guidance on the practice, alleging health harms that have not been found at the recommended fluoride levels.

At the hearing, Monarez repeatedly defended the Trump administration's vision for the CDC, which she described as ""getting back to its core mission of preventing, detecting and responding to infectious diseases and emerging threats."" She said programs that focus on other health issues that she described as ""important public health concerns,"" such as chronic diseases, obesity, depression, drug addiction and overdose, would be transitioned to other parts of HHS. Kennedy has announced that he is creating a new Administration for a Healthy America, which may focus on primary care, mental health, environmental health and more. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753794047.0,Covid-19 wimpy wave is here (via YLE),"[...] Here’s what you need to know for your health this Monday.

The summer Covid-19 wave has arrived, though so far, it’s been relatively wimpy. Wastewater signals, emergency department visits, and test positivity rates are all gradually increasing, but not yet reaching the levels we saw at this time last year. Hawaii and Florida are notable exceptions, with more significant activity. Hospitalizations and deaths remain low due to broad population immunity, though—as always—severe outcomes tend to lag behind other indicators. Currently, Covid-19 is causing about 100 deaths per week in the U.S.

Can we still trust wastewater data? Yes! The U.S. wastewater surveillance system—anchored by the CDC and spanning 1,400+ sites—remains funded through FY2025. And it’s evolving, as many local systems are now also tracking measles, opioids, and more.

For the data nerds: While wastewater is an important signal for Covid-19, I’m currently relying more on ED visits and test positivity. That’s because there’s no standardized wastewater baseline. Instead, some states compare to their own previous 12-month levels. But with unusually low Covid levels over the past year, even small increases can look artificially large right now and that is throwing a lot of states off.

If you’re feeling sick: Even with Covid-19 increasing, odds are it’s not Covid. Most positive respiratory tests right now are still coming back as the common cold.

Norovirus rates—think vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid spread—continue to linger after an unusually intense year thanks to a new variant. Currently, levels are still elevated compared to previous years, but are trending downward.

What to do: Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water—sanitizer doesn’t kill norovirus. Be extra cautious if it’s going around your kid’s summer camp or your friend group.

A recent norovirus outbreak in Utah was linked to frozen oysters, serving as a reminder that norovirus can spread rapidly through contaminated food and surfaces. (Note: The same oysters were sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. If you’re here, pass on the frozen oysters for now.)

**Good news**

This is the first week with no new reported measles cases linked to the Southwestern U.S. outbreak (Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas). If that trend continues for a few more weeks, it will signal that the outbreak has been contained. That’s a big deal for young families in these communities who have faced weeks of worry and disruption. It also helps protect the U.S.’s WHO measles elimination status, which is jeopardized if an outbreak lasts 12 months or more.

The Covid vaccine saved 2.5 million lives between 2020-2024 according to a new global study. The biggest benefits were for older populations: 9 out of 10 deaths prevented were among those aged 60 and above. Other researchers have found even larger effects, estimating that vaccines have saved more than 18 million lives in Europe and 3 million in the United States.

Flu vaccines also averted 33% to 42% of U.S. cases across 2022-2023, even though uptake was comparatively low.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753712217.0,Avian Flu Wiped Out Poultry. Now the Screwworm Is Coming for Beef.,"First came bird flu, which led to the culling of large swaths of the nation’s poultry flocks and the soaring egg prices that helped undermine President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s re-election. Now, ranchers in Texas and officials at the Agriculture Department are raising the next alarm: the New World screwworm.

Texas livestock producers and ranchers fear the United States is ill-equipped to handle a potential outbreak of screwworm, whose incursion into the country appears increasingly likely. With beef prices already soaring, the screwworm, whose Latin name roughly translates to “man-eater,” is a real threat, to both cows and the cost of living for America’s meat lovers.

“If we wait, we lose,” Stephen Diebel, vice president of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, told state lawmakers during a hearing in Austin this week as he pleaded for intervention.
The screwworm, like the measles, may have been forgotten by many, but it’s not new. And like the measles, which has cropped up in Texas recently, screwworm was once all but eradicated from the United States.

Infestations occur when a female fly lays eggs, between 10 and 400 at a time, on a fresh animal wound. Within a few hours, the eggs hatch into larvae that burrow and feed on the flesh. As the wound worsens, it attracts more flies, which lay more eggs. After about a week, adult screwworm flies can reproduce and begin the cycle all over again. The parasitic infection can kill a cow within two weeks if left untreated. There is currently no approved treatment.

“It’s like something out of a horror movie,” the Texas agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, said in an interview. He saw distressed cattle infested with screwworm when he was a child in the early 1960s before it was nearly eradicated. “It’s quite a putrid sight,” he said.

Livestock, wildlife, pets and in rare cases, humans, can be affected.

In the 1950s, scientists discovered that radiation effectively sterilizes screwworm flies, and the federal government began an eradication program. A small outbreak in a deer population in the Florida Keys was snuffed out in 2017. 

Now, a potentially bigger threat is approaching, migrating north from South America, where screwworm is endemic. It has been detected as close as 370 miles from Texas’ border, carried by the surge of animals coming through the Darién Gap, a once largely impenetrable jungle area that separates South and Central America. A joint eradication effort between the United States and Panama has largely kept screwworm south of Central America for decades. Illegal livestock transport and warm weather patterns have also contributed to the worm’s climb north, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department said.

“For small herds, it could wipe us out,” said Shelbie Pippenger, who, with her husband, has a small herd in Texas and helps manage other ranches. “Once something starts, it’s difficult to stop it.”

The agriculture secretary, Brooke Collins, announced in June an $8.5 million initiative based in Texas that will produce sterile male screwworm flies and then drop them into affected areas. Female flies mate only once in their lifetime, so the sterile flies eventually overwhelm and eradicate the pest.

Ms. Collins also committed $21 million to renovate a fly production facility in Mexico, where 60 million to 100 million sterile male flies would be produced each week for use in Mexico or Texas by the end of the year.

But that effort would yield only about 20 percent of the sterile flies the United States would need to manage an outbreak, experts said. Around 600 million flies were released each week to eradicate screwworm decades ago. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, introduced legislation that would provide $300 million to construct a facility to breed and sterilize flies, but the House has left Washington for the summer.

“We are desperately short on sterile fly production,” Mr. Diebel said.

[...] 

Cattle farmers are urging Texas lawmakers, who on Monday gaveled in a 30-day special legislative session, to share the cost of a fly factory in Texas, instead of waiting for the federal government.

“When it came to border security, Texas decided not to wait on Washington to act,” Charles Maley of the South Texans’ Property Rights Association said during last week’s hearing. “With New World screwworm, this state can do the same thing.”

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas did not respond to questions about whether he would approve state funding for a fly factory. The governor has directed the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Animal Health Commission to create a response team to lead the state’s screwworm preparations.

Meanwhile, based on how fast the screwworm is traveling, Mr. Miller said it could reach Texas within four months.

In economic terms, the screwworm is already here, modestly at least. About three percent of U.S. cattle come from Mexico, but citing inadequate surveillance of screwworm, the Agriculture Department cut off imports of Mexican cattle in November. Federal officials resumed the trade in February after Mexico put in place more rigorous inspection protocols. But imports were shut off again in May after the pest was detected in Veracruz and Oaxaca.

""Every 30 seconds, someone dies from a hepatitis-related severe liver disease or liver cancer. Yet we have the tools to stop hepatitis,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.

Viral hepatitis – types A, B, C, D, and E – are major causes of acute liver infection. Among these only hepatitis B, C, and D can lead to chronic infections that significantly increase the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Yet most people with hepatitis don’t know they’re infected. Types B, C, and D affect over 300 million people globally and cause more than 1.3 million deaths each year, mainly from liver cirrhosis and cancer.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently classified hepatitis D as carcinogenic to humans, just like hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis D, which only affects individuals infected with the hepatitis B, is associated with a two- to six-fold higher risk of liver cancer compared to hepatitis B alone. This reclassification marks a critical step in global efforts to raise awareness, improve screening, and expand access to new treatments for hepatitis D.

“WHO has published guidelines on testing and diagnosis of Hepatitis B and D in 2024, and is actively following the clinical outcomes from innovative treatments for hepatitis D,” said Dr Meg Doherty, incoming Director of Science for Health at WHO.

Treatment with oral medicine can cure hepatitis C within 2 to 3 months and effectively suppress hepatitis B with life-long therapy. Treatment options for hepatitis D are evolving. However, the full benefit of reducing liver cirrhosis and cancer deaths can only be realized through urgent action to scale up and integrate hepatitis services – including vaccination, testing, harm reduction, and treatment – into national health systems.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753367310.0,New study advances theory on why most U.S. bird flu cases have so far been mild,"[...] A new study published Wednesday adds weight to an argument that the immunity people have developed to the virus that caused the most recent flu pandemic, an H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009, has induced some cross-protection that may be making it harder for H5N1 to infect people, and mitigating the severity of the ensuing disease when such infections occur.

The paper, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, reports on a number of studies done in ferrets, the closest animal model for what happens when humans are infected with influenza. It showed that while H5N1 is lethal to ferrets with no immunity to influenza, animals that have previously been infected with influenza A — either H3N2 or H1N1 — appear to have some protection when they are later exposed to the bird flu virus. The protection is particularly strong with H1N1.
Seema Lakdawala, one of the authors of the study, said the findings provide hope that, should H5N1 — long considered a major pandemic threat — acquire the ability to spread easily to and among humans, the resulting pandemic might not be as disastrous as people have feared.

“Hopefully, most people will not die when they come into contact with the virus because they have some prior H1 immunity from infection or an H3N2 immunity from infection,” Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology and co-director of Emory University’s Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens, told STAT in an interview. 

Traditionally influenza research in ferrets has been done in naive animals — those that have never been exposed to flu viruses. But increasingly scientists are using animals that have experienced previous flu infections, because they more closely resemble what might happen with humans during infection. People experience numerous exposures to flu viruses — or flu vaccines — over the course of a lifetime, building up an array of immune defenses to the ubiquitous viruses. But flu viruses evolve constantly, acquiring the ability to evade human immunity in the process.
In this study, which was done primarily by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University, blood from ferrets that had recovered from infection with one type of flu virus — H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B — was studied to see if the animals had developed antibodies that would react to and potentially protect against H5N1 viruses. 

Later, animals were sequentially infected with various combinations of two of the three types of viruses, to see if some combinations developed more robust immunity to H5N1 than others. Influenza B viruses appeared to offer no protection, but ferrets infected with the two influenza A viruses fared better against H5N1, which is also a flu A virus.

One of the surface proteins of H1N1, the neuraminidase or N in its name, bears some similarities to the neuraminidase carried by H5N1 viruses, leading some experts to theorize that it might offer some cross-protection. [...] 

Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of that paper, said the new research and other recent studies support the idea that previous infection with H1N1 induces some protection against H5N1. But this study cannot determine what the mechanism for that protection is, he noted. More research on this is needed, Peiris said.

Troy Sutton, one of the senior authors of the new paper, agreed.

“I can’t say to you ‘This is the protein. This is the magic one,’” Sutton, a virologist and associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State, said in an interview. “When you get infected with a flu virus, there are multiple immune mechanisms involved in clearing that virus.”

While all of the experts who spoke with STAT about the paper described the research in glowing terms, not everyone is convinced human immunity to the seasonal flu virus H1N1 explains the relative lack of severe disease in the H5N1 infections in the U.S. over the past year and a half, as the virus has moved through dairy cattle and poultry operations in multiple parts of the country.

Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a leading influenza scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is among those who are skeptical, pointing to H5N1 infections in Cambodia, which has reported 27 cases since 2023, 12 of which have been fatal. The version of the virus circulating in that country is different from the one that has been infecting cows and poultry in the United States.

Kawaoka believes a number of other factors may explain differences in the severity of cases, including differences in the viruses, the way dairy workers and poultry cullers are being infected — often, it seems, with virus entering their eyes — or the ages and underlying health of the people who are being infected.

Richard Webby, a flu expert who heads the World Health Organization’s collaborating center on influenza in animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, shares Kawaoka’s views.
“I don’t want to downplay the study because it’s an important study. But it’s just explaining a part of the puzzle. It’s absolutely not explaining everything we’re seeing,” he said.

“We know that seasonal influenza viruses transmit just fine in the human population where there is a lot of preexisting immunity. So preexisting immunity in its own right is not enough to prevent an influenza virus from transmitting through the population.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753276201.0,‘She could have died.’ Alberta mother feared the worst for 4-month-old with measles,"Months after fearing she would lose her baby girl to measles, Morgan Birch says she wants Canadians to educate themselves more about the importance of vaccines.

Birch’s daughter, Kimie Fukuta-Birch, was too young to be eligible for the vaccine, which is not routinely given to children under a year old. But she feels her baby would not have been infected if more people around her had received the vaccine.

“Basically as parents it’s your responsibility to educate yourself with the help of your pediatrician and health-care professionals,” she said. “I feel this was completely preventable.”

Birch, who lives in Fort Saskatchewan, Alta., said she is also worried that her daughter may suffer long-term health complications as a result of her getting measles at such a young age.

“It’s not just that parent or child who it affected when they don’t vaccinate, there’s a whole other population that needs to be protected by vaccines.”

Birch isn’t certain where her daughter got infected, but said she took her out in the Fort Saskatchewan community before she got sick.

Alberta has become a hot spot for measles, with the province reporting nearly 1,380 infections since the beginning of March.

This is more than the total number of cases reported in the United States.

Ontario has also reported more than 2,270 infections since an outbreak began last fall.

Alberta’s immunization rates against measles for children fall below the recommended rate of 95 per cent that scientists say is needed to prevent the illness from spreading.

The province’s 2024 data shows that by age two, 80 per cent of children received one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, and 68 per cent received both doses. Alberta’s vaccination schedule for the two-part shot calls for the first dose at 12 months and the second at 18 months.

But even by age seven, only 71.6 per cent had received both doses, provincial data shows.

However, it’s not the only province with low immunization rates against measles among children. Three out of the four Atlantic provinces told The Canadian Press they also had immunization rates below the 95-per-cent threshold, while one province, Newfoundland and Labrador, has not responded to requests for its data.

Last week, Dr. Kimberley Barker, regional medical officer of health for Sussex, N.B., said measles cases were rising due to factors such as vaccine hesitancy.

In some cases, she said parents are too busy and may underestimate the seriousness or risk of infection.

Barker said officials are ramping up immunization campaigns when schools start in September to make it easier for kids with busy parents to get vaccinated.

Other provinces are also making it easier to get immunized through walk-in clinics, community health centres and health-care providers.

Birch explained how the consequences could be severe for those who don’t follow recommendations from their local public health officials and doctors.

She recalled that before her daughter’s bout of measles, she was a happy baby.

But it took a month for Kimie to recover from the infection.

And although she is now back to her “happy self,” Birch said she seems to be falling sick more than she used to.

“Her immune system has to be built up again.”

Overall, Canada has a total of 3,822 confirmed measles cases from Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, as of July 5.

New Brunswick has confirmed 14 cases.

Shelly Bolotin, director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto, said the first does of the measles vaccine is usually given at 12 months. But children as young as six months can also be given the shot if they are travelling or living in an area with an outbreak.

Although, she added those children who receive a dose at six months will still need to receive two subsequent doses.

“As people are going out of town and taking trips — if they are going to measles endemic areas — they can protect their infant if they’re a minimum of six months old,” Bolotin said, adding it takes up to two weeks for the vaccination to take effect.

Bolotin said the incubation period for measles is up to three weeks from the time a person is exposed to the disease until they start experiencing symptoms.

Measles infects the immune cells, erasing a lot of the previous immunity and leaving the person susceptible to other bacterial and viral infections for several years, she said.

[...] 

After recovering from a bout of infection, Banerji said some children have temporary low immunity. “It can take a while to recover,” she said.

Meanwhile, Birch said she will carry the heartbreak, frustration and feeling of helplessness as she watched her four-month-old daughter fight measles.

“She could have died,” she said of her daughter. “A lot of kids died from measles back before there were preventive measures in place.”",1m78uhk,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/she-could-have-died-alberta-mother-feared-the-worst-for-4-month-old-with-measles/,295

Health officials also warned that people may have been exposed at an Albuquerque Amusement park last week during the following times and date:

11 a.m. – 8 p.m. on Thursday, July 17 at Cliff’s Amusement Park at 4800 Osuna Road NW.
Santa Fe makes the ninth county with identified measles cases, joining Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy, Lea, Luna, San Juan and Sandoval counties.

New Mexico Department of Health officials urged any people recently at the location to check their vaccination statuses and report any symptoms that develop in the next three weeks to health care providers.

Health care providers say the vaccine is the only effective prevention against the spread of the highly contagious respiratory virus. Measles symptoms can develop between one to three weeks from exposure and include fever, cough, red eyes and a spotted red rash usually spreading across the face and across the body.

**Since July 2024, Nassau County has confirmed 25 rabid animals, including raccoons and feral cats, across multiple communities, health officials say.**

 They note the cases mark a ""significant resurgence"" of rabies, which had previously been eradicated in Nassau County in 2016 following aggressive control efforts.

Current surveillance data shows that the virus is now circulating in the county.

Health officials say they'll continue their already in place Raccoon Rabies Control Program this fall as part of a comprehensive effort to mitigate the spread. Rabies is a viral disease spread to humans and pets primarily through bites, scratches, or salivary contact to open wounds, eyes, nose, or mouth, from an infected animal.

To protect yourself from possible exposure to rabies, health officials suggest the following:

Do not feed or touch wild animals, stray cats, or dogs, and discourage them from seeking food near your home.

Ensure pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations, including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, and livestock. Pets too young to be vaccinated should be kept indoors and allowed outside only under direct observation.

Keep family pets indoors at night. Do not leave them outside unattended or let them roam free. Advise your family against approaching any unknown animal – wild or domestic – especially those acting abnormally.

If a wild animal is on your property, immediately bring children and pets indoors and let it wander away. You may contact a nuisance wildlife control expert who will remove the animal for a fee.

Do not touch dying or dead animals. If you must move them, use a shovel, wear heavy rubber gloves, double bag the carcass, and place it in your outdoor trash can.

Any individual bitten or scratched by an animal should seek medical care and then call health officials at 516-227-9663. No human cases of rabies have been reported in Nassau County to date due to the availability and effectiveness of immediate post-exposure prophylaxis treatment.",1m6f2m6,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/long-island/rabies-alert-nassau-county-public-health-threat-ncdoh/6342872/,78

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753133949.0,Prominent US anti-vaxxer says he caught measles and traveled back home,"One of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the US says he caught measles in west Texas and traveled back home – but he seems not to have alerted local authorities of his illness, which means the highly transmissible virus may have spread onward.

Measles is a threat to people who are unvaccinated or immune-compromised. In anti-vaccine communities, it may quickly find a foothold and spread largely under the radar before ballooning into an outbreak.

Brian Hooker, chief scientific officer of Children’s Health Defense, filmed an interview in west Texas in March with the parents of the six-year-old child who died from measles – the first measles death in the US in a decade.

The video promoted several dangerous myths about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, a virus that can be deadly and can cause lifelong harm.

Hooker and Polly Tommey, an anti-vaccine film-maker with Children’s Health Defense, also interviewed other Mennonite families in west Texas. And they visited the medical office of Ben Edwards while patients and Edwards himself had symptomatic measles, they said.

Hooker then traveled home to Redding, California, and developed measles symptoms, he said.

“Full disclosure, 18 days after visiting Seminole, Texas, sitting in a measles clinic and being exposed to Doctor Ben with the measles, I got the measles. So cool,” Hooker said.

Hooker, Tommey, and Edwards spoke on a podcast hosted by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch on May 22. This news has not been previously reported by other outlets. Children’s Health Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiry for this story.

Hooker doesn’t appear to have sought healthcare or testing to confirm his symptoms were measles and not another infection. Other viral and bacterial infections may cause rashes, which is why medical providers need to conduct tests to confirm measles cases.

Without confirmation of his illness being measles, Hooker may spread misinformation about the illness – including what helps to treat it.

Hooker says he turned to the alternative treatments hailed by anti-vaccine activists. Edwards had given him cod liver oil and vitamin C supplements in Gaines county, Hooker said, noting: “I stuck them in my luggage, and that’s what I did.”

And if this case was measles, by not seeking confirmation testing and notifying officials, Hooker may have contributed to onward spread.

It’s not clear if his first symptoms appeared after 18 days, or if he developed other symptoms – runny nose, cough, fever, watery eyes – and then a rash after 18 days.

After a person is exposed to measles, the virus usually incubates for 11 to 12 days before respiratory symptoms appear, followed by a rash two to four days later. A person is considered infectious four days before the rash appears and remains infectious until four days after it fades.

If Hooker’s illness was measles, “it sounds like my worst nightmare as an infectious disease doc,” said Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at University of California San Francisco. “For all we know, there’s a trail of measles, like bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel.”

In areas with no known cases, health providers might not immediately suspect measles, he said: “Many people probably didn’t know they had it. There could have been people who were ill with pneumonia, who went into the hospital and no one diagnosed it. It’s very, very hard to diagnose because we haven’t seen that much of it. But of course, we’re seeing a lot more of it now.”

There are other indications that the actual number of cases from the Texas outbreak is higher than the official count, Chin-Hong said – with three confirmed deaths, experts might expect a case count closer to 3,000, instead of the 762 cases in Texas and 95 cases in New Mexico.

Typically, medical providers alert local or state health officials when a patient tests positive for measles. Health officials then conduct contact tracing to notify anyone who came into contact with the patient, including other travelers.

A representative for the Shasta county health department, serving the area where Hooker says he lives, said there have been no confirmed cases of measles reported this year. 

“There are no cases of measles in Shasta county, and we have had no notice of any confirmed cases of measles this year,” said Jules Howard, community education specialist with the Shasta County Health & Human Services Agency.

It’s important to know when a region has even a single case so resources can be diverted to the area to stop transmission, Chin-Hong said.

The most important part of those efforts is contact tracing and vaccinating anyone who is vulnerable – especially infants, pregnant people, and immune-compromised people, he said.

Hooker is a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine community. He testified on Tuesday before a US Senate committee in its first-ever “vaccine injury” hearing, attempting to link MMR vaccination to autism – despite several studies showing no relationship.

Hooker said he became sick with measles despite being vaccinated as a child. But because he was born before 1989, he probably only received one dose of the MMR vaccine, which is 93% effective at stopping illness. Vaccination may also make breakthrough illness milder.

When anti-vaccine messages keep parents from getting their children vaccinated, “I think the damage is immediate,” Chin-Hong said, before adding that it “goes beyond the measles outbreak”.

Other vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough and the flu are also surging.

“Measles is like the poster child, but it’s about a way of life that we’ve taken for granted in the last few decades that is threatened,” Chin-Hong said. “The fact that [they] are questioning it on a public stage means that a lot more people who might have trusted their clinicians are questioning it more now.”

The US eliminated measles in 2000, but the nation could lose that status if there is sustained transmission for more than a year.

“We’re going back in time,” Chin-Hong said. “We have to relearn all of these diseases.”",1m5vvjv,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/21/anti-vaxxer-measles-texas,845
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753185076.0,China Reports 2 H9N2 Cases & WHO Clarifies Report On Indian H5N1 Case,"It's no secret that China tends to be cryptic in their public descriptions of avian flu cases, often only providing an onset date, the patients age and gender, and the province where it occurred.  

Additional details on the patient's outcome, or exposures, are often only later revealed in the WHO's WHO: Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface Summary and Assessment, and those are often scant. 

Today's report from Hong Kong's CHP on two recent (albeit from May & June) H9N2 cases on the Mainland (see above) provides even less information than usual as ages and genders are not included. 

Typically, H9N2 presents as a mild infection, and is most often reported in children. For reasons that aren't clear, female cases have outnumber males by a considerable margin (cite).

But over the past 6 months 31% (5 of 16) cases reported by China (with ages provided) have been in adults. At least 4 were reported as hospitalized, 2 with severe illness.  

So the sudden and unexplained replacement of age and gender data with `an individual' in this CHP report is disappointing, as these metrics are among the few we have to track whether H9N2's behavior is changing. 

It is not an idle concern, as the H9N2 virus continues to evolve, and diversify. The CDC has designated 2 different lineages (A(H9N2) G1 and A(H9N2) Y280) as having some pandemic potential (see CDC IRAT SCORE), and several candidate vaccines have been developed.

H9N2 also easily reassorts with, and often enhances, other novel influenza viruses (including H7N9, H5N1, and H5N6), making it an important viral co-conspirator (see Vet. Sci.: The Multifaceted Zoonotic Risk of H9N2 Avian Influenza).

Despite decades of mandated use of vaccines, H9N2 remains poorly controlled in Chinese poultry (see J. Virus Erad.: Ineffective Control Of LPAI H9N2 By Inactivated Poultry Vaccines - China), which has led to the creation and spread of numerous  genotypes.

While I hope these reporting changes are temporary, as we've discussed often over the past couple of years (see here, here, here, and here), the sharing of emerging disease information has deteriorated badly around the world since 2020. 

We've also a clarification on a report last week from the WHO on a fatal H5N1 case in India from last May.  The original report read:

>A human infection with an H5 clade 2.3.2.1a A(H5N1) virus was detected in a sample collected from a man in Khulna state in May 2025, who subsequently died. Genetic sequence data are available in GISAID (EPI_ISL_19893416; submission date 4 June 2025; ICMR-National Institute of Virology; Influenza).

As I pointed out last week, Khulna is not a state in India, but it is a region in Bangladesh (where two recent H5 cases were previously reported).  

Today the WHO's SERO Epi bulletin (14th edition 2025) has a brief update (see below) indicating this case originated from Karnataka State, in the southwestern part of India.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1753117203.0,"COVID-19 cases are rising in these states amid summer wave, CDC data shows","The summer surge of COVID-19 is here, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing increases across much of the country.

In its latest report, the CDC said the number of cases is now growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C. COVID-related emergency room visits for young kids are also the highest they've been since March, according to the data.

CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook told ""CBS Mornings"" Monday this is typical of what we've come to understand about summer spikes in cases.

""We now know that there's a winter spike and then there's a summer spike,"" he said. ""And every year, I just looked last night, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that's the good news.""

But, people shouldn't ignore the increases, he added.

""If it strikes you, especially for the vulnerable, and we're talking about very young children under age of 4, the elderly, people who are immunocompromised — there are millions of people who are immunocompromised out there — they can really get sick,"" LaPook said. 

New COVID variants Nimbus and Stratus
The latest COVID variants, named Nimbus and Stratus, are ""no more deadly"" than previous variants, LaPook said. 

Data on previous variants, like NB.1.8.1 from earlier this year, for example, also did not show more severe illness compared to previous variants. Symptoms were broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, too, including respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.

""The vaccines that were made for this season do cover the current variants, so that's good news,"" LaPook said. ""I think the bottom line here is: Don't be blasé. It's the summer, people have all sorts of things. Be careful.""

Should I get a COVID vaccine booster? 
While the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect you from ""severe illness, hospitalization and death,"" there have been some shifts in recommendations. 

LaPook admits we're in a bit of an odd period right now because the CDC has different vaccine recommendations than many of the major health organizations and societies.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, says pregnant people should get vaccinated.

""Because the baby ... before they can get a shot, they're really relying on the mother's immunity — the mother has the antibodies, goes through the placenta, and then the baby has some protection,"" LaPook explained. 

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""said it's now shared decision making,"" LaPook said. ""So that means that go talk to your clinician about it, which is always a good idea, but it's a little bit of a different recommendation than just saying, 'go get it.'""

The CDC also now recommends ""shared clinical decision-making"" for giving healthy children the COVID-19 vaccine. While the agency currently recommends most adults aged 18 and older get a 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, it says it's especially important if you're 65 and older, at high risk for severe COVID-19 or have never received a COVID-19 shot.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752925070.0,Health experts raise alarm over RFK Jr’s ‘war on science’ amid mass firings and budget cuts,"The Trump administration’s “war on science” appears to have entered a new phase in the aftermath of a recent supreme court decision that empowered health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a prominent vaccine sceptic, and other agency leaders, to implement mass firings – effectively greenlighting the politicization of science.

The decision comes as Kennedy abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting of a key health care advisory panel, the US Preventive Services Task Force, earlier this month. That, combined with his recent removal of a panel of more than a dozen vaccine advisers, signals that his dismantling of the science-based policymaking at HHS is likely far from over.

“The current administration is waging a war on science,” warned Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease expert at New York University in a keynote talk in May to graduates of Harvard’s School of Public Health.

“Today we see rising threats to the public health institutions that have kept our world safe for generations,” she said, citing “cuts to research that benefits the lives of millions, looming public health emergencies that are not being addressed with the urgency they demand, and a continued coordinated attack on the very idea of the scientific process.”

Gounder added: “Over the past few months, we have seen the Trump administration engage not only in medical misinformation, but in active censorship of scientific discourse.”

Since he took the helm at HHS, Kennedy’s unscientific views on vaccines and some other medical matters coupled with the agency’s widespread research and staff cuts, have prompted protests from scientists inside and outside HHS plus lawsuits.

Medical experts say Kennedy’s policies are helping “sow distrust in vaccines” as measles cases soar to a more than three decade high, hurt vital healthcare research with draconian cuts, and helped foment a Trump administration “war on science” mentality.

Kennedy sparked a firestorm in June by ousting 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and votes to provide updates to its vaccine schedule. He then named a new eight person vaccine panel – half of whom share Kennedy’s distrust of vaccines – who quickly retracted recommendations for flu vaccines containing an ingredient which many anti-vaxxers have falsely connected to autism.

That move sparked sharp criticism from veteran doctors with a national pediatric group, which opted to boycott its first meeting.

“Among the reasons we decided not to participate was because it clearly appeared to be an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” Sean O’Leary who chairs a committee on infectious diseases with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Guardian.

Dissent has also spread at the National Institutes of Health, where dozens of science researchers and other staff in June released a detailed document, dubbed the Bethesda Declaration, warning that key missions of the premiere research agency at HHS were being damaged by the Trump administration’s budget cutting.

Even before these moves, prominent healthcare scholars were sounding loud alarms about some HHS policies and the administration’s anti-science mentality – including its draconian budget cuts for research and staff cuts totaling over 10,000.

Gounder said there has been a “flood of Orwellian doublespeak from public health agencies”, contributing to declining vaccination rates and making Americans more susceptible to diseases like measles, which recently hit a level not seen since 2000 when measles was declared eliminated in the US.

Her critique has been amplified by public protests from healthcare experts troubled by its vaccine policies and large cuts to research and staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the NIH and other parts of HHS.

On a separate legal front, a Rhode Island federal court in July ruled against HHS and Kennedy and put a temporary stop to the drastic revamping of HHS and some of its staff cuts.

The ruling provided a court victory to a group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia, which in May sued Kennedy – plus other HHS leaders such as the FDA commissioner and the CDC’s acting director – attacking the restructuring as an “unconstitutional and illegal dismantling” of the agency. Kennedy, they alleged, has “systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job”.

The Rhode Island judge wrote that as members of the executive branch, Kennedy and the HHS do “not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress”.

For his part, Kennedy in March issued a statement defending the early HHS move to cut 10,000 full-time jobs: “We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”

Those jobs have since been cut, as of Monday 14 July, after an 8 July order from the supreme court that allowed the restructuring plans to proceed. [...] 

O’Leary and many other medical experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences.

“What we’re seeing across HHS is deeply concerning,” said O’Leary “NIH funding has never been politically or ideologically driven, but clearly that’s what we’re seeing now. Those cuts are going to have serious consequences for our country and healthcare.”",1m3u3j5,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/19/rfk-jr-science-research-cuts,300
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752879233.0,Behind the Scenes of Ontario’s Mennonite Measles Outbreak,"When I was 10, my family and I left our Mennonite community in Mexico and moved to Ontario. I didn’t understand any English when we first arrived—I only spoke Low German—and while I picked the language up over time, not everyone in my family did. A few years later, my grandmother entered a nursing home for dementia, and I spent a lot of time taking care of her. After she passed away, I decided to pursue a career that would help Low German speakers like her access health care. 

For the last six years now, I’ve been a personal support worker at the St. Thomas Central Community Health Centre in southwestern Ontario. With the help of a nurse practitioner, I run a mobile clinic that provides a variety of health-care services—including immunizations and pre-natal care—to the local community, which is primarily made up of Low German–speaking Mennonites. When measles cases started popping up early this year, I wasn’t particularly surprised. I knew that many members of our community hadn’t been vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. I knew how taboo it was: my family was vaccinated when I was young, but others looked down upon us for that choice. 

Five months later, around 150 to 200 of our clients have had measles, and most of our Low German–speaking clients have at least had symptoms. To fight this ongoing outbreak, it’s important to understand why it came about in the first place. 

Our ancestors came from Europe, and when they settled in Canada, they negotiated a number of promises with the Canadian government—including educational independence. When some provinces later passed laws requiring Mennonite children to attend public schools, many families, wanting to hold tight to their religious and cultural identity, emigrated to South America. In the past few decades, there’s been a wave of immigration back to Canada, and many returning families don’t speak any English. 

With that history and language barrier comes a level of distrust toward anything they classify as being part of the “system.” They often do their own research to corroborate what they hear from authorities. Unfortunately, that leads to many problematic misconceptions about immunization. Religious convictions have also been a developing concern, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many community members feel that getting immunized weakens their faith, since it’s a sign that they trust in modern medicine more than God.

When it comes to measles in particular, most families just don’t understand the seriousness of the condition. They think that, like chicken pox, contracting it will create immunity. They don’t know that measles could lead to other illnesses and be particularly harmful for children, whose developing bodies are more vulnerable to the infection and its complications.

In February, a Low German–speaking Mennonite mother visited the mobile health clinic where I work. She was there to get care for her five-year-old daughter, who had been sick on and off for weeks. The two of them had tried to get vaccinated for measles multiple times, but each time they did, the daughter had fallen ill just before they were meant to go. We suspected she might have measles but couldn’t see signs of the most common symptoms, and so we addressed what we could see and treated her for an ear infection. Only a few hours later, she developed a measles rash. The following morning, the mother called me: her child was coughing so violently she was vomiting. I told her to go to the hospital. Later, she called me again, upset. She said that when she got to the ER, they’d told her to go home. 

I couldn’t help but think something was off. The hospital doesn’t turn people away, I told her, but she insisted that they had. So I called them directly to figure out what had happened. It turned out there had been a miscommunication. Hospital staff had told her not to come in, using a “stop” hand gesture to communicate, and she had become so flustered that she failed to catch the second part of the message: that she should wait in the car while they prepared a negative-pressure room. 

Once I had explained what happened, she felt a little silly for not calling me while she was still there. She took her daughter back to the hospital, where the child was admitted and treated. Though the mother ended up contracting measles as well, they both later got immunized. 

In late April, we got a call from the ER: one of our clients had been there with her baby, who was sick with measles and pneumonia. That family had missed their regular December checkup, so we hadn’t seen them for a while—some families only come in when they think there’s a problem. (This is often an attitude that they bring with them from Mexico, where health care is expensive and often hard to access.) This family in particular had also been one of the most opposed to immunization. 

A few days after they landed in the ER, they left to have their baby treated in London, Ontario. There, the hospital put her on antibiotics, IV fluids and oxygen because she wasn’t breathing very well. The baby eventually recovered, but despite witnessing the risk firsthand, the family refused to get vaccinated. They were afraid the baby was too young and wanted to wait. We respected their decision and explained how they could avoid spreading the disease and prevent their child from contracting it again. They’ve been receptive and have done their best to attend their regular checkups with us.

Building that kind of trust with the Mennonite community is how we’ve been able to mitigate the impact of the outbreak. Bridging the language gap is an important part of that—the most important part of my job is accurately and accessibly explaining a patient’s condition to them. Since Low German is a colloquial language, it lacks the medical terminology for direct translation from English. Instead, I explain conditions and processes in common words, making sure to limit discrepancies between what I say and what the clinic’s nurse practitioner says. All the while, we present ourselves as a neutral source of information and avoid telling anyone they have to do anything. 

We go the extra mile to accommodate every patient. If they prefer natural remedies to medication, we try to find a solution that works for them before we prescribe anything. I’ll often accompany patients to their specialist appointments to help translate since I know all their medical information. All these efforts help show our clients that we are there for them. 

This work has gone a long way. Clients come to us asking about measles and vaccinations after hearing about the severity of cases from their friends and family. We’ve had many productive conversations about immunization and how it intersects with religious beliefs and community health.

Many of my clients are trying to do what’s best for their families, and they respect authority as long as they feel respected in turn. They do, however, have internal struggles about whether getting vaccinated is a betrayal of their faith or whether it could cause harm. But once they’ve considered how immunization can help vulnerable people, some of them even feel a little embarrassed over how strongly they opposed it. All in all, we’ve managed to give at least half of our patients vaccines since I started working at the clinic—and the rate of vaccination has increased since the outbreak started.

Our efforts don’t begin or end with vaccines. We’re also trying to change how Low German–speaking families and the medical system interact with each other. More and more families have trusted English-speaking relatives who can help translate at appointments. We’re also advocating for doctor’s offices and hospitals to hire Low German–speaking people, so that the community can see that the medical system is invested in their health.

The behaviour of certain Mennonite communities during the COVID-19 pandemic did a lot of damage to the community’s reputation, which has created somewhat of an adversarial relationship with health-care workers. Several years ago, before the COVID-19 vaccine was being offered, I took my son to the hospital. The moment our care providers noticed we had a Mennonite last name, they put on all their PPE and commented that I was “one of them.” They hadn’t even checked our medical history. Health-care professionals need to avoid stigmatizing their patients like this, because such encounters produce a lot of shame and make it difficult to seek care. Instead, we need to broaden our efforts to educate and accommodate people who struggle to access health care—rather than blaming them.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752878814.0,"Flies, ‘milk snatching’ among H5N1 transmission contributors in dairy cattle","Though H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy cattle and commercial poultry are at low levels in the United States, scientists continue to sort out how the virus spreads on farms, and two new pieces of information this week shed more light on potential spread in dairy cattle: contamination from house flies and “milk snatching”.

Over the last 30 days, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reported only one detection in poultry, a game bird farm in Pennsylvania, and two detections in dairy cattle, which involved herds from California and Arizona. 

The decline in US detections appears to be part of a largely seasonal drop in cases. A new monthly update from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), which covers activity in June, said though poultry outbreaks have decreased, with only 15 reported for the month, new outbreaks in wild birds are on the rise, especially in Europe. 

In the early days of H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle, movement of infected cattle and contaminated equipment were thought to play major roles in the spread of the virus. However, outbreaks continued to occur, despite curbs on moving dairy cows among states and stepped-up biosecurity measures on farms, raising ongoing questions and intense scientific investigations into other contributing factors.

**Fly sequence stirs new buzz**

Earlier this week, Raj Rajnarayanan, MSc, PhD, a computational biologist with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University, noticed that H5N1 sequence samples from a house fly from California in October had been recently uploaded to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and posted his observations on X. Like the virus spreading in cattle, the virus belonged to the B3.13 subtype of the 2.3.4.4b clade.

“Detection of avian influenza in house flies shows these insects can mechanically move virus around farms,” Rajnarayanan wrote in a follow-up post. “No evidence they spread H5N1 to people or animals but it’s another reason to step up farm biosecurity!”

Mike Coston, a former paramedic who has been chronicling avian flu scientific developments for decades on his news blog Avian Flu Diary, in a post yesterday referenced a report from as far back as 2006 from Japan that showed blow flies found in the vicinity of a poultry outbreak could carry the virus and spread it by their feet or body following contact with infected material. 

“While we're not talking about classically 'infected' flies, it seems likely that contaminated flies may be one of many contributors to the spread of the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] virus,” he wrote, also pointing to a more recent preprint study that suggested blowflies at a Japanese crane colony could acquire the virus from dead birds or from fecal material of infected birds.

Coston also noted that peridomestic animals such as rodents and “poultry dust” have been suggested as other contributors. “Unless and until we get a better handle on how HPAI is spreading in the wild—and among and between farms—our ability to slow or contain these outbreaks will remain limited.”

**‘Milk snatching’ among routes of cow mammary gland infection**

In other developments, a Chinese research team that studied experimental infections involving different inoculation routes and resulting transmission in dairy cattle found that mouth-to-teat transmission may be how the H5N1 virus initially infects mammary glands. The team published its findings earlier this month in National Science Review.

They found that virus delivered through the nose only replicates in the mouth and respiratory tracts of dairy cattle, but inoculation into the mammary gland replicates only in that mammary gland, suggesting that entry through the teat is the only way the virus can naturally infect mammary glands.

Because some lactating cows “steal milk” through self-nursing or mutual nursing, mouth-to-teat transmission may be the route by which H5N1 initially infects the mammary glands, the team wrote. Calves were also able to transmit the virus through nursing. Investigators noted that bovine oral tissues contain high levels of sialic acid receptors, which may facilitate viral infections through contaminated feed and water and efficient replication that can last for several days.

In other experiments, researchers tested two vaccines in lactating cattle, H5 inactivated vaccine and hemagglutinin-based DNA vaccine. They found that both conferred complete protection against H5N1, even after high-dose virus challenge through direct mammary gland inoculation.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752781837.0,"Most US pregnant women, parents of young kids don't plan to accept all recommended kids' vaccines","Only 35% to 40% of US pregnant women and parents of young children say they intend to fully vaccinate their child, per survey results from researchers at Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

For the two surveys, published as a research letter this week in JAMA Network Open, the investigators recruited 174 pregnant women and 1,765 parents from a nationally representative panel in April 2024 to answer questions about their intent to have their child receive all recommended vaccines by 18 months.

""Many parents in the US choose to delay or refuse vaccines that are recommended for their child from birth to age 18 months,"" the study authors wrote. ""Research is necessary to understand the value of intervening during pregnancy to proactively support parents with vaccination decisions before the birth of the child, as implementation of such interventions will require substantial engagement of health care professionals and entities outside of the pediatric care setting.""

**Vaccine refusal highest among parents**

In total, 37.6% of pregnancies were first pregnancies. About half of respondents held a bachelor's degree or higher (49.4% of pregnant women and 45.1% of parents), and 77.6% and 79.5%, respectively, lived in urban areas.

Intent to vaccinate was similar among pregnant women and parents, at 35% to 40%. The proportion of respondents planning to refuse some or all vaccines was lowest among women pregnant for the first time (4%) and highest among parents (33%). Women in their first pregnancy were most uncertain about childhood vaccination (48%), while parents were the least unsure (4%).

""Given the high decisional uncertainty during pregnancy about vaccinating children after birth, there may be value in intervening during pregnancy to proactively support families with childhood vaccination decisions,"" the researchers wrote. 

""Future interventions should account for differences in uptake of seasonal (ie, COVID-19, influenza) vs routinely recommended vaccines,"" they added. ""Future studies with longitudinal follow-up may shed further light on evolution of vaccination decisions from pregnancy to parenthood, and the effectiveness of intervening proactively during pregnancy.""",1m2hf9y,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/most-us-pregnant-women-parents-young-kids-dont-plan-accept-all-recommended-kids,513

Plus, today’s high-stakes Senate hearing on vaccine injuries (and tips for navigating it). Here’s what’s new this week and what it means for you.

Diseases are, overall, quiet out there.

Covid-19 remains low, despite mixed signals from different data sources. The variant NB.1.8.1 is rising and now makes up 44% of tests. Historically, once a variant hits 50%, a wave tends to follow. I still think we are headed for a summer bump, but time will tell.

Yes, the plague.

Over the weekend, Coconino County, Arizona, reported a death from pneumonic plague. This is the same bacteria behind the Black Death that killed tens of millions in 14th-century Europe. But the situation today is very different.

We know how to diagnose and treat it. Antibiotics can treat it, and hospitals in endemic regions are trained to spot and manage it. But timing is everything; the plague moves fast and can overwhelm the body in hours. In this case, the patient died the same day he arrived at the hospital.

It usually spreads through fleas after contact with infected animals like prairie dogs, rabbits, or rodents. Pets, especially cats, can also bring the infection into homes if they roam and hunt outdoors.

It’s regional. In Arizona, the bacteria circulate naturally in wildlife, which is why the disease is considered endemic to the region. It’s also endemic in Northern New Mexico, Southern Colorado, Nevada, California, and Southern Oregon.

Person-to-person spread is possible, but rare. Only pneumonic plague, when the lungs are involved, can spread through respiratory droplets. The last known U.S. case of this type of transmission was over a century ago.

It’s extremely rare. The U.S. reports between 0 and 17 cases per year. The last death was in 2021.

What does this mean? Simple precautions are needed in endemic areas: don’t handle wild or dead rodents, use DEET to prevent flea bites, and keep pets on flea prevention. This is also a reminder of why public health surveillance matters. Some diseases never disappear entirely, but awareness and timely care save lives.

**Floods kill more than we can count**

Our hearts are with the families affected by the devastating floods in Texas. We share in the horror at the loss of life, the count of which is still rising. I (Katelyn) was in Central Texas this past week, and it was devastating.

As communities begin the long road to recovery, it’s important to remember that the health impacts of flooding aren’t just immediate; they often unfold over weeks and months.

New research shows that between 2000 and 2020, the U.S. saw an estimated 22,000 additional deaths in the year following major floods. To put that in perspective: one day of flooding was linked to 8.3 excess deaths per 10 million people. These aren’t just drownings or injuries. Many of the deaths were from heart attacks, strokes, respiratory disease, and other indirect causes.

Why? The authors point to several pathways:

Stress disrupts homeostasis and increases risk of injury and disease.

Floods also increase mold in houses, increasing the risk of diseases.

After displacement, people living with chronic diseases, like heart disease or diabetes, can lose access to daily medications or access to healthcare, which can be life-threatening.

Infectious diseases can spread in post-flood environments.

Flood risk is increasing due to climate change. Heavier rainfall, more airborne moisture, and event intensity are to blame.

What does this mean for you? With climate change increasing flood risk, this is a call to fund disaster relief systems that maintain access to care. Individual preparation helps, but systemic readiness saves lives.

**Today: Children’s Health Defense gets a Senate hearing**

Today, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee will hold a hearing titled “Examining Voices of the Vaccine Injured.”

This is a tough and deeply sensitive topic that requires empathy and care. While overwhelming evidence shows that vaccines’ benefits far outweigh their risks, no medical intervention is risk-free, and for those affected, even rare events feel personal and profound. A member at YLE has been injured by a vaccine and knows this far too well.

However, most of the witnesses at this hearing are not simply concerned parents. They are long-time anti-vaccine activists, some with a history of spreading false information. Yes, we need to acknowledge the real pain and suffering experienced by those who have had rare, adverse reactions to vaccines. But we also need to be transparent in highlighting that the people selected for this testimony have track records of long-standing agendas against vaccines.

The event is being promoted by Children’s Health Defense (CHD)—RFK Jr.’s organization, known for spreading anti-vaccine information—and will feature several of their regular witnesses. CHD is actively mobilizing around this hearing. Brian Hooker was promoting it on X yesterday, and it will stream on their network today. We expect it to gain significant traction within their circles.

Pushing back too hard can easily come across as cold or dismissive, making this especially difficult to navigate. We’ve pulled together some suggested tips in case you’re asked about the hearing or see it surface in your network. But, beyond anything else, remember: Most Americans, including most Republicans, support the safety of vaccines (97% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans, and 84% of MAGA supporters expressed support in a March 2025 poll.) 

The broader concern? This may be just the beginning of a coordinated push to dismantle the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).

Here’s the background: In the 1980s, a wave of lawsuits over alleged vaccine injuries made it financially unsustainable for manufacturers to stay in the market. In response, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which created the VICP—a no-fault compensation system funded by a small tax on each vaccine dose (not general taxpayer dollars). The system acknowledges that rare adverse events can happen, provides a pathway to compensation without lengthy litigation, and shields manufacturers from lawsuits that could again jeopardize vaccine supply.

Is it perfect? No. But it’s essential. Without it, we risk returning to a time when vaccine production collapsed.

**Note: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force meeting canceled**

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) had a meeting scheduled for July 10. It was abruptly canceled.

*Why this matters*: USPSTF is a cornerstone of evidence-based preventive care in the U.S. This panel of volunteer experts evaluates which preventative services (like mammograms, cholesterol screenings, or HIV prevention) should be fully covered by insurers. Services with an A or B rating must, by law, be covered without copays.

USPSTF recommendations have directly improved health outcomes. For example, after the Task Force lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45 in 2021, screening rates rose. Pre-cancerous polyps were caught earlier, and cancer rates fell in younger adults. Gender disparities in screening also narrowed.


*What it means*: Preventive services remain covered, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling in June. And so far, no changes to services or coverage of those services have been made. But canceling the meeting could be a first step toward weakening or restructuring the panel. The USPSTF functions much like the vaccine advisory committee ACIP, which RFK Jr. recently overhauled.

**Some bright spots**

A few reasons for hope this week:

NIH cracks down on publishing fees. In a big win for open science, the NIH will now cap the fees that researchers must pay to make taxpayer-funded studies available to the public. Too often, critical health findings are locked behind paywalls. This move improves access for scientists, journalists, and the public.

Professional societies push for better vaccine access. Six professional medical societies (including the American Academy of Pediatrics) sued RFK Jr. and HHS, challenging recent decisions that restrict access to Covid-19 vaccines. A pregnant physician also joined the lawsuit, citing fear she won’t be able to get a COVID-19 shot this fall.

Philanthropists understand the importance of science and the practice of public health. After NIH cut $5 million in funding to a Yale-led mental health study focused on LGBTQ+ youth, Yale alumnus Jamie Marks stepped in to keep the project alive. The study helps families support LGBTQ+ teens (one of the strongest protective factors against depression and substance use). We’re relieved this essential work will continue. More here.

In its latest weekly update today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today reported 21 more measles cases, bringing the national total since the first of the year to 1,309 cases in 40 states. Two more outbreaks were reported, putting the total at 29 for the year, up dramatically from all of 2024, when 16 outbreaks were confirmed. So far, 88% of the nation's cases have been linked to outbreaks, and 92% of people infected with the virus this year were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Last week, the United States passed the post-elimination record number of cases set in 2019. Many of the cases earlier in the year were linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, but since then there have been numerous smaller outbreaks in undervaccinated populations as well as sporadic travel-related cases.

Quest Diagnostics yesterday announced the launch of a new diagnostic test for Oropouche virus, a disease primarily spread by biting midges and some mosquito species that has spread in parts of the Americas, including the Caribbean. In the United States, several infections have been reported in people exposed during travel to Oropouche outbreak areas. In a statement, the company said the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be available with a prescription by the end of the month and that its advanced lab in San Juan Capistrano, California, will perform the test. Serology testing will be available by the end of the quarter.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) yesterday announced new measures to reduce foodborne illnesses. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the measures during the opening of the new Midwestern Food Safety Laboratory in St Louis. Some of the steps include quicker and broader Listeria testing, updating training and tools for Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) inspectors, reopening stakeholder discussion on strategies to reduce Salmonella illnesses, strengthening state partnerships, and empowering the FSIS inspectors to take compliance actions.",1m1pj5u,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/quick-takes-us-measles-cases-top-1300-oropouche-test-improved-food-safety,18

The man had accompanied his 58-year-old father, who died from his infection and appears to represent the fourth case, to the hospital. He was on the contact list and began having symptoms while under observation.

The outbreak is occurring in an area of Kerala state that has reported Nipah virus cases before. Besides the father and son, earlier outbreak patients include a 42-year-old woman from Malappuram district, an 18-year-old woman from Malappuram district who died from her illness, and a 38-year-old woman from Palakkad district.

Nipah virus is spread by fruit bats and can be transmitted between people. The virus can also be contracted by drinking palm sap or eating fruit contaminated with bat urine, droppings, or saliva. Nipah illness has a high case-fatality rate, and there are no specific treatments or vaccine, though trials are under way. 

**Human trials to launch for 2 vaccines**

In other Nipah developments, Gavi yesterday in an update on Nipah virus vaccine development said human trials for two candidate vaccines will soon launch in Bangladesh, one of the countries to report ongoing sporadic human cases. 

One is the ChAdOx1 NipahB vaccine developed at the University of Oxford that recently received the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation to accelerate regulatory approval. The vaccine’s development was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The other is PHV02 vaccine, a live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector that expresses the glycoprotein of the Nipah virus (Bangladesh strain), which is also supported by CEPI and will soon enter a phase 2 trial.",1m1posi,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/nipah/nipah-virus-infects-another-indias-hot-spot,19
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752604908.0,How Likely Is Bird Flu to Spread among Humans?,"https://archive.is/SW11f

H5N1 avian influenza has long been a concerning virus. Since its discovery in 1996 in waterfowl, bird flu has occasionally caused isolated human cases that have quite often been fatal. But last year H5N1 did something strange: it started infecting cattle.

The absolute oddity of this leap may have been somewhat lost in the flood of bad news about H5N1, which by 2024 had already caused mass die-offs of seals and other marine mammals and which was simultaneously devastating chicken farms and causing periodic shortages of eggs. But infectious disease specialists were shocked. “Flu in cows is not really a thing,” says Jenna Guthmiller, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “If you would ask anybody that studies flu on their 2024 bingo card if they had, you know, mammary infection of dairy cows on there, no one would have.”

Influenza hadn’t previously been known to infect cattle, much less cause the kind of infections in their udders that have now begun circulating in milking parlors across the country. The continued circulation of H5N1 in cows is one of the biggest concerns experts have about this flu subtype. Though H5N1 hasn’t yet spread human-to-human, people can catch the disease from cattle, mostly through close contact with infected milk. And the more it circulates in an animal that humans regularly interact with, the more chances the flu has to stumble on just the right mutation to leap to people and start adapting into something with pandemic potential.

“That’s the main thing I worry about in terms of potential human disease,” says Jonathan Runstadler, a professor of infectious disease and global health at the Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. “[It’s] increasing that interface and giving the virus the opportunity to establish infection in humans.”

Researchers are still trying to catalogue the ways the virus has adapted to spread within cows, seals, cats and hundreds of other mammal species. They’re watching for particular mutations and adaptations that might hint that a certain strain of H5N1 could start spreading from person to person. But as the surprise leap into cows shows, flu viruses sometimes do something unexpected and unpredictable. There may be unknown genetic mutations not yet on scientists’ watchlists that could change H5N1’s behavior overnight.

**The Leap to Cows**

The early spring day that H5N1 was first reported to be circulating in dairy cattle was a memorable one for Guthmiller and her colleagues. Guthmiller grew up on a 70-head dairy cattle farm in South Dakota, a biographical tidbit she never expected to overlap with her work as a flu researcher. Flu infecting the udders of cows was such an out-of-left-field idea that when cows started to show signs of sickness (such as poor appetite and discolored milk) in early 2024, veterinarians didn’t think to test for influenza at first. It was actually the simultaneous sickening of barn cats, which then tested positive for flu, that led researchers to look for the virus in the cows.

Guthmiller and her lab members were already trying to figure out the genetic sequences of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the H1N1 seasonal flu that regularly infects humans. The receptor-binding domain is a crucial but delicate fragment of the flu virus that allows it to dock onto and enter specific cells in the body. Mutations within the RBD can enable a virus to lock on to new receptors on new host cell surface. Different species have different types of these receptors, so a genetic switch by the virus can open up new host species for infection. Sometimes, however, a mutation can turn a functional virus into a functionally dead one that’s unable to invade any host at all. Guthmiller asked her graduate student Marina Good to pull the genetic sequences for the receptor-binding domain of this bizarre cow strain of H5N1. She feared that the mutated form of RBD in this strain could unlock a cell receptor that predominates in the human respiratory tract.

In general, flu viruses like to bind to tiny strings of sugars on cell surfaces called sialic acids. These sialic acids are linked together by different kinds of bonds. Avian flu tends to attach to an alpha-2,3 bond. Alpha-2,3 receptors are bountiful in the gastrointestinal tracts of waterfowl and the upper respiratory tracts of chickens.

Humans have alpha-2,3 receptors, too, but mostly in the conjunctiva, or lining of the eye, and deep in our lungs. Our upper respiratory tract is largely filled with alpha-2,6, which is the preferred target of the seasonal influenzas that typically circulate in humans. The fact that humans carry alpha-2,3 receptors in the eyes and lower respiratory tract means that we can catch H5N1; currently this appears as mild pink eye or occasionally as a profoundly serious viral pneumonia. Even so, the virus doesn’t easily infect the lining of our nose and throat. If it did, humans likely would have spread the disease to one another rapidly via coughing, sneezing and simply breathing.

Less than a month after the first public report of H5N1 in a dairy cow in March 2024, Good, Guthmiller and their colleagues discovered a bit of good news that they posted on the preprint site bioRxiv: The flu hadn’t made this crucial shift, meaning the circulating strain still preferred alpha-2,3 receptors. (These findings have been replicated multiple times since then, suggesting this is still the case.) What the virus had done, however, was become less choosy about the alpha-2,3-containing sugars it could bind with, Guthmiller says, likely helping enable the sudden spread within cows and other mammals.

In some ways, labeling influenza types “avian” or “mammalian” can be a little misleading, says Daniel Perez, a professor of poultry medicine at the University of Georgia who studies how viruses leap from animals to humans. Perez and his team have been studying a modified form of H5N1 that is less deadly to animals, and they’re finding that the virus’s big evolutionary shift has been to replicate more easily in wild bird airways, not just in their gastrointestinal tracts.

“The changes that we’re actually seeing in the virus are not necessarily mammalian-adapted mutations,” Perez says. “What we are seeing is more of these respiratory-adapted mutations that occasionally do help it to replicate better in mammals.”

The shift to mammals might have been incidental at first. But now mutations are accumulating in the cattle version of the virus. For instance, they found a mutation in the amino acids at a position in the virus strain’s genome called 631, a spot where changes are known to help a virus better interact with mammalian proteins inside the cell. These proteins are involved in the translation of genetic instructions to cellular activity, including the replication of genes that the virus needs to reproduce. “What we’re starting to see are sprinklings of more of these mammalian adaptions happening in the background of this cattle strain,” says Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University.

As this mammalian spread continues, Lakdawala and other infectious disease researchers worry about further mutations that would help this flu spread even more easily between mammals. This might happen in a slow and stepwise fashion, leading to more animal-human spillovers, followed by household transmission between close contacts and finally to community spread, Lakdawala says. Or it might be quick: another worry is reassortment, the ability of a flu virus to snag genetic material from another flu virus more adept at infecting people. A person who happened to be infected with both avian flu and seasonal flu could be ground zero for this kind of change. “If this virus continues to circulate in cows and continues to have these sporadic spillover events, eventually it’s going to gain segments through reassortment with either a human seasonal strain or a pig strain or another bird strain,” Lakdawala says. If that happens, a pandemic could take off overnight.

[...] 

**The Future of Flu**

The CDC ended its emergency response to avian flu in early July, citing a decline in animal cases and the absence of human cases since February 2025. Avian flu is somewhat seasonal, with peaks in fall and spring as wild birds migrate.

But evolution happens over longer time scales. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic, known as the “swine flu” pandemic, was caused by a new H1N1 flu strain that had emerged from a mix of several pig flus, a human flu and an avian flu. Oddly, people older than age 60 had some preexisting immunity to this new Frankenstein’s monster of a virus, which turned out to be because it shared similarity with the descendants of the devastating 1918 pandemic flu. These long-ago flu lineages had been in circulation when people aged 60-plus in 2009 were kids but had been replaced by H2N2 viruses in 1957. Pig versions had persisted, however, gradually evolving and swapping bits of genes with avian and human flus. Before the 2009 virus had emerged, a handful of farm workers had been infected with these “triple-reassorted” viruses, but these infections didn’t go on to infect others. Then, “all of a sudden, the North American pig lineage grabbed two segments from the Eurasian pig lineages, probably somewhere in [Mexico], and that virus started to spill over,” Lakdawala says. 

A new human pandemic, which may have killed around half a million people worldwide, was born.

Fortunately, there are already approved human vaccines for H5N1, Perez says. These are based on older strains, but the vaccines would probably still protect against severe disease should the virus start spreading human-to-human. Preexisting vaccine know-how and newer technologies such as those used to create mRNA vaccines would also allow for the quick development of updated vaccines, he says.
Whether H5N1 causes the next flu pandemic, it’s safe to say one will come. There have been four flu pandemics since 1918, and today’s high-density agricultural practices provide prime hunting ground for viruses. On poultry farms, nearly 175 million birds have been affected since 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 

Egg-laying operations have been dense for decades, but similar practices are spreading to other types of animal husbandry. Small farms with a few dozen cows, like the one Guthmiller grew up on, were once common. Now farms with at least 1,000 cows comprise more than 55 percent of the dairy herds in the U.S., according to the USDA. This density, along with the practice of moving cows between herds, means that viral spillovers that might have once died out on a small farm in South Dakota can now spread far and wide.

In that sense, rather than a revolutionary understanding of influenza, Perez says, the best course of action might be a rethinking of agricultural practices. Humans are increasing the size of farms without increasing farm hygiene, which sets the stage for the emergence of new pathogens.

“Yes, we can keep making better vaccines faster,” he says. But an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. “It would be much easier if we created the conditions of raising animals in a way that actually prevents emergence of disease instead of promoting them,” Perez says. “The best vaccine is the one we don’t have to use.”",1m0pzyn,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-bird-flu-spread-between-humans-heres-what-it-would-take/,45

Its safety committee reviewed 28 reports of serious side effects following vaccination with Ixchiq, made by Valneva. Most involved people ages 65 and older and those with multiple chronic or uncontrolled underlying medical conditions. Three cases were fatal. The side effects worsened patients’ medical condition or a deterioration in general health. Many side effects were similar chikungunya symptoms, which are typically mild but can be serious in 2 in 100 patients. The group also looked at encephalitis reports, noting that frequency is not known. They said the vaccine is effective at triggering antibodies against chikungunya, which may benefit older people who are at risk of severe complications from the disease. They note that since Ixchiq is a live-virus vaccine, it is already contraindicated for people who have weakened immune systems.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752412274.0,UK: Parents urged to get children vaccinated after measles death in Liverpool,"  Health officials have urged people to come forward for the measles vaccine if they are not up-to-date with their shots after a child at Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool died from the disease.

The city has experienced a surge in cases among young people, with the hospital warning parents last week that the spike in infections was due to falling rates of uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

According to The Sunday Times, the child was ill with measles and other health problems and was receiving treatment at the Alder Hey.

A statement from the Alder Hey Children’s NHS trust said: “To respect patient confidentiality, we can’t comment on individual cases.”

Uptake of the vaccine has fallen across the country in the past decade with rates across England now at 84%. In Liverpool, only 73% of children aged five have received the necessary two shots, while in parts of London uptake is below 65%. To ensure herd immunity, where enough people are protected to prevent the virus spreading, vaccination rates must hit 95%.

“The NHS MMR vaccine gives lifelong protection against becoming seriously unwell, so with cases of measles on the rise, it is not worth the risk of going without this vital protection,” said Chris Streather, the medical director for the NHS in London.

“Measles, mumps and rubella are preventable, but catching them is easy when people are unvaccinated, so I urge people to come forward and get the MMR vaccine sooner, rather than later,” he added. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1752320639.0,"COVID cases likely rising in half of states, CDC estimates","Cases of COVID-19 are now likely growing in 25 states, according to estimates published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, as this year's summer wave of the virus appears to be getting underway.

The agency's modeling suggests that the uptick is in ""many"" Southeast, Southern and West Coast states, the CDC said in its weekly update. 

COVID-19 activity nationwide, however, is still considered ""low,"" based on data from wastewater samples, although that is up from ""very low"" the week before.

Some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in emergency rooms are in the Pacific Northwest, which saw a steep rise in ER visits during June, and in the Southeast, which has seen rates steadily inch up for weeks. Rates are now the highest they've been since February and March in those regions.

Health officials have been watching for an increase in COVID-19 this summer, as new variants have spread to the U.S. after fueling surges overseas. 

A CDC analysis published Thursday concluded that the virus has settled into twice-a-year surges nationwide, typically peaking first in July through September and then a second time later in December through February.

Those surges look to be linked to cycles of genetic changes to a part of the virus that scientists call the S1 region, a key part of the spike protein of the virus that binds to human cells.

""Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues,"" the scientists wrote in the CDC analysis.

COVID-19's rise comes as health officials have been probing reports of an unusual uptick in another respiratory virus called parvovirus B19. While many people develop no symptoms from parvovirus B19 infections, some people get sick with signs like fever and muscle pains, followed by a rash.

The CDC warned late last month of a ""sustained increase"" in transmission of parvovirus B19, and suggested that pregnant women consider masking to curb the risk of severe complications. Some local health departments have also tracked a rise in emergency rooms treating cases of this virus.

""Several of the most recent weeks saw the highest percentage of B19-associated ED visits compared to the same week in all years since 2015,"" health officials in Chicago warned on Thursday.

There have been 1,288 confirmed measles cases across 38 states nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By comparison, the U.S. recorded 285 cases all of last year, CDC data showed.

This marks the highest number of cases since 1992. The previous high occurred in 2019 when the U.S. reported 1,274 cases.

""I think this is unfortunately just the beginning,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,, told ABC News. ""I think things will continue to worsen in the United States in terms of return of childhood illnesses and ... I'm quite worried that what we're seeing in the U.S. is not going to stay in the U.S.""

The states with confirmed cases include: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.

Among the nationally confirmed cases, the CDC said 92% are among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.

Meanwhile, 4% of cases are among those who have received just one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and 4% of cases are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.

A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that the agency ""continues to support community efforts in dealing with the measles outbreaks. CDC continues to provide technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as requested.""

""The risk of measles infection is low for the overall U.S. population, with a case rate of less than 0.4 per 100,000 people -- lower than peer developed countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy,"" the statement continued. ""Measles risk is higher in U.S. communities with low vaccination rates in areas with active measles outbreaks or with close social and/or geographic linkages to areas with active measles outbreaks.""

According to the CDC, there have been at least 27 outbreaks this year, accounting for 88% of confirmed cases. By comparison, 16 outbreaks were recorded in 2024.

Texas experienced a large outbreak this year, with 753 cases reported since January. The rate of spread has slowed in recent weeks, with few cases reported.

At least two school-aged children have died. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, according to Texas health officials.

A third measles death was recorded in New Mexico among an unvaccinated adult who tested positive after dying, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. [...] 

The rate of kindergarteners receiving state-required vaccinations dropped from 95% during the 2019-2020 school year to less than 93% during the 2023-2024 school year.

About 280,000 U.S. kindergarteners, or 7.3%, are not fully vaccinated with the two-dose measles vaccine.

Herd immunity – which is when enough people are immune to a disease that it can't spread from person to person -- is typically reached when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated.

Hotez said the national -- and state -- vaccination rates seem good at first glance, but the problem lies in county level vaccination rates, which can be quite low.

""What you're seeing is ... counties that are consistently way below 90% and and that's where you get into problems,"" he said ""That's where ... you lose herd immunity.""

The HHS spokesperson said the CDC ""continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles,"" but also said the decision to receive the vaccine is ""a personal one.""

The six groups -- including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) -- as well as a pregnant woman filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The organizations, representing pediatricians, infectious disease physicians and public health professionals, accused the HHS and Kennedy of intentionally taking away vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine, and unjustly replacing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) entire vaccine advisory panel.

The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin Kennedy's new COVID vaccine recommendations and a declaratory judgment pronouncing the change as unlawful. 

Kennedy ""has been on a warpath. It's gotten to the point that we are going to ... ask the court to put a stop to it,"" Richard H. Hughes IV, a partner at Epstein Becker Green and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, told ABC News. ""This decision to unilaterally overturn the COVID recommendation based on a history of bias -- it was an arbitrary, capricious decision. They didn't make any effort to follow any ordinary processes.""

Hughes said the HHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a U.S. federal law that establishes procedures federal agencies must follow when making rules.

ABC News has reached out to HHS to request comment on the lawsuit.

[...] 

The anonymous pregnant woman, who is also a plaintiff, has been unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccine since Kennedy made the announcement, the suit states. The woman is a physician in a hospital, which could place her at high risk for exposure to infectious diseases, according to the lawsuit.

""Secretary Kennedy's changes to vaccine recommendations have frustrated our members' ability to effectively counsel patients regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and compromised the standard of care,"" Dr. Sindhu K. Srinivas, president of the SMFM, said in a statement.

The statement went on, ""Every second the Secretary's dangerous and unsupported decisions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines stay in effect, the Directive is putting up barriers for our members' high-risk pregnant patients to access the COVID-19 vaccine, which is increasing the risk of serious infection and illness and eroding patient trust in all recommended vaccinations.""

The plaintiffs also expressed alarm over Kennedy's move last month to remove all 17 members from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and appoint seven new members. Kennedy originally appointed eight members, but one of them dropped off the panel shortly after.

At the time, the HHS put out a press release justifying the removals, with Kennedy saying. ""A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science.""

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751914630.0,Australia: Deadly Hendra virus confirmed for first time since 2022,"A deadly animal-borne virus that can also infect humans has resurfaced in South East Queensland, with authorities confirming the state’s first case of Hendra virus since 2022.

An unvaccinated horse died on a property last week after rapidly deteriorating, with tests later confirming it had contracted the highly infectious virus.

Biosecurity Queensland and Queensland Health are now working to manage the risk to humans and other animals.

The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries released a statement on Sunday confirming the incident.

Biosecurity Queensland acting chief veterinary officer Fiona Thompson said staff were working closely with the horse owner to ensure the risk was contained on the property.

“Unfortunately, in this case, the deceased horse had not been vaccinated for Hendra virus,” Dr Thompson said.

Dr Thompson said the property was under active surveillance, and health authorities had already assessed potential exposure to other animals and people.

“Tracing and exposure assessments have been undertaken on other horses and animals on the property,” she said.

“We are also working with Queensland Health in relation to humans who may have had contact with the infected horse so their experts can manage the health of people involved.”

Queensland chief health officer Heidi Carroll confirmed that public health staff had already contacted those believed to have been exposed.

“While the Hendra virus can spread from horses to people, it is rare,” Dr Carroll said.

“We know from past cases of Hendra virus infection in horses that most people exposed remain well and don’t contract the infection.

“People who are assessed as having a high level of exposure to the infected horse will undergo prioritised testing for the virus.”

Racing Queensland also released a statement, encouraging owners to vaccinate their horses.

“The horse involved was not a racehorse. The location of the property has not been disclosed at this time,” the statement read.

“Racing Queensland joins Biosecurity Queensland in encouraging owners to vaccinate their horses.”

Queensland Health also warned that horses could be infectious before showing signs of illness and urged people who worked with horses to maintain strict hygiene practices, including regular handwashing and covering wounds with waterproof dressings.

Hendra virus is spread from flying foxes to horses and can then be transmitted to dogs or humans. There is no vaccine for humans, and the disease has proven fatal in the past.

Since the virus was first identified in 1994, more than 90 horses are known to have been infected. All either died from the virus or were euthanised.

Seven people have contracted Hendra virus after close contact with infected horses, and four have died. The most recent fatal case occurred in 2009.

Dr Thompson urged horse owners to act quickly if their animal became sick.

“Hendra virus infection can occur throughout the year, so it’s important that horse owners and people in contact with horses take steps to protect themselves and their animals at all times,” she said.

“We’d urge them to continue to practise good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures, even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus.”

Dr Thompson also commended the vet involved for their quick action in managing the case and containing the risk.

Queensland Health said people infected with Hendra virus typically experienced flu-like symptoms and, in some cases, encephalitis, a serious inflammation of the brain that can cause headaches, fever and drowsiness.

In horses, symptoms of the virus can vary but often include fever, increased heart rate and restlessness.

Bat Conservation and Rescue Queensland president Mel Brennan has previously highlighted the critical role flying foxes play in maintaining local ecosystems.

“Without them, there is no native forest or koalas,” she said.

“If you don’t touch them, they’re not a risk.”",1lu2oto,https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/deadly-hendra-virus-confirmed-in-state-for-first-time-since-2022/news-story/13d6c22e0e9c1ba6aa4bdb1617e7b3eb,72
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751911868.0,Measles reaches highest number since elimination. Start of a Covid wave? (via YLE),"YLE is back from a much-needed break. Happy (belated) 4th of July to this beautiful and complicated country. It’s messy, but it’s ours. And I look forward to continuing the fight for the health of everyone who lives here because, after all, true freedom depends on good health. [...] 

**Measles cases have reached an all-time high since elimination**

Well, it finally happened. Over the weekend, the U.S. reached 1,281 measles cases in 2025—the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000, and the most we’ve seen since 1992 (when there were 2,126 cases).

We’ve managed to keep measles at bay for decades thanks to high vaccination rates. But those rates are slipping, and since measles is the most contagious virus on Earth, it’s often the first to resurge when vaccination coverage declines. Interestingly, measles also flares up every four to five years for decades (even before vaccinations) for reasons we epidemiologists don’t know.

A high case count doesn’t automatically mean the U.S. loses its measles elimination status. That status—defined by the WHO—means measles is not endemic in the U.S. (i.e., it doesn’t spread continuously without being sparked by international travel).

Note: Contrary to rumors blaming measles on illegal immigration, historical data shows that measles is usually caught abroad by U.S. residents, who then bring it back home. Here’s the data.

We would only lose that designation if an outbreak lasts more than 12 months. Currently, we’re about halfway to losing elimination status, thanks to a large West Texas outbreak that began in January and is still simmering. Although it has slowed, transmission continues across multiple counties in several states, making it a key driver of the national surge.

CDC updates the measles count every Wednesday, so I expect headlines when the count is “official” (my referenced number is in big thanks to the Yale School of Public Health, which keeps a more up-to-date tally). If you’re up to date on your vaccines, your risk of measles remains very low. Here are your top 10 FAQ on MMR and measles protection.

**Covid-19: Summer wave brewing?**

Covid-19 levels remain low overall, but we may be seeing early signs of a summer wave. Wastewater data—an early and reliable indicator of community spread—is sending mixed signals. CDC’s wastewater data hasn’t shifted much, but another source, WastewaterSCAN, is showing a rise across all U.S. regions (see below). In some states, such as Nevada and Texas, levels are increasing in both datasets. Another early indicator—the number of positive tests—has also begun increasing.

Will we see a national summer wave? I’d be surprised if we didn’t. Three forces usually drive a surge:

Weather/humidity and human behavior (more indoor time during summer heat)

Waning immunity (it’s the highest it’s ever been following a mild winter wave and minimal vaccination rates)

Variants (Covid-19 keeps mutating. The latest Omicron descendant [NB.1.8.1] is circulating but not spreading as quickly as it did in other countries)

Typically, the U.S. follows Europe’s lead, and in the U.K., Covid-19 cases were increasing slightly, but they have now started to decrease, resulting in a wimpy summer wave thus far. This may suggest that the U.S. will not experience a significant summer wave either. However, these days it’s so hard to compare across countries given different landscapes. (For example, in the U.K. more than 60% get vaccinated for Covid compared to US’s 25%.)

Covid-19 is still a relatively young virus. We don’t fully understand its seasonal rhythm. For now, we wait. If you’re over 65 or severely immunocompromised, make sure you’re up to date on your Covid-19 vaccines (that means two doses a year.)

**Buckle up for Medicaid cuts**

Last week, Congress passed the largest health care cuts in U.S. history. Nearly $1 trillion will be cut over the next ten years. Instead of building a future where we prevent disease, feed children, reduce medical debt, and help people live longer, this bill takes us in the opposite direction.

Millions will lose coverage. Hundreds of hospitals may shut down, particularly in rural areas, with up to 400 at risk. (Hover over the map below to see the number in your state.) One in four nursing homes could also close. Together, this will result in an expected 50,000 people dying each year from preventable causes.

There’s been a striking lack of clear, plain-language explanations about what’s actually in the bill. Even headlines like “11 million may lose health insurance” don’t explain how or why. I’ll be back Wednesday with a “translation.”

What can we do? These changes rely on administrative burden to quietly trim coverage. The confusion alone will result in people losing access to care, saving the federal government money. That means we’re not powerless:

Help neighbors: Many will face new forms, deadlines, and confusing rules.

Inform families: Kids aren’t auto-enrolled in free school lunch anymore.

Check CHIP: Children may still qualify for Medicaid even if their parents lose coverage.

Support: Donate to rural hospitals, food pantries, and care networks.

Vote: This is a policy choice. Make your voice heard.

Spread the word: Only 8% of Americans are even aware that Medicaid cuts were included in this bill.

These cuts will take years to unfold and are usually implemented quietly, bureaucratically, and devastatingly. Let’s not let that happen.

**RFK Jr.’s latest anti-vaccine crusade goes global**

RFK Jr. announced that the U.S. will no longer financially support GAVI, the global vaccine alliance. This is a direct hit to one of the most effective public health partnerships in modern history.

What is GAVI?
GAVI—the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization—was created in 2000 to solve a very specific problem: vaccines were being developed, but the poorest countries couldn’t afford them, and manufacturers had no financial incentive to serve those markets. GAVI stepped in to bridge this gap. By pooling donor funding and purchasing vaccines in bulk, GAVI makes them affordable and accessible in countries where disease outbreaks are most deadly and health systems are weakest.

Thanks to GAVI, more than 1 billion children in low- and middle-income countries have been vaccinated, and more than 17 million lives have been saved. Today, GAVI helps vaccinate nearly half the world’s children. It is one of the clearest examples of what successful, coordinated global health action looks like.

Yet in his justification, RFK Jr. barely mentions any of this. Instead, he used the announcement to cast doubt on vaccines. He cited a flawed 2017 observational study to claim that DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus) vaccines increase mortality in girls, ignoring confounding, biases, and the fact that more rigorous follow-up studies—including studies by the same researchers—found no such effect. Their 2022 conclusion: “We did not find that DTP was associated with increased female mortality.”

The U.S. provided about 13% of GAVI’s budget (second highest contributor behind the U.K.). The funding was already appropriated through 2030, and it doesn’t even flow through HHS—it’s part of the State Department’s foreign aid. But apparently, process and procedure no longer matter. The Gates Foundation has since pledged $1.6 billion to help fill the gap, but it is likely not enough.

Why does this matter to you? Pulling support from GAVI isn’t just bad in humanitarian and global leadership terms; it could also be dangerous—undermining global disease prevention, weakening pandemic preparedness, and threatening the health of children everywhere, including here in the U.S.

**Good news: Payers speaking up, preventive care, HHS restructuring, and NIH grants**

We’ll take all the wins we can get:

Payers start to speak up. AHIP (national health insurance association) and the Alliance of Community Health Plans affirmed their commitment to covering fall vaccines, ensuring patients aren’t left with unexpected costs, regardless of what RFK Jr. recommends. Of course, it could vary by payer. The first payer, Blue Shield of California, said that it will cover all routine vaccinations. I expect more to come out soon.

Preventive care is protected. The Supreme Court ruled that insurers must continue to cover preventive services at no cost, including cancer screenings and PrEP.

Caveat: RFK Jr. will have oversight over the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines whether a preventive intervention helps patients. He could gut and replace that whole committee, like he did with vaccines. Time will tell.

HHS mass firings and reorganization blocked by a federal judge that deemed it “probably unlawful” and issued a temporary block to the reorg’s next steps.

NIH grants partially reinstated. Another judge reinstated $1.1 billion in NIH research grants, but only in states whose attorneys general joined the lawsuit. These are overwhelmingly blue states. Universities are still awaiting the arrival of the funds.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751719385.0,NYT: I’m a Pediatrician. I’m Afraid of Diseases I Thought I’d Never See.,"Pediatricians like me come to our job with the conviction that children should not die — that whatever might hurt or kill them should be prevented, whether through car seat laws, safety tops on medication bottles, pediatric cancer research or, above all, routine vaccination.

Now we’re worried that vaccination will become less routine and less available. That the health care structure that keeps children safe may be under threat. That we will watch children suffer and even die, watch families grieve — and that part of the horror will be knowing that these were preventable diseases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory group met last week — its first meeting since the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., dismissed the panel’s 17 experts and installed eight handpicked replacements, several with histories of vaccine skepticism. There, the panel, down to seven members after one withdrew, announced a review of the entire childhood vaccine schedule.

That’s scary. The recommendations of the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, help determine what vaccines are provided at no cost for about half of American children through the Vaccines for Children Program and influence coverage by private insurers. If the committee turns science-based recommendations into wishy-washy talk-to-your-doctor suggestions or, worse, takes certain vaccines off the schedule, America risks unraveling the infrastructure that keeps children vaccinated and without polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, bacterial meningitis and all the other horrors.

“Every day I have at least one parent ask me, ‘Are you still going to be able to give vaccines? Can I do something now in case they’re not available later?’” said my colleague Dr. Jane Guttenberg, a pediatrician in New York City.

Can we imagine a two-tiered system in which protection is available only to those with the means to pay hundreds of dollars for a vaccination? Can we imagine not giving a vaccine that a child needs? “I’ve been thinking about that a lot,” said Dr. Sally Goza, a primary care pediatrician in suburban Georgia.

 “Vaccines cost us money. I can’t just give vaccines away. I wish I could.”

Nowadays, all around the world, an overwhelming majority of children live to adulthood. For much of history, almost half did not. Child mortality is still higher than it should be, and there are still harsh inequities, but this change probably ranks as humanity’s greatest achievement.

Getting here required improving nutrition; ridding drinking water of sewage; finding antibiotics to treat infections; figuring out how to resuscitate newborns and repair congenital heart defects; and so much more.

Vaccines have been absolutely a key to this; infant and child mortality started falling after smallpox became a preventable disease, thanks to the brilliant discovery at the end of the 18th century that you could turn on immunity against the most feared killer virus by tricking the immune system with a weaker, more benign virus.

Now, vaccination rates are dropping in the United States and many other countries, in part because of increased vaccine hesitancy and disinformation. Pediatricians are encountering more parents who are afraid to vaccinate their children. Dr. Goza now needs her staff to check the vaccination status every time a parent calls about a young child with a fever, since a fever in an unvaccinated infant may mean the baby is in serious danger and has to be sent to the emergency room for tests.

“I never want to see a case of polio, but I’m very fearful I will,” she said.

During my medical training in the 1980s, I worried constantly about Haemophilus influenzae Type B, or Hib, which causes devastating bacterial infections of the bloodstream (bacteremia), spinal cord (meningitis) and throat (epiglottitis). The throat infection could quickly cut off a child’s airway, requiring an emergency tracheotomy, a surgical incision into a child’s windpipe. We did blood tests and spinal taps — so many spinal taps — and we watched helplessly in the pediatric intensive care unit as children who were perfectly healthy a week earlier struggled to survive and often ended up neurologically devastated. The Hib vaccine was introduced, and in the 1990s these infections largely went away.

But unless you wipe them out, these diseases come back if you stop vaccinating. For the first 25 years of his career, Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City, never saw a child with Hib meningitis. But this spring he was an author of a report on two cases of severe disease in unvaccinated New York infants.

Up until recently, we were clearly moving forward. We learned about certain diseases from older pediatricians who had seen them before they were preventable, but we never expected to treat them ourselves. I never saw polio during my training, but I had teachers who had managed children in iron lungs. We also didn’t see measles.

“I graduated from med school in 2002 with the full comfort that we had eliminated measles in the U.S.,” said Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer for Covenant Health Lubbock, which treated many of the children hospitalized in Texas in the recent measles outbreak. “Goodness, the world looks different today.”

When Dr. Johnson was 4, in 1980, she had Hib epiglottitis, and she still has the tracheotomy scar. By the time she trained as a pediatrician, there were no new cases, but there were still meningitis survivors, many with severe neurological problems.

We need to keep children safe. We need Medicaid. We need vaccines. We need clear recommendations. We need the Vaccines for Children Program.
Truly science-based guidance will continue to come from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Already groups are mobilizing to help families follow those recommendations, including pressing insurance companies to continue to cover essential vaccines.
Pediatricians and parents will need to keep pushing back against misinformation and against the anxieties that are being deliberately and needlessly fomented. Research suggests that sustained engagement with concerned parents can help overcome vaccine hesitancy. There are parents who devote themselves, often in memory of a dead or devastated child, to vaccine advocacy, but no one should have to go through the heartbreak they have gone through.

Dr. Tammy Camp, a professor of pediatrics at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, described an infant last year who developed bad whooping cough and spent time in the pediatric intensive care unit being fed through a tube into his stomach because he could not stop coughing enough to drink. Whooping cough cases have risen amid falling vaccine rates; and the baby, too young to be vaccinated, was somehow exposed. 

His mother and grandmother told her that they had had no idea how terrible the disease was. The grandmother showed Dr. Camp a video of the child’s tiny body racked with the characteristic and sometimes life-threatening cough. “We’ve all seen those videos,” Dr. Camp said. We used to watch them in medical school to learn about a historical disease, a disease we expected to see rarely, if at all.

Will we really tolerate turning back this clock?

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751760255.0,He beat a fungal infection. So why was he so ill again?,"When Peter Redweik’s physicians finally realized that his splitting headaches, slurred speech and stumbling gait were caused by cryptococcal meningitis — a severe inflammation of his brain caused by a fungal infection — they prescribed amphotericin B.

The medication causes such awful side effects — kidney damage, anemia, nausea, seizures — that doctors call it “amphoterrible” and usually reserve it for life-threatening infections. Redweik had picked up a fungal infection, probably during a visit to Vancouver Island in mid-2016, and there was little doubt he now was near death: He was crashing into walls when he tried to walk and vomiting frequently.

“He was probably within a day or two of dying when he got to the hospital,” said Redweik’s wife, Joyce.

Redweik was hospitalized from August to October while doctors blasted the fungus in his system with amphotericin. He lost his hearing and went blind in one eye from the pressure of swelling on critical nerves. His kidneys were damaged by the medication. He couldn’t walk or even swallow, receiving nutrition through a feeding tube in his nose.

A former competitive weightlifter, Redweik, who was 58 years old at the time, lost 63 pounds.

But after six weeks, the amphotericin seemed to have killed the fungus. Laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid began to run clear. He started relearning how to walk, swallow and take care of himself. On Oct. 17, he went home to continue recuperating, and a few weeks later, he attended his daughter’s wedding, even walking a few steps down the aisle with her.

Four days later, though, while sitting on a couch at his home in Arizona, Redweik passed out. At a Tucson hospital, he complained of pain in his eye sockets. The pressure in his brain had soared, and a surgeon there installed a shunt in his head that routed the excess cerebrospinal fluid into his abdomen.

But soon, his ability to walk regressed and he lapsed into near-unconsciousness. More amphotericin seemed like the only choice. Yet cultures of his spinal fluid showed definitively the fungus was dead. What good would another round of “amphoterrible” do?

Stumped by Redweik’s continuing severe illness, his doctor tracked down a specialist in fungal diseases at the National Institutes of Health who said he knew of cases like Redweik’s. Peter Williamson, chief of the translational mycology section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a hunch about how to treat Redweik. But Redweik needed to come to the NIH’s clinical center, the research hospital for severely ill patients where Williamson worked. Only then was Redweik’s condition identified and treated, saving his life.

When his crushing headaches began in the spring of 2017, Redweik gobbled over-the-counter painkillers and eventually visited the emergency room near his Green Valley, Arizona, home. There he received a common diagnosis for people in hot, dry climates: dehydration.

He and Joyce didn’t believe it. Redweik had once developed a blood clot in his calf, and they were concerned he had another in his head. They wanted an MRI, but the wait to see a neurologist was four to six months, and Redweik was starting a new job in Plano, Texas, leaving ahead of Joyce, who would join him later.

There, his condition worsened. The headaches were nearly unbearable and had spread down his neck. He began throwing up two or three times a day, and his gait was unsteady.

“It was like I was intoxicated,” Redweik recalled. “I couldn’t walk steadily. I was hoping people weren’t watching. It was like I was going to work drunk.”

During a visit a few weeks later, Joyce Redweik found her husband confused and disoriented. By August, Peter Redweik was falling down when he tried to walk. He needed a wheelchair. He finally got in to see a neurologist and had an MRI exam.

There was no blood clot. But given his condition, Redweik was admitted to the hospital, where tests revealed cryptococcal meningitis, which, left untreated, can be fatal. He began therapy with amphotericin.

The Redweiks had spent their adult lives in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, so it was unusual that Peter was infected by a fungus, Cryptococcus gattii, that thrives in a wet, temperate, forested climate. But they had visited Vancouver Island, which had such a climate, the year before, so perhaps that was where Peter was exposed.

With dangerous pressure building up in his brain, Redweik endured painful lumbar punctures to drain cerebrospinal fluid every few days. Eventually, that procedure was replaced by a lumbar drain installed in his lower back that siphoned off the fluid when the pressure grew too high.

After six weeks, laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid were negative. The amphotericin had finally killed the fungus, and he began relearning how to walk, swallow and take care of himself.

During the AIDS epidemic, fungal diseases infected hundreds of thousands of people whose weakened immune systems could not ward off cryptococcosis and pneumocystis pneumonia. With the development of powerful medications to control HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, very few cases now occur.

According to the NIH’s Williamson, only about 3,000 people are infected by the cryptococcus fungus each year. About 1,000 are HIV patients, another 1,000 are people with suppressed immune systems such as transplant recipients, and 1,000 are previously healthy people like Redweik. About a third of the 3,000 die.

When Redweik collapsed on his couch and was taken to the hospital again with what seemed like a relapse, his doctors were puzzled. Lab cultures of his spinal fluid showed no evidence of live fungus, but he still showed symptoms of severe meningitis. One test might be wrong, but not several. Should they ignore the results and try to kill the fungus again?

In a search for that answer, one of Redweik’s physicians found Williamson’s name online and contacted him. 

According to Williamson, a subset of the previously healthy patients suffer an autoimmune reaction after the fungus is killed: a post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome, or PIIRS. It is not unlike the inflammatory response that has produced long covid in some people.

Williamson was confident that Redweik was one of those patients and his immune system still considered the fungus a threat. It had amped up the various cells that attack invaders, focusing on tiny particles of the fungus — proteins it had released and cell walls that still remained in Redweik’s system after the cryptococcus was vanquished.

That is what unleashed another round of inflammation and the new symptoms, Williamson theorized.

Redweik was declining quickly when he arrived at the NIH, and Williamson put him on large doses of the steroid methylprednisolone to suppress the immune response, along with the antifungal fluconazole in case the cryptococcus fungus somehow flourished again.

It may be that microscopic particles of the fungus were still in Redweik’s brain, triggering swelling and pressure akin to his meningitis as the immune system attacked, according to Williamson. Or perhaps antibodies were able to travel to areas of the brain and produce generalized inflammation, he said.
“It is so counterintuitive,” Williamson said. Doctors “treat again with amphotericin because they don’t know.” But “it’s the delay in diagnosis and the inflammatory response that kills you,” he said. “It’s the edema [swelling] that kills you.”

After about three days, Redweik began to respond to the steroids and his symptoms started to fade.[...] 

Today he still has difficulty hearing, he remains blind in his right eye, and his legs are numb below the knees, he said. With Stage 3 kidney disease caused by the amphotericin, he may one day need dialysis.
But even with those deficits, Redweik has regained his weight and resumed the retired life he and Joyce had planned. After more than 50 years together, the couple is grateful for that.

“I consider myself to be living a normal life,” he said. “I can do most of the things I was able to do.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751716024.0,"WHO: Avian Influenza A(H5N1) - Cambodia Situation Report, July 5, 2025","Between 1 January and 1 July 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Cambodia’s International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. **Seven of the 11 cases were reported in June, an unusual monthly increase.**

Avian influenza A(H5N1) was first detected in Cambodia, in December 2003, initially affecting wild birds. Since then, 83 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 49 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] of 59%), have been reported in the country. While the virus continued to circulate in avian species, no human cases were reported between 2014 and 2022, after which, the virus re-emerged in humans in February 2023. Since the re-emergence of human A(H5N1) infections in Cambodia in 2023, a total of 27 cases have been reported (six in 2023, 10 in 2024, and 11 to date in 2025), of which 12 were fatal (CFR 44%).

Seventeen of the cases occurred in children under 18 years old. Avian influenza A(H5N1) is circulating in wild birds, poultry and some mammals around the world, and occasional human infections following exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments are expected to occur. In cases detected in Cambodia, exposure to sick poultry, often poultry kept in backyards, has been reported. 

According to the IHR, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on currently available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. For those occupationally exposed to the virus, such as farm workers, the risk is low to moderate, depending on the measures in place. WHO routinely reassesses this risk to factor in new information.

**Description of the Situation**

Between 1 January and 1 July 2025, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of the Kingdom of Cambodia notified WHO of 11 laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (clade 2.3.2.1e- formerly classified as 2.3.2.1c; from cases where virus sequences are available to date) including six deaths [CFR: 54%]. These cases are reported from the provinces of Siem Reap (4), Takeo (2), Kampong Cham (1), Kampong Speu (1), Kratie (1), Prey Veng (1), Svay Rieng (1). Of the total cases reported in 2025, seven cases were reported in June 2025.

Males account for 63% of the cases. Of the 11 cases, three cases were reported in less than five-year-olds, two cases were between the age of 5 and 18 years and six cases were reported in the age group 18-65 years. All cases had exposure – handling or culling - of sick poultry, often kept in backyards.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) was detected for the first time in Cambodia in December 2003, initially affecting wild birds. Between 2014 and 2022, there were no reports of human infection with A(H5N1) viruses. However, the re-emergence of human infections with A(H5N1) viruses in Cambodia was reported in February 2023. Since this re-emergence, Cambodia has reported 27 cases of laboratory confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) including 12 fatalities (CFR 44%).  The cases have been reported from eight provinces: Kampong Cham (1), Kampong Speu (1), Kampot (3), Kratie (3), Prey Veng (6), Svay Rieng (4), Siem Reap (5), Takeo (4). 

**Epidemiology**

Animal influenza viruses typically circulate within animal populations, but some have the potential to infect humans. Human infections are predominantly acquired through direct contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated environments. Based on the original host species, influenza A viruses can be categorized such as avian influenza, swine influenza, and other animal-origin influenza subtypes.

Human infection with avian influenza viruses may result in a spectrum of illness, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe, life-threatening conditions. Clinical manifestations include conjunctivitis, respiratory, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis (brain swelling), and encephalopathy (brain damage). In some cases, asymptomatic infections with the A(H5N1) virus have been reported in individuals with known exposure to infected animals and environments.

A definitive diagnosis of human avian influenza infection requires laboratory confirmation. WHO regularly updates its technical guidance on the detection of zoonotic influenza, utilizing molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR. Clinical evidence indicates that certain antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir), have been shown to shorten the duration of viral replication and improve patient outcomes in some cases. This antiviral agent should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset.

**From 2003 to 1 July 2025, 986 cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1), including 473 deaths (CFR 48%), have been reported to WHO from 25 countries. Almost all of these cases have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments. From 2003 to the present, 83 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 49 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] of 59%), have been reported in Cambodia.**

**Risk Assessment**

From 2003 to 1 July 2025, a total of 986 human cases of infection of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported globally to WHO from 25 countries, including this case.  **Almost all of these have been linked to close contact with A(H5N1) infected live or dead birds or mammals, or contaminated environments.** Human infection can cause severe disease with a high mortality rate: of the 986 infections reported globally, there have been 473 deaths (CFR 48%). 

In this event, cases have been reported from seven provinces in 2025. All cases have reported direct exposure to sick/dead poultry. While human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the more likely source of exposure of these cases is infected poultry of contaminated environment.  

**Based on information available at this time, the overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses circulating at the human-animal interface has not changed and remains low. For those occupationally exposed to the virus, such as farm workers, the risk is low to moderate, depending on the measures in place.** Additional cases in persons with exposure to sick/dead poultry is to be expected.

 **The occurrence of sustained human-to-human transmission in this event based on currently available information is currently considered unlikely.** This can, however, change and the risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available. 

Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and animal populations, and serological investigations are critical to update associated risk assessments for public health and promptly adjust risk management measures. 

Current seasonal influenza vaccines are unlikely to protect humans against infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Vaccines against influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed and licensed in some countries. WHO continues to update the list of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), which are selected twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition, and on an ad hoc basis as needed. The list of such CVVs is available on the WHO website, see reference below. In addition, the genetic and antigenic characterization of contemporary animal and zoonotic influenza viruses are published here. 

This risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.

As the Calgary Stampede kicks off, health experts are warning about the risk of measles exposure and are urging parents with babies and unimmunized children — along with other vulnerable Albertans — to sit this one out.

The Stampede attracts travellers from all over Alberta and around the world. **This year organizers expect more than 1.3 million people will attend.**

This annual event comes at a time when the province is battling its worst measles outbreaks in nearly half a century. **As of noon Thursday, 1,179 cases had been reported since the outbreaks began in March.**

""That's a lot of people over 10 days in a concentrated area and that's where the risk factor is,"" said Dr. Sam Wong, president of the section of pediatrics with the Alberta Medical Association.

""If I had an infant child I would be avoiding Stampede and any large gathering like that because I would want to protect my child as much as possible.""

Measles can lead to a number of severe complications including pneumonia, brain inflammation, premature delivery and even death.

[...] 

The University of Calgary's Craig Jenne is also worried about adults and children who are unvaccinated or have just one dose. The vast majority of Alberta's measles cases have been among the unimmunized.

""We do know, simply statistically, that measles will be present on the Stampede grounds,"" said Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the university.

People travelling to Calgary from parts of the province with outbreaks, including the hardest hit south, north and central zones, could bring the virus with them, he said.

""We are still seeing daily exposures in multiple health zones in the province. So measles is still freely transmitting."" [...] ",1lri9mp,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keep-babies-high-risk-albertans-away-from-stampede-due-to-measles-doctors-caution-1.7576448,58

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751486065.0,More measles outbreaks put US total within single digits of modern-day record,"In its weekly update today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 40 more measles cases today, boosting the number of infections this year to 1,267, which is just 8 shy of passing the total in 2019, which was the highest since the disease was eliminated in the country in 2000.

Though the large outbreak in West Texas has slowed substantially, the number of smaller outbreaks and travel-related cases continues to grow. The CDC this week reported 4 more outbreaks, raising the national total to 27. So far this year, 88% of confirmed cases have been linked to outbreaks. For comparison, the United States had 16 outbreaks for all of 2024.

**PAHO reports 29-fold rise in measles cases**

The US measles surge is occurring amid even bigger rises in Canada and Mexico, and all three countries have had large outbreaks fueled by virus spread in Mennonite communities, though health officials warn that outbreaks can affect anywhere pockets of undervaccinated people live. 

In an update on measles in the Americas yesterday, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Canada has confirmed 3,170 cases, 1 of them fatal, and Mexico has recorded 2,597 cases, which includes 9 deaths. Canada has the most cases since the country eliminated the disease in 1998; meanwhile, most of Mexico's cases are centered in Chihuahua state.

Measles cases in the Americas this year are up 29-fold compared to the same period in 2024, PAHO said. For the region, cases began rising in the third week of the year, peaking in late April will infections concentrated in vaccine-hesitant communities in multiple regions of the Americas. The proportion of cases was highest in children in young adults, but the incidence rate was highest in younger children. Thirty percent of patients were unvaccinated, while vaccination status wasn't known for 65%.

**More cases in 4 states**

In other developments, a handful of states reported more cases. Utah, which recently confirmed its first cases that were followed by more related detections, reported two more infections, raising its total to nine.

In Michigan, the Kent County Health Department, located in Grand Rapids, announced a measles case in a young child whose family had recently traveled internationally. It added that the new case marks the county's second case of the year and the 17th to be confirmed in Michigan.

Meanwhile, Florida has reported its third case of the year, involving a young adult from Leon County, home to Tallahassee, who was exposed during travel outside the country in June, according to a local media report that cited the Florida Department of Health.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment today reported 3 more cases, all linked to an outbreak in the southwest of the state that was tied to the large West Texas outbreak.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751462200.0,Man in critical condition with lyssavirus after bat bite,"A northern NSW man is in critical condition in hospital with the first confirmed case of Australian bat lyssavirus in the state.

Lyssavirus is a close relative to the rabies virus. It is transmitted from infected bats to humans when the virus in bat saliva enters the body through a bat bite or scratch, Keira Glasgow, a director in health protection at NSW Health, said:

This is a very tragic situation. The man had been bitten by a bat several months ago and received treatment following the injury. Further investigation is under way to understand whether other exposures or factors played a role in his illness.

We know 118 people required medical assessment after being bitten or scratched by bats in 2024, but this is the first confirmed case of the virus in NSW, and the fourth case in Australia.

It is incredibly rare for the virus to transmit to humans, but once symptoms of lyssavirus start in people who are scratched or bitten by an infected bat, sadly there is no effective treatment.

Glasgow says people should assume any bat could carry the virus, and that “only trained, protected and vaccinated wildlife handlers should interact with bats”:

If you are bitten or scratched by a bat, urgent medical assessment is crucial. You will need to wash the wound thoroughly for 15 minutes right away with soap and water and apply an antiseptic with anti-virus action, such as Betadine, and allow it to dry. You will then require treatment with rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccine.",1lpvlt6,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/02/nsw-storm-weather-forecast-bureau-of-meteorology-queensland-victoria-public-transport-warnings-evacuations-ntwnfb?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-6864b8298f083f4108195acd,80

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751375274.0,Meet the Oropouche virus. It may be visiting your city soon.,"Oropouche virus disease was a relatively rare illness for decades, lurking on the margins of tropical rainforests in the Caribbean and South America.

Sporadic reports of an infection causing fevers, coughs, chills, and body aches emerged among people living near or moving into the jungle. A tiny insect called a midge spreads the disease, and the earliest known case dates back to 1955 in a forest worker near a village called Vega de Oropouche in Trinidad. Since most people who were infected with the virus recovered on their own and since cases were so infrequent, it barely registered as a public health concern.

But a few years ago, something changed.

A major Oropouche fever outbreak beginning in 2023 infected at least 23,000 people across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Peru. It wasn’t just confined to remote wilderness areas but was spreading in metropolises like Rio de Janeiro. In some cases, travelers were infected and then brought the virus home: So far, Oropouche fever has sprung up in the US, Canada, and Europe in people returning from the afflicted region. The outbreak has killed at least five people.

The sudden rise of Oropouche disease startled scientists and health officials. Since its discovery, there have only been around 500,000 known cases. By contrast, there are upwards of 400 million dengue infections each year. It’s likely then that many more Oropouche infections have gone undetected, especially since its symptoms overlap with those from other diseases and there’s little active screening for the virus.

Now, researchers are looking back at the outbreak to try to find out what they missed and what lessons they can apply to get ahead of future epidemics. Oropouche virus is a critical case study in the complicated factors that drive vector-borne diseases. Dynamics like deforestation, urban sprawl, international travel, and gaps in surveillance are converging to drive up the dangers from infections spread by animals.

And as the climate changes, new regions are becoming more hospitable to the blood suckers that spread these diseases, increasing the chances of these seemingly-remote infections making it to the US and getting established. That means more people will face threats from illnesses that they may never have considered before.

“It’s very likely that these public health problems that people before called ‘tropical disease’ are not so tropical anymore and are basically everywhere,” said William de Souza, who studies arboviruses — viruses spread by arthropods like insects — at the University of Kentucky. “Vector-borne disease is not a local problem; this is a global problem.”

The rising specter of Oropouche fever comes at a time when the United States is cutting funding for research at universities, pulling back from studying vector-borne disease threats, and ending collaborations with other countries to limit their risk.

**The Oropouche virus is a classic case study in how humans worsen vector-borne disease**

The Oropouche virus belongs to the family of bunyaviruses. They appear as spheres under a microscope, and they encode their genomes in RNA, rather than DNA as human cells do. RNA viruses tend to have high mutation rates, making it harder to target them with vaccines and increasing the odds of reinfection. Oropuche’s relatives include the viruses behind Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, spread by ticks, and Rift Valley fever, spread by mosquitoes.

Oropouche spreads mainly through the bites of a 1- to 3-millimeter-long insect called, appropriately, a biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). Midges are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums in the US, and they breed in damp soil, rotting vegetation, and standing water. Like mosquitoes, they feed on blood to drive their reproduction, but their minuscule bodies can easily slip through mosquito nets. When a midge bites an infected host, it can pass on the pathogen to a human during a subsequent bite. There’s also evidence that the virus may be sexually transmissible, but no such cases have been documented yet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that male travelers from regions where Oropouche is spreading should not have sex for six weeks if they show symptoms of the disease.

Vector-borne diseases like Oropouche continue to surprise us because there are so many variables that have to align in order to spread them — the pathogens, the vectors, the hosts, and the environment.

Unlike diseases like Covid-19 or influenza, vector-borne illnesses don’t spread directly from person to person. Instead, they require an animal, often arthropods like ticks, midges, and mosquitoes. The range, reproduction, and behavior of these organisms add another confounding factor in the spread of the diseases they carry. Globally, vector-borne diseases account for 17 percent of infectious diseases, leading to more than 700,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization. But not every part of the world is equally vulnerable.

In cooler regions, vector-borne infections are often a minor public health concern, but in countries like Brazil, “it’s at the top,” said Tatiane Moraes de Sousa, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. “Oropouche before 2024 was concentrated just in the Amazon. Last year, we saw the spreading of Oropuche in almost all Brazilian states.”

That gets to the first obstacle in tracking Oropouche: Which animals are the reservoirs for the virus and where are they? So far, researchers have detected the virus in animals including sloths, capuchin monkeys, marmosets, domestic birds, and rodents. These organisms form what’s known as the sylvatic, or forest, cycle of the virus. How the virus jumps between all these animals and which ones are most concerning for people is not known.

Additionally, it may be possible that other insects may be able to carry the Oropouche virus, but it’s not clear whether they can spread it to humans.

The pattern that does emerge is that when people spend more time inside and around the fringes of tropical rainforests, where the animals that harbor the virus and the insects that spread them reside, they’re more likely to get infected. With deforestation and development, more people are moving into areas where the disease naturally spreads.

“This is a classical example of how human behavior can lead to the emergence of a pathogen,” said Natasha Tilston, who studies Oropouche virus at the Indiana University School of Medicine.

People can travel great distances, and as people move back and forth from the wilderness to cities, they can unwittingly carry viruses like Oropouche. If enough of them gather in cities where vectors are present, they can trigger an urban epidemic cycle as the virus travels from person to midge to person. This was likely the pattern in the 2023–24 outbreak in major cities in South America.

It’s also true that more health workers were on guard for Oropouche and thus identified more infections. “The outbreak is probably a combination of one, there are more cases, and two, we’re also looking for a lot more than we did before,” Tilston said, noting that some past outbreaks of dengue may have actually been Oropouche as well.

African health officials are tracking an encouraging decline in some of the region’s most recent mpox hot spots, including Sierra Leone, which over the past few months has reported a surge that came with spread of the clade 2b virus to some West African nations.

At an Africa Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (Africa CDC) briefing on June 26, Yap Boum, PhD, MPH, deputy incident manager for Africa CDC's mpox response, said cases in Sierra Leone made up 41% of mpox cases in Africa the previous week, down from 63% a few weeks ago. 

Though Boum urged caution in interpreting the trends, he said that countries are battling different viral clades, have implemented different measures, and are seeing different social behaviors in the highest-risk populations.

Sierra Leone is still averaging about 500 cases a week, and a high test-positivity rate (91%) suggests that more active surveillance efforts are needed. Boum said that Africa CDC will deploy 200 community health workers to help with active case detection and contact tracing.

A consistent downward trend has also been reported in two other epicenters, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda. Boum said testing remains a challenge in the DRC, where 97.5% of cases are reported from six of the country’s provinces. Uganda’s cases were up a bit, but the area is stabilizing, with no new cases reported from Kampala over the past few weeks.

**Watching a rise in Togo**

Elsewhere, Togo has reported a steady rise in cases over the last 3 weeks that prompted the deployment of an Africa CDC incident-management support team to assist with surveillance, infection prevention and control, and lab capacity.

So far, seven African countries have launched vaccination campaigns, and nearly 700,000 people have been vaccinated so far. Uganda recently received an allocation of nearly 98,000 more doses. Sierra Leone started its second round of vaccination on June 23, focusing on contacts and high-risk groups in hot spots that span the country’s 16 districts.

However, the region is still far short of its goal for mpox vaccine. In April, officials projected the region would need 6.4 million doses over the next 6 months.",1loi8av,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/health-officials-encouraged-recent-trends-africa-s-mpox-outbreaks,10

On Wednesday, the groundhog reportedly bit two people outside of a business at 311 Amwell Road, which is The Landing business complex.

Both people are being treated and they are not Hillsborough residents.

The Hillsborough Health Department recently tested the groundhog, which came back positive for rabies.

""All of NJ is affected by rabies. It is now in the wildlife population. Rabies is a virus that can affect any mammal, and is contagious to humans through a bite (most often), scratch, or open cut/mucous membrane exposure to the virus. The virus lives in the central nervous system fluid and saliva of the affected animal. This infectious fluid must enter the host’s body through an opening put there by a bite, or a scratch, or through exposure of an open cut, or mucous membrane (i.e. rubbing eyes after touching saliva) to the saliva,"" according to the health department.

Rabies is fatal unless treatment is given before symptoms begin. Contact a physician immediately if you or your pets are ever in contact with any wild animal and may be exposed to the rabies virus as described above.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751134390.0,"Many forget the damage done by diseases like whooping cough, measles and rubella. Not these families","SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.

Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.

Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.

“This concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines – because they eliminated the diseases,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “If you’re not familiar with the disease, you don’t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don’t value the vaccine.”

Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves — and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.

Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed – and a longing to spare others from similar pain.

**Getting rubella while pregnant shaped two lives**

With a mother’s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter’s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.

Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque’s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.

“That’s so funny!” Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.

Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90 per cent chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.

Janith recalled knowing “things weren’t right” almost immediately. The baby wouldn’t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn’t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred – evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.

Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.

Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.

Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith’s place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.

Jacque’s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith’s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith’s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.

Janith marvels at Jacque’s sense of humour, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she’s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs “double I love yous” to family, friends and new people she meets.

“When you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn’t know any different,” Janith said.

Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.

“It’s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,” she said. “I know what can happen, and I just don’t want anybody else to go through this.”

**Delaying the measles vaccine can be deadly**

More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.

It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She’d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn’t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen’s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn’t share his sense of urgency.

“It’s not that she was against it,” Tobin said. ”She just thought there was time.”

Then came a measles outbreak. Karen – who Tobin described as a “very endearing, sweet child” who would walk around the house singing – quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.

“She immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,” said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. “We never did get to speak to her again.”

Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt’s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.

The result? Most states are below the 95 per cent vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.

“I’m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,” Tobin said. “I don’t think that they realize how destructive this is.”

**Polio changed a life twice**

One of Lora Duguay’s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.

“I could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,” said Duguay, 68. “They told my parents I would never walk or move again.”

It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Fla., had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.

Given polio’s visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80 per cent to 90 per cent effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.

Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran – albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.

But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn’t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.

One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn’t move her left leg.

After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art “gives me a sense of purpose,” she said.

These days, she can’t hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.

The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine — which is far more effective than earlier versions — that it doesn’t just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. “ Herd immunity ” keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.

**After whooping cough struck, ‘she was gone’**

Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.

Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.

“She loved to have her feet rubbed,” said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. ”She was this perfect baby.”

When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn’t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.

In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout’s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.

Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie’s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.

“Within minutes,” Van Tornhout said, “she was gone.”

Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, “just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.”

Callie’s viewing was held on her original due date – the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn’t gotten their booster shot.

Today, next to the cast of Callie’s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.

“My kids to this day will still look up and say, ‘Hey Callie, how are you?’” said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. “She’s part of all of us every day.”

Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn’t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.

“It’s up to us as adults to protect our children – like, that’s what a parent’s job is,” Van Tornhout said. “I watched my daughter die from something that was preventable … You don’t want to walk in my shoes.”",1lmtg3v,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/many-forget-the-damage-done-by-diseases-like-whooping-cough-measles-and-rubella-not-these-families/,885
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751112869.0,Measles outbreak strikes New Mexico jail as US total climbs,"The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) yesterday said it is investigating a measles outbreak at a correctional facility in Deming, after five detainees tested positive for the virus, as federal officials confirm 13 more cases.

The announcement comes a week after the NMDOH reported that measles had been detected in a wastewater sample collected in June 10 in Deming, hinting that at least one infectious person was undiagnosed. Officials, who have been monitoring wastewater for measles since March, warned that cases in Luna County may be found in the coming days. Luna County is in the southwestern corner of the state.

The 5 new infections push the state's total to 86 cases in eight counties.

Some of New Mexico's measles cases have been linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which began in January and for the past several weeks has been trending downward. Chad Smelser, MD, medical epidemiologist with the NMDOH, said in a statement, ""The cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over.""

Health officials are sending personal protective equipment, test kits, and measles vaccine to the prison, which houses 400 inmates and employs 100 staff. Authorities are also checking the vaccination status of the facility's residents and staff.

**Cases in Utah, Kentucky**

The Utah Department of Health and Human Services yesterday reported two more cases in its outbreak, raising its total to five. The patients include a minor and an adult, and both are state residents, are unvaccinated, and have links to earlier cases. One is a Utah County resident, and the other lives in the southwest health district.

Elsewhere, Kentucky's Todd County announced a measles infection in an adult who had recently traveled internationally.

**US total climbs to 1,227**

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now updating its measles totals on Wednesdays, and on June 25 it reported 13 more cases, putting the national total at 1,227 in 37 states. The nation's cases are just 48 cases shy of passing the record number of cases reported in the 2019 surge, which was the most since measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000.

The number of outbreaks remained at 23, and 89% of the confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks. Of the confirmed case-patients this year, 95% were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. So far, 148 people have been hospitalized, and the number of deaths remains at 3.",1lmle3p,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-outbreak-strikes-new-mexico-jail-us-total-climbs,94
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1751052163.0,WHO adds XFG to SARS-CoV-2 variants under monitoring,"The World Health Organization (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) on June 25 added the XFG to its SARS-CoV-2 variants under monitoring (VUM) list, as global proportions increase rapidly. In its initial risk assessment, the experts said the public health risk is currently low.

XFG is one of many offshoots of the JN.1 subvariant, and the earliest sample was collected at the end of January.  It is a recombinant of LF.7 and LP.8.1.2. Compared to NB.1.8.1, designated as a VUM at the end of May, XFG has some distinct mutations in the spike protein, but also some overlap. Two of the spike mutations are linked to evasion of class 1/2 antibodies. 

Experiments with pseudoviruses show a 1.9-fold reduction in neutralization compared to LP.8.1.1. Studies involving vaccinated mice showed similar or modestly lower neutralizing antibodies against XFG compared to KP.2 or LP.8.1 antigens.

**Proportions highest in Southeast Asia**

In May, the proportion of XFG viruses rose in all three WHO regions that consistently share SARS-CoV-2 sequences, especially in Southeast Asia. Cases and hospitalizations are rising in countries where XFG proportions are high, but so far there is no sign that infections are more severe.

In the United States, XFG made up 14% of sequenced samples, according to the latest variant proportion update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on data through June 21. 

Overall, the WHO team said XFG seems to have a moderate growth advantage and a low risk of immune escape, though confidence in the assessments are low, owing to recent expansion and low levels of sequencing. Also, only one study has been done to assess antigenicity.",1lm2mvf,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/who-adds-xfg-sars-cov-2-variants-under-monitoring,9
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750959598.0,Kennedy’s vaccine committee endorses preservative-free fall flu shots,"ATLANTA -- The Trump administration’s new vaccine advisers on Thursday endorsed this fall’s flu vaccinations for just about every American but threw in a twist: Only use certain shots free of an ingredient antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.

What is normally a routine step in preparing for the upcoming flu season drew intense scrutiny after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly fired the influential 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.

That seven-member panel bucked another norm Thursday: It deliberated the safety of a preservative used in less than five per cent of U.S. flu vaccinations based on a presentation from an antivaccine group’s former leader -- without allowing the usual public presentation of scientific data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The preservative, thimerosal, has long been used in certain vaccines that come in multi-dose vials, to prevent contamination as each dose is withdrawn. But it has been controversial because it contains a small amount of a particular form of mercury.

Study after study has found no evidence that it causes autism or other harm. Yet since 2001, vaccines used for U.S. children age six years or younger have come in thimerosal-free formulas -- including single-dose flu shots that account for the vast majority of influenza vaccinations.

The panel voted 5-1, with one abstention, that people ages six months and older get a flu vaccination this fall only using single-dose formulas that are thimerosal-free.

“There is still no demonstrable evidence of harm,” one adviser, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist formerly with the National Institutes of Health, said in acknowledging the panel wasn’t following its usual practice of acting on evidence.

But he added that “whether the actual molecule is a risk or not, we have to respect the fear of mercury” that might dissuade some people from getting vaccinated.

The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they’re available.

[...] 

Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion unnecessarily raised doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.

At the panel’s meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.

Her organization, which represents large city health departments, “is deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,” she said. “The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.”",1ll6gk1,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/kennedys-vaccine-committee-endorses-preservative-free-fall-flu-shots/,457

The activity brought together technical teams from Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti and Suriname, who reviewed the progress achieved in the 2024-2025 biennium and identified joint priorities for the next period 2026-2027, within the framework of the High Level Implementation Plan III (HLIP III). 

During the opening, Dr. Lilian Reneau, PAHO/WHO Representative in Guatemala, welcomed the delegations and reaffirmed the Organization's commitment to strengthening national systems. ""Pandemic preparedness cannot rest on improvisations. We need evidence-based decisions, supported by data and strengthened by political will,"" she said.

The meeting program was structured around the four key outputs of HLIP III: (1) Policies and Plans, (2) Collaborative Surveillance through GISRS, (3) Community Protection, and (4) Access to Countermeasures. Each block included technical presentations by the PAHO/WHO regional office, presentations of achievements and lessons learned by representatives of the ministries of health of the invited countries, review of work plans and panel discussions among countries.  

In the Policies and Plans component, Guatemala, Colombia and Bolivia presented estimates of medical and economic burden as a basis for decision making. In the area of pandemic preparedness, Colombia, Costa Rica and Guyana presented their strategies for updating national plans and strengthening technical capacities. Regarding influenza preparedness policies, the experiences of Guyana and Guatemala were highlighted, particularly in relation to vaccination programs and regulatory frameworks. 

In the area of collaborative surveillance through GISRS, Belize and Haiti shared progress in strengthening their national laboratories. In turn, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Suriname presented their approaches to integrate and strengthen respiratory virus surveillance, both through sentinel surveillance and event-based surveillance. 

Within the component on Community Protection and Risk Communication, Costa Rica, Belize and Bolivia shared their experiences in the formulation of national risk communication strategies for respiratory threats. 

Finally, in the Access to Countermeasures axis, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Guatemala presented their experiences in reviewing and updating National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDVP), identifying good practices and areas for improvement to ensure equitable access to vaccines and other essential tools. 

At the end of each session, participants had the opportunity to review their work plans for the next biennium, integrating the experiences of other countries.

PAHO/WHO closed the meeting reiterating that this regional meeting represents a strategic platform to promote technical cooperation among countries, facilitate the exchange of experiences, and consolidate sustainable mechanisms for equitable and effective preparedness for influenza threats in the Americas region.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750876573.0,Scientists raise ‘urgent concerns’ over new bat viruses found in China,"Researchers have raised “urgent concerns” after discovering two new bat viruses in China with the potential to infect humans and cause severe brain inflammation and respiratory disease.

The viruses, along with multiple new bacteria and parasite species, were discovered in bats inhabiting orchards in southwestern China’s Yunnan province, according to a study published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS Pathogens. 

These viruses are closely related to the deadly Nipah and Hendra pathogens, which cause severe brain inflammation and respiratory disease in humans, according to researchers, including from the Yunnan Institute of Endemic Disease Control and Prevention.

Nipah is a lethal pathogen known to cause severe disease in humans, including acute respiratory distress with a high mortality rate of 35-75 per cent.

The Hendra virus has been responsible for multiple fatal outbreaks in humans and horses.

“These viruses are naturally hosted by fruit bats and are typically transmitted to humans through bat urine or saliva, often via contamination of food sources,” researchers said.

The study raises concerns about the potential for similar new viruses to spread from bats to livestock or humans in the region.

“This finding is particularly significant as Yunnan province is a recognised hotspot for bat diversity,” it notes.

Due to their unique immune systems, bats are a natural reservoir for a wide range of microorganisms, including notable pathogens transmitted to humans.

While the exact origins of the Covid-19 pandemic remain unclear, numerous studies suggest horseshoe bats as one of the most likely host candidates from which the novel coronavirus jumped to humans.

However, the complete array of viruses, fungi, bacteria and parasites that infect bats remains unknown as most previous studies have focused on faeces from the flying mammal alone without inspecting the organs.

**The latest study peered inside the kidneys of 142 bats from 10 species, which were collected over four years across five areas of Yunnan. Genome sequencing of the samples revealed 22 viruses, of which 20 are new to science. Two of these were henipaviruses, the same genus as Nipah and Hendra, which have had high fatality rates in humans in previous epidemic outbreaks.**

Since these viruses can potentially spread through urine, scientists raise concerns about the risk of these pathogens jumping to humans or livestock via contaminated fruit from the orchards.

The findings underscore the need for a multi-organ screening approach to understand the microbial diversity harboured by bats.

Scientists call for “comprehensive, full-spectrum microbial analyses of previously understudied organs to better assess spillover risks from bat populations”.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750874976.0,"RFK Jr.’s new CDC advisers to study childhood vaccination schedule, guidelines for hepatitis B, measles shots","At the first meeting of a controversial new group of vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the committee announced new plans to study established vaccine guidelines.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will create new work groups to study the cumulative effects of the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedules, the hepatitis B vaccine dose given at birth and the combination measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine, new chair Dr. Martin Kulldorff announced at Wednesday’s meeting in Atlanta.

It was the first time the new group of seven outside CDC vaccine advisers has convened since US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed the previous panel of 17 experts this month, claiming that they had conflicts of interest. He appointed a new group of eight members two days later; one withdrew during the financial holdings review, leaving seven to review the nation’s vaccine recommendations. 

Public health experts were concerned about both the unprecedented dismissal of the previous committee and the background and positions of some of the new advisers; two have served as expert witnesses against vaccines in trials, and another has suggested, against evidence, that Covid-19 vaccines contributed to the deaths of young people and should be removed from the market.

Kennedy, who helmed the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense before becoming HHS secretary, has suggested that childhood vaccines have been inadequately studied, something pediatricians and infectious disease experts say is not the case.

Kulldorff said the new work group on the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedules will review “interaction effects between different vaccines, cumulative amounts of vaccine ingredients and the relative timing of different vaccines.”

Each time a vaccine is added to the schedule, its interaction with other vaccines is reviewed, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of an outside vaccine advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration.

“You have to prove that your vaccine doesn’t interfere with the safety or immunogenicity profile of existing vaccines and vice versa,” he told CNN on Wednesday.

Offit said the plans from the new committee are “just a purely anti-vaccine agenda springing to life in public policy.”

A second new work group will look at vaccines that haven’t been reviewed in more than seven years, Kulldorff said, including whether the hepatitis B vaccine should be universally recommended for newborns.

“Unless the mother is hepatitis B-positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” Kulldorff said.

The CDC says that “universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to [hepatitis B]-positive mothers not identified prenatally.”

“Scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the safety of hepatitis B vaccines,” the agency says.

The American Academy of Pediatrics said on social media on Wednesday that “Hepatitis B can be passed from parent to baby at birth - and when that happens, the consequences can be deadly. It is unscientific and dangerous to ignore the success of US vaccination programs or argue that the US should not vaccinate babies for hepatitis B at birth.”

When the universal birth dose recommendation was temporarily suspended in 1999, some confusion ensued, and about 10% of hospitals suspended all birth doses regardless of infants’ degree of risk, Offit wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007. “One 3-month-old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection,” he said.

A third new work group will look at vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, or varicella, Kulldorff said, noting that “vaccines are important for combating measles for the first dose at age 12 to 15 months.” [...] 

Kulldorff said that the committee may reevaluate the combination vaccine recommendation for 1-year-olds and that the working group may look at the optimal timing of the vaccine and potential alternatives, such as one used in Japan.

Measles vaccination rates have been declining in the US, and more than 1,200 cases have been reported this year, among the most since the disease was declared eliminated in the US in the year 2000. Two school-age children have died in an outbreak centered in West Texas, and one adult died in New Mexico. All were unvaccinated.

The ACIP’s recommendations historically have held significant sway; they influence both insurance coverage and state policies around vaccination.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750787180.0,"Cassidy, in Break With Kennedy, Calls for Vaccine Meeting Delay","The chairman of the Senate health committee, in his first significant break with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has called for a delay in this week’s meeting of a panel of vaccine advisers, saying the group Mr. Kennedy appointed lacks the experience and diversity of opinion necessary to ensure public faith in its recommendations.

The chairman, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, made his comments in a social media post on Monday night. Mr. Cassidy, a physician and a strong proponent of vaccines, voted reluctantly to confirm Mr. Kennedy after announcing that the secretary had agreed to consult with him on significant matters and not to disband the advisory committee. The senator has carefully parsed his words about Mr. Kennedy.

“Although the appointees to ACIP have scientific credentials, many do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology,” Mr. Cassidy wrote, using the acronym for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“In particular,” Mr. Cassidy added, “some lack experience studying new technologies such as mRNA vaccines, and may even have a preconceived bias against them.”

Mr. Kennedy, who has complained that committee members he fired were too close to the drug industry, defended the dismissals on Tuesday when he appeared before a House subcommittee to defend a budget blueprint for his department that called for major cuts. The health secretary called the old panel “a template for medical malpractice” during a fiery clash with Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey.

He then accused Mr. Pallone of being influenced by drug industry contributions to his campaigns, saying the lawmaker’s “enthusiasm” for the previous panel seemed to be “an outcome of those contributions.

After an outcry from Mr. Pallone’s fellow Democratic lawmakers, the subcommittee chairman forced Mr. Kennedy to retract his words.

The upcoming meeting of the advisory committee, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, is drawing scrutiny from vaccine experts because it includes a discussion of thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that was removed from most childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure more than two decades ago amid suspicion from vaccine critics, including Mr. Kennedy, that it was linked to autism. No link has been found.

[...] 

The mass firing appeared to catch Mr. Cassidy off guard. After the announcement, he expressed his concerns on social media: “Of course, now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion. I’ve just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I’ll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case.”

The advisory committee wields enormous influence, carefully reviewing data about vaccines and making recommendations about who should get them and when. It ordinarily takes months to prepare for its meetings; the newly constituted panel has had only two weeks to do so.

A senior C.D.C. expert on vaccine policy who was scheduled to present evidence to the committee quit in frustration last week, warning that “a lot of Americans are going to die” if Mr. Kennedy’s moves were not reversed.

In calling for a delay, Mr. Cassidy wrote: “The meeting should be delayed until the panel is fully staffed with more robust and balanced representation — as required by law — including those with more direct relevant expertise. Otherwise, ACIP’s recommendations could be viewed with skepticism, which will work against the success of this Administration’s efforts.”

There was no indication that the health secretary would heed Mr. Cassidy’s urging. Mr. Kennedy said when he fired the panel that the move was necessary to restore trust in vaccines.

The agenda for the two-day advisory committee meeting includes discussion of vaccines against Covid-19; respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V.; influenza; anthrax; and chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that is not often seen in the United States. Last month, Mr. Kennedy created an uproar when he announced on his own that Covid shots would be removed from the C.D.C. schedule of vaccines for children; the agency later said children could have the vaccines after consulting with a health professional.

The Vaccine Integrity Project, a new initiative at the University of Minnesota to counter vaccine misinformation, noted in a blog post on Monday that, despite a widening measles outbreak, the committee’s agenda did not include a discussion of the benefits of measles vaccination.

“Additionally,” the blog post said, “this will be the first meeting with presentations that C.D.C. subject matter experts did not vet. Their eyes haven’t touched the scheduled presentations on the flu vaccine and thimerosal, which Redwood is slated to give, or the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (M.M.R.V.) vaccine. These are clear signs that the true intent of the meeting is to sow distrust about the safety of vaccines.”",1ljhstz,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/cassidy-kennedy-vaccine-committee.html,113

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750715416.0,Former leader of anti-vaccine group founded by RFK Jr. to present at first meeting of new CDC vaccine advisers,"
A former leader of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense will present this week on thimerosal in flu vaccines at a meeting of the newly appointed vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a CDC official with knowledge of the decision who wasn’t authorized to reveal the information.

The presenter, Lyn Redwood, is a nurse practitioner with experience in pediatrics and family medicine, according to a bio posted on Children’s Health Defense’s website, which notes she is president emerita of the organization. She previously served as president of the World Mercury Project in 2016, which “expanded its mission” two years later to become Children’s Health Defense, which was founded by current US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Thimerosal is a preservative used in vaccines to prevent microbial growth, but it was removed from most shots decades ago because of concerns that it contains a form of mercury. Subsequent studies showed thimerosal - which contains ethylmercury, a form that’s cleared from the body much more quickly than methylmercury, the kind found in some fish - wasn’t linked to neurodevelopmental issues, including autism. Nonetheless, it became a key focus of groups, like Children’s Health Defense, that argue vaccines are linked to autism.

The addition of a discussion and vote at this week’s meeting on thimerosal in flu vaccines — it’s still included in some multidose vial forms — led to concerns from the public health community that those debunked links would be brought up again, after Kennedy dismissed all 17 former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with eight new members. Two of the new members served as expert witnesses in trials against vaccine makers, and a third claims, against evidence, that Covid-19 vaccines contributed to the deaths of young people.

Most flu vaccines given to children now come in single-dose vials or prefilled syringes that don’t contain thimerosal. Some multidose vials, which account for about 4% of the flu vaccines given in the US, still contain it.

Experts said they found the inclusion of the topic on the ACIP agenda puzzling. 

“I actually don’t know any pediatric practices that even use that multidose influenza vaccine,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Colorado and liaison to ACIP for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Redwood’s scheduled presentation to the CDC vaccine advisory committee is unusual. Typically, presenters are members of the ACIP working groups who have spent months gathering and discussing evidence on a given topic. The vote on thimerosal was added days ago, and it’s not clear what the discussion and vote on thimerosal in flu vaccines will entail. 

Redwood declined to comment to CNN about her upcoming presentation.

Redwood’s history with vaccines appears thoroughly intertwined with concerns about the safety of thimerosal and ties to neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, which multiple studies have since determined are not linked. In 1999, Children’s Health Defense notes, Redwood “calculated that her son had received 125 times the EPA Federal Safety guidelines for safe mercury exposure from his infant vaccines resulting in a diagnosis of autism.” Redwood has since coauthored papers and testified before Congress about the issue.

“She has a clear history of bias and likely conflicts of interest here,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco, whose research focuses on legal and policy issues related to vaccines.

HHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Redwood’s presentation.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750702743.0,"Europe: Thousands Sickened, 9 Killed from Hepatitis A at 4 Popular Holiday Destinations","An urgent travel warning has been issued for four popular European vacation hotspots due to a virus outbreak that’s sickened thousands and caused nine reported deaths.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has reported a “significant increase” in hepatitis A infections in Austria, Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia between January and May 2025, with cases totaling 2,097.

Hepatitis A, the Mayo Clinic explains, is a “highly contagious” liver infection caused by a virus which ""spreads when infected stool, even just tiny amounts, enters the mouth of another person (fecal-oral transmission).""

Transmission sources include consuming food or water that’s contaminated or has been prepared by someone with the virus who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.

The virus is durable, and can stay alive on surfaces “for a few months.” It can also spread by eating raw shellfish from sewage-contaminated water.

Slovakia — whose lakeside resorts are popular vacation destinations — has a recorded 880 cases so far this year;  Hungary has reported 530 cases, largely among adults. While Austria has only 87 confirmed cases, the country has also reported three deaths.

The outbreak has been the most devastating in Czechia, where six have died; The ECDC reports that “young children [are] the most affected group.” 

Although Germany is not considered a part of the outbreak, the agency did note that three cases have been identified which match the profiles of cases in Hungary and Austria. The ECDC says the outbreak is largely spreading via “person-to-person transmission within connected social networks or geographical areas, rather than multiple unrelated outbreaks.”

“Circulation of the virus is high among people living in poor sanitary conditions, people who inject drugs, and people experiencing homelessness,” the agency says.   

Responding to the outbreaks, Czech Republic's state health institute director and chief hygienist Dr. Barbora Macková said, “In the current epidemiological situation, we recommend getting vaccinated before the start of holidays and vacations,” per The Daily Mail.

Not everyone who gets infected will get sick, the Mayo Clinic notes, adding that symptoms may start weeks after infection.

These include the hallmark symptoms like jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes), abdominal pain that’s focused on the right side of the stomach — near the liver — and dark urine. Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) can accompany the virus, as well as fever and fatigue.

Getting the hepatitis A vaccine within two weeks of suspected exposure may help prevent sickness.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750693104.0,"With AI, Researchers Find Increasing Immune Evasion in H5N1","​Los Angeles, Calif.—The H5N1 avian influenza virus has infected birds and mammals around the world. As of June 2025, 70 people have been infected, and 1 person has died in the United States. A new analysis suggests that the virus is evolving clever strategies. Using artificial intelligence tools, researchers at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) analyzed thousands of viral proteins and found that their bonds to protective antibodies have weakened over time.

Newer versions of the virus have improved their ability to evade the natural defenses of the human immune system. “The virus has certainly mutated away from what we saw a decade ago,” said UNCC computational biologist Colby T. Ford, Ph.D., who led the study. “They don't even look the same.”

These adaptations increase the pandemic potential of the virus, he said, and candidate vaccines developed 10 years ago may not be efficacious against the contemporary strains of the virus. “This has the potential to be bad.”​",1liju5o,"https://asm.org/press-releases/2025/june/with-ai,-researchers-find-increasing-immune-evasio",56
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750682561.0,WHO Reports 6th H10N3 Case & 3 Additional H9N2 Cases In China,"Over the past 6 months China has reported 16 H9N2 cases and 2 H10N3 cases, spread across 8 Provinces (see last May's HKCHP Reports 1 New H10N3 Case from the Mainland & 8 H9N2 Cases).  

While China has reported roughly 130 (mostly mild) H9N2 cases in the past decade, only 5 H10N3 cases had been reported to that date, the first being in July of 2021.

Given that many influenza cases are never hospitalized (and subsequently tested for novel flu), both of these numbers are presumed to significantly underrepresent the true burden from these zoonotic flu infections. 

Today's WHO WPRO Avian Influenza Weekly Update Number 1002 carries brief reports (excerpts below) on 3 additional H9N2 cases and a 6th H10N3 case, all from mainland China. After which, we'll take a deeper look at the concerns over the recent rise of both viruses. 

From 13 to 19 June 2025, three new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. 

>The first case is a 52-year-old female from Zhoukou City, Henan Province, China, with onset of symptoms on 10 May 2025. The case was admitted to the hospital due to severe pneumonia on 12 May. Antiviral treatment was initiated, and she made a full recovery and was discharged on 23 May. 

>The second case is a six-year-old male from Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China, with onset of symptoms on 14 May. His clinical status was mild. 

>The third case is a 72-year-old female from Hengyang City, Hunan Province, China. She had onset of symptoms on 14 May 2025 and was hospitalized on 17 May 2025, due to her age, high fever and preexisting medical conditions. With antiviral treatment, the patient recovered and was discharged on 24 May. 

**All three cases had poultry exposure**, and all identified close contacts of the three cases completed 10 days of health monitoring, with no illness reported and no epidemiological link has been identified between the cases.

Since December 2015, a total of 133 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2), including two deaths (both with underlying conditions), have been reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. Of these, 130 were reported from China, two were reported from Cambodia, and one was reported from Viet Nam.

From 13 to 19 June 2025, one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) virus was reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. 

>The case, reported from Shaanxi Province, China, is a 70-year-old female farmer. While in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, she developed symptoms including fever and chest tightness on 21 April 2025.

Her condition worsened and she was admitted to a hospital in Inner Mongolia with severe pneumonia on 25 April, then she was transferred to another hospital in Shaanxi Province. The case is still under treatment, and her condition is currently stable and improving. Close contacts were identified and all tested negative for influenza A and remained asymptomatic during the monitoring period.

To date, six cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) have been reported globally. Most previously reported human infections with avian influenza viruses were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. [...] 

While most of the (now 6) known H10N3 cases have produced severe illness, we have no idea how many mild, or subclinical, infections may have gone unreported.  

We continue to see cautionary reports, however, from Chinese researchers on the human health threat from this emerging subtype. [...] 

H9N2, meanwhile, has been on the ascendent in recent years, although stepped up screening for respiratory diseases in China may account for much of this increase.
 
H9N2  remains poorly controlled in Chinese poultry, despite the use of vaccines (see J. Virus Erad.: Ineffective Control Of LPAI H9N2 By Inactivated Poultry Vaccines - China), which has led to the creation and spread of numerous genotypes.

H9N2 also readily reassorts with, and often enhances, other novel influenza viruses (including H7N9, H5N1, and H5N6), making it an important viral co-conspirator (see Vet. Sci.: The Multifaceted Zoonotic Risk of H9N2 Avian Influenza).

While LPAI H9N2 is admittedly not at the very top of our list of pandemic concerns, the CDC has 2 different lineages (A(H9N2) G1 and A(H9N2) Y280) on their short list of influenza viruses with zoonotic potential (see CDC IRAT SCORE), and several candidate vaccines have been developed.

A recent review of H9N2's potential can be found at Nature: Genetic diversity of H9N2 avian influenza viruses in poultry across China and implications for zoonotic transmission.

Which is why continued reports of cases in China (and elsewhere) are worthy of our attention.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750447823.0,"US adds 17 more measles cases as Georgia, Iowa report new infections","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 17 more measles cases today in its weekly update, bringing its total for the year to 1,214 confirmed cases from 36 jurisdictions.

Although measles cases have slowed since peaking in late March, the uptick in cases brings the country closer to surpassing the 1,274 cases reported in 2019, which to date is the highest number reported in a single year since the disease was eliminated from the United States in 2020. There were 285 confirmed measles cases in 2024. 

The CDC reported two additional outbreaks (three or more related cases), bringing the 2025 total to 23 outbreaks. Of the 1,214 confirmed US cases, 89% are outbreak associated. Only 16 outbreaks were reported in 2024, with 69% of confirmed cases associated with those outbreaks. The biggest outbreak in 2025 has been in West Texas, which has seen 750 confirmed cases since late January.

Twelve percent of case-patients (146) have been hospitalized, including 21% (72 of 350) of children age 5 and under. Three case-patients have died. Ninety-five percent of cases have been in individuals who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status.

Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, and one dose is 93% effective. Maintaining measles elimination status requires vaccination coverage of 95% or higher. 

But data reported by the CDC last year show that during the 2023-2024 school year, MMR vaccine coverage among US kindergartners fell to 92.7%. And in a recent study published in JAMA, researchers found that MMR vaccination rates have dropped in 78% of US counties since the beginning of the pandemic.

**New cases in Georgia, Iowa**

Among the latest cases to be reported is an unvaccinated person in Georgia who is a family member of a confirmed measles case-patient whose infection occurred in May. It's the second case associated with the index case. The Georgia Department of Health (DPH) said the person was quarantined at home following exposure and that no additional exposures outside the home have occurred.

The case is Georgia's sixth confirmed measles case this year.

""The best protection against measles, mumps, and rubella is the MMR vaccine,"" DPH said in a news release. ""The vaccine is safe and effective."" 

In Iowa, three new measles cases were reported, bringing that state's total for the year to six. The cases occurred in two unvaccinated children, and an unvaccinated adult in Johnson County, according to an update today from Johnson County Public Health. The three case-patients are household contacts of another infected child who was unvaccinated and became infected during international travel.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750419606.0,Ontario’s measles outbreak through the eyes of front-line workers,"Health-care workers battling measles in southern Ontario say they think about the outbreak from the moment they wake until the moment they sleep.


They say treating and tamping down the surge of a disease most have never seen in their lifetime is constant.

Some have even been infected by patients who unwittingly spread the highly infectious illness while seeking help for early but general symptoms — fevers and coughs are common before the telltale rash appears days later.

Measles has spread to more than 3,000 people in Canada this year. More than 2,000 of those infected are in Ontario.

Here’s a look at caregivers on the front lines of an outbreak that has particularly struck a region south and east of London.

“THE UNLUCKY ONES”

Carly Simpson considers herself one of the “unlucky ones.”

Five days after developing a sore throat, body aches and fever, the nurse practitioner gazed at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, stunned to see red splotches all over her body.

“Oh my gosh this is measles,” Simpson gasped.

She said measles never crossed her mind when she first fell ill mid-March, suspecting a more likely cause was her autoimmune disease, ankylosing spondylitis, which leads to chronic pain and inflammation. 

After all, the vast majority of cases had been among the unvaccinated and Simpson said she had been inoculated three times — including a booster in 2015 after a test revealed her previous two shots didn’t lend full immunity.

Simpson said she had been assured at the beginning of the outbreak that three shots would be enough to protect her. She still got sick and was essentially bedridden for days, only mustering enough energy to walk to the bathroom. But she said the rash only lasted a day and never spread to her husband or kids.

“I had a mild case because I’ve been vaccinated,” said Simpson, among five per cent of the outbreak’s cases to involve vaccinated people.

She suspected she was infected by a patient who came to her clinic with virus symptoms a couple of weeks earlier.

Early symptoms can seem like other illnesses until the rash appears, leaving health-care workers who examine them vulnerable to exposure.

“Is this just a common cold? Is it just some viral infection?” she said of the questions that dog caregivers.

Shawn Cowley was unlucky, too. He noticed white spots inside his cheeks in late April, and then a red blotchy rash on his forehead that migrated down his face, and onto his shoulders and arms.

“Fortunately for me, because I was fully vaccinated I didn’t get the full brunt of measles,” he said, explaining that the rash otherwise would have covered his whole body. Still, it took about a week for his body to recover from the exhaustion.

Cowley is a key player in measles containment as head of emergency management and preparedness at the local health unit, Southwestern Public Health. His case was traced to his son’s hockey tournament.

He eventually told his colleagues that he contracted measles but noted there is “a stigma” associated with the illness.

Cowley also felt guilty for going to the grocery store and filling up on gas before he was symptomatic, potentially spreading it to others.

“When you find out you do potentially have measles, and the number of people I’ve exposed, understanding how virulent measles is, that’s a really hard thing to deal with personally because you put other people at risk.”

SLOW BURN

Dr. Erica Van Daalen calls the outbreak a “slow burn” but one that has required close collaboration among local hospitals to safely treat and isolate measles patients.

The chief of staff at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital said she might see one to three patients in the emergency department on an average day, and often they are children.

As of late May, three infected pregnant women had delivered babies and 15 kids had been admitted. Those include young patients transferred from hospitals in Woodstock and Tillsonburg, which don’t have pediatric units.

“It’s a lot of one-on-one bedside nursing,” Van Daalen said in an interview earlier this spring. “When the days are busy, it wears on the nurses.”

Less than seven per cent of Ontario’s cases have ended up in hospital. But the logistics of safely admitting a measles patient is like expert-level Tetris.

Masked patients are ushered through back doors to negative pressure rooms that keep contaminated air from escaping into other areas of the hospital and infecting more people. The room is sealed and has a system that filters and exchanges the air.

Exposure risks are avoided as much as possible, even trips to the bathroom, said Sangavi Thangeswaran, a registered nurse and an infection control practitioner at both Alexandra Hospital Ingersoll and Tillsonburg District Memorial Hospital.

“We ask the patient to stay in there. If they need anything like using the washroom, we try to give them commodes or urinals, just to lessen the exposures,” Thangeswaran said.

There are five negative pressure rooms at Woodstock Hospital. When they’re full, patients are assessed in the ambulance garage, said David Lambie, a charge nurse in Woodstock’s emergency department.

It is an extra layer of logistics to navigate, said Lambie, whose hospital has cared for 108 measles patients since January, 55 of them kids.

Once a patient is well enough for discharge, their negative pressure room is left empty for half-an-hour while contaminated air is expunged. Then it’s deep cleaned for the next patient, said Thangeswaran.

She said each of her Oxford County hospitals initially had just one negative pressure room in each emergency department but as cases swelled they created three more.

As of June 12, her team had cared for 14 measles patients in Ingersoll and 64 in Tillsonburg.

INHERENT CHALLENGE

Van Daalen, of the hospital in St. Thomas, said deciding whether to discharge a kid sick with measles sometimes keeps her up at night.

“You hesitate to send them home because you’re not quite sure how they’re going to land,” she said.

“There are some later-term consequences for kids who have measles. It’s a very rare complication, but we’ll have to keep our surveillance up.”

Dr. Ninh Tran said he felt like he was approaching burnout in late February.

Ontario’s weekly case count had nearly doubled to 177 over a two-week period ending Feb. 27, with almost half of the overall cases located in his southwestern public health unit.

Pressure was high to trace cases, halt community spread and stop infections. Measles was on his mind every moment of the day and night.

“You could sense a bit of tension and anxiety in all this discussion,” Tran recalled in late May.

“It’s always like a temporary feeling of doubt, fear, anxiety when we see numbers go up and there’s just a lot of things coming right at you,” Tran said of the outbreak’s early days.

“And then you have to step back and say, ‘OK, it’s not going to be helpful if I get stressed because I need to — and other leaders have to — figure out a way to move forward.” [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750447934.0,WHO reports cholera uptick in May,"The number of cholera cases reported in May rose by more than one-third from the previous month, according to the latest update from the World Health Organization.

In its multi-country outbreak report, the WHO said 52,589 new cholera and acute watery diarrhea cases were reported from 17 countries, territories, and areas across three WHO regions in May, representing a 35% increase in cases from April. More than half of the cases were reported from the Eastern Mediterranean Region (28,228), while the African Region reported 24,104 cases and the South-East Asia Region 257 cases. The period also saw 552 cholera-related deaths.

For the year, a total of 211,678 cholera cases and 2,754 deaths have been reported across the three regions. The highest number of cases (117,346) and deaths (2,447) has been in the African Region. Most of the cases in the region are occurring in Sudan, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola—four countries that have been beset by ongoing conflicts, population movement, and damaged water and sanitation infrastructure. African leaders recently agreed on a continental approach to managing cholera outbreaks that mirrors the approach used to combat mpox.

The WHO cautioned that the overall cholera picture remains incomplete due to under-reporting and reporting delays caused by interruption of surveillance activities.

**Multiyear surge in cholera cases**

Cholera cases have been surging globally since 2021, with conflicts, mass displacement, and extreme climate events intensifying outbreaks and severely hampering efforts to contain the highly infectious bacterial disease, which spreads through water and food contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. Cholera causes severe diarrhea and dehydration and can be life-threatening if it goes untreated. 

The WHO said the average stockpile of oral cholera vaccine was 5.7 million doses in May, marking the sixth consecutive month that the monthly average has been above the emergency stockpile level of 5 million doses. The government of Sudan last week launched a 10-day cholera vaccination program in Khartoum State, one of the hot spots on the country's cholera outbreak.",1lgcv7f,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cholera/who-reports-cholera-uptick-may,21

Yvonne Ford, 59, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had light contact with the stray dog while on holiday in February in the North African country.

In a social media post, reported by the Press Association, Mrs Ford's family said she developed a headache two weeks ago and later couldn't ""walk, talk, sleep, swallow"".

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there was no risk to the wider public due to no documented evidence of rabies passing between people.

Mrs Ford was diagnosed at Barnsley Hospital after returning to the UK, the hospital trust confirmed, and was later transferred to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield.

She died on 11 June. An inquest into her death opened in Sheffield on Wednesday.

In the Facebook post, her daughter Robyn Thomson said the family ""is still processing this unimaginable loss"".

""She was scratched very slightly by a puppy in Morocco in February,"" she wrote.

""At the time, she did not think any harm would come of it and didn't think much of it.

She continued: ""Two weeks ago she became ill, starting with a headache and resulted in her losing her ability to walk, talk, sleep, swallow. Resulting in her passing.""

Close contacts of Mrs Ford and health workers were being assessed and offered vaccinations when necessary as a precaution, a UKHSA spokesperson added. [...] 

Ms Thomson added: ""We never thought something like this could happen to someone we love.

""Please take animal bites seriously, vaccinate your pets, and educate those around you.""

Six cases of human rabies connected to animal exposure abroad were reported in the UK between 2000 and 2024.

Rabies is particularly common in Asia and Africa, the UKHSA said, with people visiting affected countries advised to avoid contact with dogs, cats and other animals wherever they can.

The agency also advised people to seek advice about the need for a rabies vaccine before travel.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750337869.0,RFK Jr.'s new vaccine advisors will vote on flu shots containing mercury,"A key, revamped government panel of vaccine advisors appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will soon vote on a shot preservative that contains mercury, which is safely used in some flu jabs but has been incorrectly linked to autism in the past. 

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will hear a presentation about the preservative, called thimerosal, at a planned meeting on June 26. The panel will also vote on “thimerosal-containing vaccine” recommendations, according to a draft agenda for the two-day meeting posted Wednesday. [...] 

It is unclear what will be discussed in the presentation or what exactly the panel will vote on.

Thimerosal has been widely used for decades as a preservative to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in several medicines and vaccines with multiple doses. But its use in approved vaccines has dropped sharply as manufacturers have shifted to single-dose packaging for their shots, which don’t require preservatives. 

Some multi-dose forms of flu vaccines for adults still contain thimerosal, including Sanofi
’s Fluzone and two shots from biotech company CSL Seqirus. All vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger in the U.S. are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA and other health bodies have emphasized that many well-conducted scientific studies have found no link between thimerosal and autism, despite unfounded concerns decades ago about a potential connection.

“The scientific evidence collected over the past 20+ years does not show any evidence of harm, including serious neurodevelopmental disorders, from use of thimerosal in vaccines,” the FDA said on its website.

The new ACIP members will play a significant role in shaping immunization policy in the U.S., as the panel reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts. The committee is also scheduled to review data and vote on other vaccines, including shots for Covid and RSV, during the two-day meeting.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750287703.0,The world's only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV could stop transmission -- if people can get it,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has approved the world’s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions – although it’s unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.

While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot made by Gilead Sciences — a drug called lenacapavir — could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.

“This really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,” said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.

Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what’s called PrEP — regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months — is increasingly important. Lenacapavir’s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.

But upheaval in U.S. healthcare — including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid — and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.

Millett said “gaping holes in the system” in the U.S. and globally “are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people’s bodies but make sure they come back” twice a year to keep up their protection.


Gilead’s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It’s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small “depot” of medication to slowly absorb into the body. People must test negative for HIV before getting their twice-a-year dose, Gilead warned. It only prevents HIV transmission — it doesn’t block other sexually transmitted diseases. Some researchers who helped test the shot advise cold packs to counter injection-site pain.

Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.

Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.

About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner’s knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.

A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.

Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.

“Now I forget that I’m on PrEP because I don’t have to carry around a pill bottle,” said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.

“Men, women, gay, straight – it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,” he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months “is a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you’re taking your pill every day.”

Gilead said the U.S. list price, meaning before insurance, is $28,218 a year, which it called similar to some other PrEP options. The company said it anticipated insurance coverage but also has some financial assistance programs.

Most private insurers are supposed to cover PrEP options without a co-pay although the Supreme Court is considering a case that could overturn that requirement. Congress also is considering huge cuts to Medicaid. And while community health centers still are an option, the Trump administration has largely dismantled HIV prevention work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that would normally get the message to vulnerable populations who’d qualify for the shot, said Carl Schmid of the nonprofit HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.

Schmid worries the shot won’t meet its potential because “we’re basically pulling the rug out of HIV prevention and testing and outreach programs.”

Gilead also has applications pending for the twice-yearly shot in other countries. Last fall, the company signed agreements with six generic drug makers to produce low-cost versions of the shot for 120 poor countries mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Gilead plans to make enough shots to supply 2 million people in those countries, at no profit, until the generics are available, said company senior vice president Dr. Jared Baeten.",1levbms,https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-shot-lenacapavir-gilead-80fb37e2c5ac9b452488d7b86a10d568,168
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750274115.0,States with links to West Texas measles outbreak announce more cases,"In a large measles outbreak centered in West Texas, Texas and other states with linked cases—Kansas and Oklahoma — have reported a few more infections, according to the latest updates from health departments.

In Texas, cases continue a downward trend. Yesterday the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported 6 more cases since its last update on June 10, lifting the outbreak total to 750 across 35 counties. However, the number of counties with ongoing transmission has declined to three, including the original epicenter Gaines, along with Lamar and Lubbock. Of the 750 cases, 707 people were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 22 had received one dose, and 21 had gotten two or more doses.

Like other states, Texas has reported sporadic cases in other counties that aren’t linked to the larger outbreak. So far, the TDSHS has reported 32 such cases, while adding that ongoing investigations might link some to the larger outbreak.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), which is battling an outbreak in the southwestern part of the state, has reported a total of three new cases in its last two updates, two of them linked to the outbreak. The new cases push the state’s overall total to 79, of which 76 are linked to the outbreak across nine counties in the southwestern region. Of those, 70 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination statuses. The majority of cases involve children ages 10 years old and younger.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported one new cases in its outbreak, bringing the state’s overall total to 20, including 17 confirmed and 3 listed as probable. Nineteen people were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, and one had received two more measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) doses.

**New Mexico wastewater detention hints are measles in new county**

New Mexico has also reported cases linked to the West Texas outbreak, and though the health department hasn’t reported any new cases, yesterday it announced that measles has been detected in a wastewater sample collected on June 10 in Deming, located in the central part of the state. 

In a statement, Daniel Sosin, MD, MPH, state epidemiologist at the New Mexico Department of Health, said, “This detection tells us there was at least one person infectious with measles in Deming on June 10 that has gone undiagnosed.” He warned that there may be more cases from Luna County in the coming days. The state has been monitoring wastewater for measles since the middle of March as an early warning system.

**South Dakota expands vaccination following 2 more cases**

In other developments, the South Dakota Department of Health today said following the confirmation of two more measles cases, it is expanding access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine through public vaccination clinics at 11 sites.

The state announced its first case on June 2 and has now reported four cases. Officials said one of the two new patients had visited an urgent care center at Rapid City Medical Center on June 10, which may have exposed people who were at the location.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750169874.0,Mexico: The Ministry of Health confirms five new human cases of screwworm myiasis,"The Ministry of Health has reported five new human infections with screwworm myiasis , the parasitic disease caused by the larvae of the fly Cochliomyia hominivorax that has Mexico on alert. Eleven of the cases are concentrated in Chiapas and two in Campeche, all in adults between 25 and 77 years of age. Four of them have required hospitalization due to the severity of their condition. Authorities continue to monitor the presence of this parasite in animals, while an international commission reviews measures to reopen the border to livestock trade.

The five new infections have occurred in Chiapas. Most have been treated for head or leg wounds. The flies take advantage of cracks in the skin to lay their eggs , which, when they hatch, fall to the ground where they complete their life cycle before becoming flies. In total, there are 13 recorded cases of this parasite in humans in Mexico. Seven have already been discharged after improvement, two are stable with outpatient treatment, and four others are hospitalized. In all of the more severe cases, there is a comorbidity or underlying health condition that aggravated the myiasis, such as suspected HIV, neurological deficit, neoplasia, or skin ulcers.

President Claudia Sheinbaum stated in her press conference this Tuesday that an operation is underway to focus all efforts on checkpoints, filters, and inspections to monitor livestock and identify potential infiltrations of illegal trade, a means of entry of this parasite into the country. ""It could be just one individual who may have been infected, but it is being controlled,"" the president attempted to reassure.

Cattle awaiting export to the United States after imports were suspended due to the detection of screwworms in southern Mexico last May in Chihuahua.

Sheinbaum has announced that an international commission is working on the ground to monitor and prevent the emergence of the screwworm. Representatives from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply have toured key livestock production sites in southern and southeastern Mexico. They seek to implement measures to control and eradicate the parasite, which has hindered Mexican livestock exports .

There are no vaccines or biological products available to control the pest. The World Organization for Animal Health recommends treating affected livestock with insecticides on infested wounds, both to kill larvae and to provide residual protection against further infections. It also notes that strict control of animal movements outside of affected areas is key to containing the parasite.

Mexico's hope for eradicating the screwworm once again rests on sterile male flies. The insects are raised in controlled environments before being released into the wild. When they mate with wild females, they produce infertile eggs, gradually reducing the population and ultimately halting the spread of the pest. Currently, there are two sterile fly dispersal centers in the country preparing to release up to 100 million specimens, one in Tapachula and the other in Tuxtla Gutiérrez.",1ldobob,https://elpais.com/mexico/2025-06-11/la-secretaria-de-salud-confirma-cinco-nuevos-contagios-en-humanos-de-miasis-por-el-gusano-barrenador.html%E2%80%8B,346
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750175194.0,"North Korea’s Pandemic ‘Miracle’ Was a Deadly Lie, Report Says","North Korea has long claimed that it defeated the Covid-19 pandemic without vaccines, losing only 74 lives in what it called “a miracle unprecedented in the world’s public health history.” But a report released on Tuesday said the ​government ​lied and left many of its people to die without proper health care or access to outside help.

As the pandemic raged, the already ​woeful economic and public health conditions of ordinary North Koreans ​rapidly worsened as a result of their government’s efforts, especially in the first two years, to deny that the virus was spreading, according to a report ​compiled by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and the George W. Bush Institute​. Pyongyang’s repeated rejections of international ​help and its draconian crackdown on the movement of people made their suffering worse, the report said.

The authors said their report was based on rare interviews with 100 people inside isolated North Korea — conducted by an outside intermediary that engaged them in “casual, in-person conversations.” Their findings provide a rare glimpse into the scale of human distress inside ​the country during the ​pandemic. One woman interviewed for the report ​said that there were so many deaths in nursing homes in the winter of 2020​ that “there weren’t enough coffins.”

“Deaths and suffering due to suspected Covid-19 cases were widespread in North Korea starting in 2020,” well before ​it ​reported its first outbreak in May 2022​, the report said.

“The government’s negligence was nothing short of abominable​,” it noted.

Citizens had virtually no access to vaccines, no antiviral medications, and minimal supply of personal protective equipment, although they had been available globally for more than a year, ​the report said. Nearly 90 of the 100 interviewees said they had not been tested for Covid. Nearly 40 reported not having received a vaccine during the pandemic. And 92 said they suspected that they or people they knew had been infected, though there was no way to be sure.

Local health officials misreported Covid deaths and diagnoses because of fear of punishment for not aligning with the government’s claim that there were no cases, it said. So did citizens, because reporting that they were sick did not bring help from the government but rather forced detention or even collective lockdowns, either of which would have worsened already-acute food shortages.

“This resulted in a doubling of misinformation whereby the government and citizenry each lied to the other, creating further spread of the pandemic,” the report said. [...] 

The report by the U.S. research groups said that the interviews took place in the second half of 2023 through “an organization that has a successful track record of managing discrete and careful questionnaires in North Korea.” Several nongovernmental groups, some of them run by defectors from the North, gather information through informants inside North Korea.

The interviewees’ accounts could not be independently verified in the famously closed-off country, but the assessment that the North’s government shirked its responsibility echoed findings in a human rights report published by the South Korean government last year.

That report, based on the accounts of recent North Korean defectors, said that when North Korea began vaccinating pockets of its population starting in June 2022, health officials told them to thank Mr. Kim’s generosity because they said the vaccine “cost as much as a cow.”

Mr. Kim’s regime sought to use the pandemic as political propaganda, the report by the two U.S. research institutes also indicated. Interviewees reported that state media reports often emphasized how bad outbreaks were in other countries, while claiming that North Korea was safe thanks to Mr. Kim’s leadership. After finally admitting to an outbreak, North Korea accused South Korea of spreading the virus across the border.

More than one-third of the 100 interviewees still believed that South Korea sent the virus to their country, the report said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750119934.0,Very painful symptom could be a warning sign of new Covid ‘Nimbus’ variant,"A new Covid variant spreading in the UK may be causing one “very painful” symptom, a doctor has warned.

The new Nimbus Covid strain (NB.1.8.1) is now rapidly spreading across the world and is being closely monitored by the World Health Organisation.

Latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed Covid-related hospital admissions have risen by almost 10 per cent, with 947 patients admitted in the week up to 31 May.

Cases have also risen by 6.9 per cent, with 1,211 cases in the week up to 4 June.

Dr Naveed Asif, GP at the London General Practice, warned that this variant has a distinctive symptom, a severe sore throat known as a “razor blade sensation”.

It causes a sharp stabbing pain when you swallow, often at the back of the throat.

Rest, fluids and painkillers are the best remedies for the painful symptom.

Doctor Mohamed Imran Lakhi, told The Mirror: “People commonly report a severe sore throat, persistent fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches, and nasal congestion.

Some also experience digestive issues like nausea or diarrhoea, which isn’t always typical with Covid variants.”

The NHS advises people who think they have Covid to stay at home.

However, vaccines that are currently approved are also effective against this new variant, a World Health Organisation spokesperson said.

“Despite a concurrent increase in cases and hospitalisations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread, current data does not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation,” WHO said.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, one of the deputy directors at UKHSA, said: “You might have seen news or social media conversations about the Covid variant NB.1.8.1, which you might know as the ‘Nimbus variant’.

“NB.1.8.1 has been detected in small numbers in the UK to date, but international data suggests that it is growing as a proportion of all Covid cases.

“Based on the available information so far, however, there is no evidence to suggest that this variant causes more severe disease than previous variants, of that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against it.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1750073595.0,"‘We Are Less Safe, Plain and Simple’","When Donald Trump vowed to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild” on America’s health in October, he meant it. The Health and Human Services secretary has overseen a bloodbath at America’s public health agencies during his brief tenure: More than 2,400 were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control, which currently has no director, and 10,000 at HHS. Though some staff have since been rehired, the widespread cuts, carried out in chaotic and indiscriminate-seeming fashion, have laid siege to some of the agencies’ core functions. 

The DOGE-ified federal government has also canceled or impeded billions of dollars in health grants and cynically frozen crucial funding to institutions like Harvard. RFK Jr. himself has used his powerful perch to cast doubt on the efficacy of vaccines amid a measles outbreak, among other dubious claims. Recently, he fired all members of the esteemed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets recommendations for vaccines nationwide, and replaced them with eight hand-picked members, multiple of whom have expressed anti-vaccine views.

Just how badly has the Trump administration damaged American health care over a mere five months? To get a sense, I spoke with Tom Frieden, who served as the CDC director for almost the entirety of Barack Obama’s presidency. Before that, he was New York City’s health commissioner (he oversaw the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants).

 Since 2017, Frieden has been the president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global organization that combats epidemics and cardiovascular disease and promotes healthy eating. He is also the author of a forthcoming book, The Formula for Better Health: How to Save Millions of Live—Including Your Own.


**RFK Jr. has unilaterally fired all the members of the ACIP and replaced them with eight new people, some of whom are pretty heavily involved in the anti-vax movement. I wanted to get your initial reaction to these new picks. Maybe I’m putting words in your mouth, but were they as bad as you feared?**

I don’t want to speak about the individual rules; I think the broader issue is what ACIP is and why it’s important. ACIP has been a model for evidence-based, transparent, fact-based decisions on who to recommend vaccines to for decades — it’s been around for 60 years. When I was CDC Director for nearly eight years, people came from all over the world to watch the ACIP meetings, because the quality of evidence being presented, the clarity with which it was presented, the openness of discussions, and the involvement of pediatricians and parents and others in the process were truly models of effective policymaking. And that’s why essentially every doctor in America used the ACIP to decide who to recommend vaccines to. That process has been completely upended, and it was upended based on at least two untrue assertions.

The first is that there were terrible conflicts of interest — Secretary Kennedy refers to a 2009 report. I was the recipient of that report when I was CDC director, so I remember it. Secretary Kennedy has portrayed that report as saying that 97 percent of ACIP had severe conflicts of interest. What the report actually showed was that 97 percent had some problem or other with a form they filled out, not that anyone had a conflict of interest. Before I became CDC director, I was on an advisory committee, and I had to fill out that form. It is an incredibly tedious form. It makes your income taxes look easy. If you forget to initial every page, it counts as a lapse, and that’s the kind of administrative problem that was found. It is true that there were problems with the process. For example, the person guiding people to fill out those forms was not as highly trained as they should have been. They were a lower-level staff member.

**Not exactly a conflict of interest, though.**

Right. So this was classic misinformation. There’s a kernel of truth — yes, there was a report and it said there were problems. But when it comes to conflict of interest, there are 17 slots on the ACIP. 16 of those 17 people reported no conflicts of interest. One reported a conflict of interest: a distinguished pediatric infectious disease physician who also happened to do research on vaccines. And so she recused herself from the decisions on those vaccines.

Some federal committees, not at CDC, but at other agencies, take a different view on conflict of interest where they say it’s fine for you to be part of the decision or the discussion as long as you disclose your conflict of interest. That’s never the position CDC has taken, or at least not in recent years, certainly not since I was there. You can’t be part of the discussion if you have even the appearance of a conflict of interest. And we’ve looked at the kind of conflicts that people disclosed, and there are things like they’re on what’s called the Data Safety Monitoring Board, DSMB, which is an independent unit that looks at whether a vaccine trial is being done correctly. And even in that kind of situation, they recuse themselves from discussions. So what was actually a best practice was, with misinformation, skewed to be a problem. Now, does that mean it was perfect? No, of course, you can always be better with conflict of interest.

[...] 

**I’m trying to figure out how worried to be about all this. Do you think the new panel could actually remove vaccines that we all have come to know and trust from the market?**

It’s important to be clear about who does what. The FDA determines that a product is safe and effective. That’s their role. The CDC then determines who should use it, and the biggest impact is on the Vaccines for Children Fund, the VFC. The VFC provides about half of all of the childhood vaccines in this country. If ACIP recommends it, VFC must pay for it. And if ACIP does not recommend it, VFC will not pay for it.

**So they can yank recommendation of, say, the MMR vaccine and then people are on their own. That’s the worst-case scenario?**

You’ll have to pay for it, and the costs are high.
But those vaccines will still exist for people who want them. 

And who can afford them. But it’s not just childhood vaccines, it’s what vaccines to give pregnant women and when. These are really complicated questions. Look, I’m an infectious disease epidemiologist. I was an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer. I did my infectious disease training at Yale. I was the New York City Health Commissioner. I worked on tuberculosis for 10 years. I was the CDC director. And I have trouble with these issues. It’s not that it’s too complicated for anyone to understand. It’s really complicated. So you need someone who really understands the issues.

**Some of these people RFK Jr. appointed are well-credentialed, but I don’t know what that means in terms of expertise.**

There’s a real difference between credentials and expertise. When it comes to interpreting data, it is really important to understand the science behind the data, to understand how it was collected and what it means. Because what we see often, even among people who have MDs and PhDs, is a real misunderstanding of what certain studies mean or what certain studies showed or how they were done. And I’m not sure of how to deal with that problem, because it’s not a question of, “Oh, trust the experts.” That’s not what I’m saying. What I’m saying is if you want to try to understand an issue, you really need to talk to someone who understands it very, very deeply because some of the issues are really quite complex.

Let me get into a related issue about vaccine recommendations that I think is important to understand, which is why recommendations change from time to time. Is that because we made a mistake? Could be. But more often, there are four things that change.

First, the viruses or bacteria change. They evolve, whether it’s Omicron or a new strain of COVID or a flu or even of whooping cough, pertussis. Second is that our vaccines change. We get vaccines that are more effective or less effective or easier to use or harder to use or have different dose schedules. Third is that our immunity changes. 

One of the reasons COVID has become much less deadly is that virtually everyone has immunity either from prior infections or from prior vaccinations or both. And that’s really changed how our bodies interact with the virus. The fourth is there’s more information. One of the things that’s been discussed is the RotaShield vaccination where there was a very serious adverse effect and it was pulled from the market and ACIP stopped recommending it. This was almost 20 years ago. No matter how well you study a vaccine among tens of thousands of people, when millions and millions of people get it, you may see a one in a million side effect.

And so with the changing world, it’s really important that scientists and public health people start their statements with, “Based on what we know today, here’s what we recommend.” And also listen to what people are saying. People say, “I’m the kind of person who doesn’t want to get a vaccine.” You say, “Hey, here are the pros and cons. You decide.”

 [...] 

**Is this something that can even be built back, if a Democrat wins in 2028?**

The only thing irreversible is death. [...]

*Covid-19*

European CDC warned that cases may soon increase due to the Omicron subvariant NB.1.1. This variant also caused waves in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore earlier this year.

Historically, Europe’s waves tend to come before U.S. waves (though we still don’t fully understand why). For now, Covid deaths and emergency department visits in the U.S. remain at record lows, and national wastewater levels are still among the lowest we’ve seen.

I’m keeping my eye on two things:

NB.1.1 accounts for 37% of Covid-19 tests and is growing, as seen below. Once a variant reaches around 50%, metrics tend to reflect a wave.

Early signals may be emerging at a more local level:

Cleveland is seeing spikes in wastewater.

Nevada, Texas, and Louisiana are now at the moderate level in wastewater.

Test positivity, another early indicator, is inching upward in California, Nevada and Arizona.

Of course, these could be random signals, so epidemiologists are monitoring them. I would be very surprised if we did not have a summer wave.

Note: If you’re over the age of 65, it’s still recommended that you get two vaccines per year. This is a great time to get your Covid-19 shot, if you haven’t this spring. You will be well protected if a summer wave does arrive, and then the timing (6 months) will land perfectly (late November) before the winter wave.

*Measles*

We’re on track for the worst measles year in 30 years. Case counts just reached 1,197—closing in on a three-decade record (1274 cases). This is still lower than our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, but noteworthy nonetheless.

In a preventive move, the CDC called on summer camps to diligently check for measles vaccination status and track any cases.

*Whooping cough (pertussis)*

Another vaccine-preventable disease, pertussis, continues to rise rapidly: 13,357 cases this year, surpassing last year’s tally in June. Tragically, two pediatric deaths were just reported in Kentucky. (Neither child nor mother had been vaccinated.)

What’s behind the rise?

Lower vaccination rates. In 2024, only 93% of kindergartners were vaccinated, down from 95% in 2019. That small drop is enough to weaken community protection.

A less durable vaccine. In 1997, the U.S. switched to a newer pertussis vaccine with fewer side effects, but it wanes more quickly and doesn’t fully stop transmission.

Newer vaccines are being developed to provide more durable protection, but they have not yet been released to the market. Until then, everyone needs boosters. (Unfortunately, infection also doesn’t give lifelong protection.)

CDC recommends one dose of vaccine every 10 years for adults after the primary series is completed.

Vaccination in the second or third trimester of every pregnancy is critical.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749937594.0,"New COVID variant NB.1.8.1 could be more than 1 in 3 cases, CDC projects","The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which was linked to a large surge of hospitalizations in parts of Asia, could now make up more than 1 in 3 cases across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected this week.

Last month, the CDC's airport surveillance program had detected cases of the variant in arriving international travelers from several countries. The agency now says that nearly half of the COVID infections detected in that program the last week of May were the NB.1.8.1 variant.

The CDC cautioned that ""precision in the most recent reporting period is low"" for their estimates, meaning the projections carry a wide margin of error. Still, the estimated increase in prevalence in the U.S. highlights the variant's high transmissibility — something experts had warned about as soon as it began spreading in this country. 

""Data indicates that NB.1.8.1 does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, although it appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily. In other words, it is more transmissible,"" Subhash Verma, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, previously told CBS News.

Symptoms of the variant are broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, Verma noted. Typical symptoms include respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.

As health officials continue monitoring the virus, the Trump administration has recently made moves to change access to vaccines for some Americans. 

In May, the Food and Drug Administration said it will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and those with an underlying medical condition, including pregnancy or diabetes, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. 

The decision means many people without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also said last month that he would remove the CDC's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Later that week, however, the CDC said that kids with no underlying health conditions ""may receive"" COVID-19 vaccines.

""Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,"" the CDC says in its new guidance.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749854461.0,"Young adult in the Netherlands dies from measles, health institute confirms","An adult in the Netherlands died this week as a result of a measles infection, Dutch public health institute RIVM announced on Thursday. It was the first person in the country to die from the disease in over two years, and the last time an adult died from the viral infection was many years before that. The death was reported amid long-running concerns about declining vaccination rates.

The person who died this week suffered from a serious immune disorder, the institute said. An investigation into the source of the patient’s infection has not determined where or how the person contracted the virus. Information regarding their age, gender and hometown was not disclosed, though the RIVM did confirm to broadcaster NOS that the individual was a young adult.

“The patient was admitted to the hospital with measles two weeks ago,” the RIVM said. “The effect of a previous vaccination can be greatly reduced in people with a serious immune disorder, such as a congenital immune disorder or a medical treatment that severely suppresses the immune system.

A child died from the viral infection at the RadboudUMC hospital in Nijmegen in March 2023, which was the first measles-related death in the Netherlands since 2019. During the last major outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 and 2014, one 17-year-old girl died from the virus, and over 180 were hospitalised.

Another individual died years later from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. “This is a form of encephalitis caused by measles that only occurs several years after infection,” the RIVM said.

So far this year, a total of 437 confirmed measles cases have been diagnosed in the Netherlands. That was more than double the total of 204 reported all of last year. Roughly 2,800 cases were diagnosed during the last major outbreak, and around 3,300 were reported during the 1999-2000 outbreak.

“This tragic event emphasises the importance of a high vaccination rate,” the RIVM said. It is the only way to offer protection from the virus to children who are not yet at vaccination age, and those with an immune deficiency. “It also shows that measles is not just a childhood disease; it can also have major consequences for vulnerable adults.”

Doctors in the Netherlands have repeatedly raised concerns about faltering child vaccination rates, particularly since the coronavirus pandemic. Data related to the mumps, measles and rubella combination vaccine show that two different municipalities have rates below 60 percent, five more below 70 percent, and nine others below 80 percent.

Amsterdam’s vaccination rate is 83.2 percent, similar to The Hague, and slightly better than Rotterdam. “Over the past 10 years, the vaccination rate has clearly decreased, which means that the disease can now spread more easily again. Especially among people who are not vaccinated and have not had measles before,” the RIVM said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749869954.0,"US measles total approaches 1,200 mark","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today in its weekly measles update reported 29 more cases, bringing the national total to 1,197 cases and coming within 77 cases of matching the total from 2019, which was the most since the disease was eliminated from the country in 2000.

So far, 35 states have reported cases, one more than a week ago, which likely reflects Arizona’s first cases of the year.

Four more outbreaks were reported, bringing the national total to 21. For comparison, the CDC recorded 16 outbreaks for all of 2024. Of measles cases reported this year, 90% have been part of outbreaks. Last year, 69% of the illnesses were related to outbreaks.

School-aged children are the most affected group (37%), followed closely by adults ages 20 and older (33%), and children younger than 5 years old (29%).

**First case reported in Dallas area**

Activity in the West Texas outbreak continues to trend downward, and today there weren’t any new cases related to the event outbreak from Texas, New Mexico, or Oklahoma.

However, Dallas County yesterday reported its first case of the year, a woman in her 20s who is fully vaccinated and doesn’t have a travel history, according to the Dallas Morning News, which cited the county health department.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749870205.0,Alberta to begin charging residents a fee to get the COVID-19 vaccine,"Albertans who want to continue to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus will have to pay out of pocket for it, the province announced late Friday afternoon.

Since December 2020, the federal government had been looking after procuring and buying the vaccines, which the Public Health Agency of Canada said was unique to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other routine immunization programs — which are paid for by provinces and territories.

This year, the COVID-19 vaccine procurement process shifted from a federal role to provincial and territorial procurement process  ahead of the fall 2025 respiratory virus season, to align it with other how other immunizations are delivered for diseases that are endemic around the world, such as the flu.

As a result of the federal change, the Alberta government is passing the cost onto most Albertans who want to be immunized.

Health-care advocates slammed the province’s move.

“Public health decisions should be made based on the best medical evidence available, something sorely lacking in this vaccination strategy. Instead we have a government more interested in pandering to anti-vaccine rhetoric than they are in doing their job to protect the public and our health care system from preventable disease” said Chris Gallaway, executive director of Friends of Medicare.

The opposition NDP echoed the sentiment of the Friends of Medicare.

“It’s cruel for the UCP government to put further financial burdens on Albertans who want to protect their health and their loved ones and not get COVID,” said Sarah Hoffman, the NDP shadow minister of health.

The vaccines will still be covered by the province for select groups of high-risk individuals such as seniors, people who live in congregate living, those with underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised, and Albertans who require social support such as AISH or are homeless.

In addition to adding a fee, in most cases the COVID-19 vaccine will only be available through public health clinics and pharmacies will no longer be administering the vaccine.

While the province said work is underway to determine what the final cost will be per vaccine, it noted the U.S. Center for Disease Control estimates a cost of $110 per vaccine dose.

“The cost to taxpayers for the COVID-19 vaccine should not exceed $49 million, much of which will be offset through cost recovery in phases 3 and 4,” the province said in its news release, explaining the COVID-19 vaccine program will be rolled out in four phases, beginning with the highest-risk groups and gradually expanding to include more Albertans over time. [...] 

In making the announcement on Friday, the government pointed out the U.S. Federal Drug Administration in the United States — which is headed by longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — recently stopped recommending routine COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children.

However, following that announcement, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada said COVID-19 vaccination “remains safe and strongly recommended” during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.

In January, the UCP government released a controversial report that called on the province to halt the use of the COVID-19 vaccine. 

The report was commissioned shortly after Premier Danielle Smith swept to power in late 2022, promising to redress the COVID-19 grievances of her supporters.

However, critics lambasted the report calling it a “a sad document — that lacks significant credibility.”

Instead of encouraging Albertans to be vaccinated, the UCP government advises people to talk to their doctor about “the best course for their needs.”

“If the government was serious about tackling vaccine waste they would get serious about public health, public education and promoting the benefits of a variety of vaccines,” said Gallaway.

Friends of Medicare said Alberta’s low vaccination rates have brought an increase in the prevalence of other avoidable infectious diseases like influenza and RSV.

“This year, Alberta has seen our highest influenza death rates since 2009 and we continue to set historic new records for measles cases in Alberta.”

As of Friday, there were 879 lab-confirmed measles cases in the province.

“We surpassed the 1985 peak of 843 cases of measles in the province with 868 cases. Think of that: the highest numbers seen in 50 years,” Alberta Medical Association president Dr. Shelley Duggan said in a memo on Friday to members.

The province said starting Aug. 11, eligible Albertans will be able to signal their intent to receive the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines by pre-ordering through the Alberta Vaccine Booking System.

After that, they’ll get a text or email reminder to book their immunization appointment in early October.

When Albertans book their immunization appointment for fall/winter 2025-26, the province said they can also pre-order their vaccine for 2026-27.

The province said in the 2023-24 respiratory virus season, a total of just over one million COVID-19 vaccines — 54 per cent of Alberta’s order that year — went unused.

Now that the province is paying to procure vaccines, it said it’s important to better determine how many vaccines are needed to support efforts to minimize waste and control costs.

“Based on the Center for Disease Control costing estimates of $110 per vaccine dose, this means that about $135-million worth of vaccines were never used and were discarded,” the province’s news release said.

“If the UCP government was really interested in eliminating waste and protecting the health of Albertans it would be promoting vaccines,” Hoffman said in her statement.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749823734.0,RFK Jr. Is Barely Even Pretending Anymore,"When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accepted his new position as health secretary, he made a big show of distancing himself from his past life. “News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry,” Kennedy, who has for decades promoted the debunked notion that vaccines cause autism and has baselessly sown doubt over the ability of the U.S. government to vet shots, said at his confirmation hearing in January. “I am neither. I am pro-safety.”

But for all Kennedy’s talk, this week, he did exactly what a person would do if they were trying to undermine the scientific consensus on vaccination in the United States. He abruptly dismissed the entire expert committee that advises the CDC on its nationwide vaccine recommendations—and began to fill the roster with like-minded people ready to cast doubt on the benefits of vaccination.

Like Kennedy, few of these new appointees to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, or ACIP, have openly embraced the notion that they are anti-vaccine. But among them are individuals who have spoken out against COVID vaccines and policies, claimed vaccine injuries for their own children, and falsely linked COVID shots to deaths—or even baselessly accused those vaccines of “causing a form of acquired immunity deficiency syndrome.”

In January, I wrote that remaking the committee in exactly this way would be an especially harmful blow to Americans’ health: Perhaps more than any other body of experts in the U.S., ACIP guides the nation’s future preparedness against infectious disease. By appointing a committee that is poised to legitimize more of his own radical views, Kennedy is giving his skewed version of scientific reality the government’s imprimatur. Whether he will admit to it or not, he is serving the most core goal of the anti-vaccine movement—eroding access to, and trust in, immunization.

In an emailed statement, Health and Human Services Press Secretary Emily G. Hilliard reiterated that “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine—he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” and added that his “evidence-based approach puts accountability and radical transparency first, which will restore trust in our public health system.” (Kennedy, notably, promised Senator Bill Cassidy during his confirmation process that he would maintain ACIP, as Cassidy put it, “without changes.”)
Since the 1960s, ACIP has lent government policy on vaccines the clout of scientific evidence. Its mandate is to convene experts across fields such as infectious disease, immunology, pediatrics, vaccinology, and public health to carefully vet the data on immunizations, weigh their risks and benefits, and vote on recommendations that guide the public on how to use them—who should get vaccines, and when. Those guidelines are then passed to the CDC director, who—with only the rarest of exceptions—accepts that advice wholesale.

“These recommendations are what states look to, what providers look to,” Rupali Limaye, an expert in vaccine behavior at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me. Medicare, for instance, is required to fully cover the vaccines that ACIP recommends; ACIP also determines which vaccines are covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free vaccines for children whose families cannot afford them. The experts who serve on ACIP have the opportunity, more than just about any of their scientific peers, to translate their vaccine rhetoric into reality.

So far, Kennedy has dismissed the 17 people who were serving on ACIP, and filled eight of the newly open slots. Most of the new nominees have an obvious bone to pick with at least some vaccines, especially COVID shots, and have publicly advocated for limiting their use. Among the new members, for instance, is Robert Malone, a controversial physician who has spoken at anti-vaccine events, where he has denounced COVID vaccines and, without evidence, suggested that they can worsen coronavirus infections.

 Another appointee is Vicky Pebsworth, who serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an anti-vaccine nonprofit previously known as Dissatisfied Parents Together. 

A third, Retsef Levi, a health-care-management expert, called for the administration of COVID vaccines to be halted in 2023, and has questioned the shots’ safety, despite a large body of evidence from clinical trials supporting their continued use. Overall, “this is not a list that would increase confidence in vaccine decisions,” Dorit Reiss, a vaccine-policy expert at UC San Francisco, told me. (None of these new ACIP members returned a request for comment.)

The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for the end of this month—and the agenda includes discussion about anthrax vaccines, chikungunya vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, cytomegalovirus vaccine, the human-papillomavirus vaccine, influenza vaccines, the Lyme-disease vaccine, meningococcal vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, and RSV vaccines. That’s a big slate of topics for a brand-new panel of members, Paul Offit, a pediatrician and a vaccine expert who has previously served on ACIP, told me: Depending on how the meeting is structured, and on the input from CDC scientists, these new committee members could substantially alter the guidelines on several immunizations—perhaps so much so that certain shots could stop being recommended to certain groups of Americans.

 Based on the composition of the committee so far, Offit predicts that the new ACIP will eventually push the CDC away from full-throated endorsement of many of these vaccines.

Even subtle changes in the wording of CDC recommendations—a should swapped for a may—can have big ripple effects, Limaye told me. Insurers, for instance, may be more reluctant to cover vaccines that are not actively endorsed by the CDC; some states—especially those in which vaccines have become a political battleground—may stop mandating those types of shots. If the CDC softens its recommendations, “we will likely see more partisan divides” in who opts for protection nationwide, Jason Schwartz, a vaccine-policy expert at Yale, told me. Pharmaceutical companies may, in turn, cut down production of vaccines that don’t have full CDC backing, perpetuating a cycle of reduced availability and reduced enthusiasm. And primary-care physicians, who look to the CDC’s vaccination schedule as an essential reference, may shift the language they use to describe childhood shots, nudging more parents to simply opt out.

[...] 

Identifying as “anti-vaccine” has historically been taboo: In a nation where most people remain largely in favor of shots, the term is pejorative, an open acknowledgment that one’s views lie outside of the norm. But the more vaccine resistance infiltrates HHS and its advisers, the more what’s considered normal may shift toward Kennedy’s own views on vaccines; ACIP’s reputation for evidence-backed thinking could even gild those views with scientific legitimacy. Assembling one’s own team of friendly experts is an especially effective way to sanewash extremism, Reiss told me, and to overturn the system through what appear to be normal channels. If the nation’s most prominent group of vaccine advisers bends toward anti-vaccine, the term loses its extremist edge—and the scientists who argue, based on sound data, that vaccines are safe and effective risk being labeled anti-government.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749761669.0,Study suggests kids with severe COVID-19 have lasting metabolic changes,"A new study based on blood samples from 147 children with or without COVID-19 shows severe COVID infections may cause lasting metabolic changes in children that could impact heart health. The study was published yesterday in the Journal of Proteome Research.

The blood samples included serum taken from children who were hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital for severe COVID infections, including MIS-C (multiple inflammatory syndrome in children), a rare but serious complication that can follow mild to moderate COVID cases. 

Researchers from Harvard University and Murdoch University in Australia collected pediatric serum samples from 66 healthy controls with confirmatory absence of COVID antibodies, 55 participants with positive COVID-19 tests, and 26 participants who had MIS-C following COVID-19 infections. 

Of the 55 children with COVID-19, 32 (58%) were hospitalized during their infection; however, only 14 (25%) presented with severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. Of the kids with MIS-C, 13 (50%) required intensive care unit-level care, seven (24%) required vasopressors for cardiovascular dysfunction, and two (8%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 

**MIS-C patients have metabolic disorder markers**

Samples collected from the children with MIS-C showed marked blood metabolic disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Those alterations were also seen to a lesser extent in children with acute COVID-19, but not in the healthy controls.

Unlike adults, the authors wrote, severe COVID infections led to less lung and respiratory damage among children. But like adults, cardiac and metabolic disturbances suggest the potential for long-term problems, such as long COVID.

“Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children’s metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2,” the authors wrote. “This unfavorable shift toward hypertriglyceridemia during an inflammatory state has previously been reported for both acute COVID-19 infection in adults and children as well as those children diagnosed with MIS-C.”

In a press release from Murdoch University, researchers said the findings add to a growing body of literature on long-term health outcomes for children with COVID-19.

“This research challenges the widespread assumption that children are largely unaffected by COVID-19 based on the relatively mild respiratory effects. However, a minority of children experience a more severe immunologically driven form of the disease (MIS-C) that is associated with longer term GI effects and cardiovascular disease,"" said lead researcher Jeremy Nicholson, PhD, the director of the Australian National Phenome Centre at Murdoch University.

It is unclear now how, taken together, the new advisors will affect vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. But public health experts had expected Kennedy could choose members who share his skepticism of immunization.

Kennedy said his picks include “highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America’s most accomplished physicians.”

But Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s independent panel of vaccine advisers, called some of the new members “anti-vaccine activists.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749576688.0,RFK's reckless firing of CDC vaccine advisors not supported by evidence,"Yesterday, US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the firing of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 

This independent group of experts makes recommendations to the CDC on the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines to control vaccine-preventable diseases and protect our health. 

It's important to note that ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC director must be covered by applicable health plans and are therefore the link to affordable access to vaccines for most Americans.

**Part of a troubling pattern**

Kennedy's rationale, laid out in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, was based on a series of inaccuracies, calling the ACIP ""little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine,"" and made accusations with little actual evidence, claiming it is ""plagued by persistent conflicts of interest."" 

In reality, ACIP frequently makes adjustments to vaccine recommendations based on its regular review of new safety, efficacy, and epidemiologic data. And federal advisory committees are required to deliberate in a public forum for all to see. 

As standard protocol, members must declare conflicts at the start of every meeting and must recuse themselves from matters in which a conflict could influence their actions. The only ""proof"" Kennedy offered on conflicts of interest were oversight reports that investigated activities that occurred at least 18 years ago.

Yesterday's announcement follows a pattern for Kennedy and the agency that he oversees: With no transparency, the little evidence provided in support of policy changes is selective, and data are retrofitted to support decisions that dovetail with Kennedy’s personal views. 

For example, on May 27, in a radical departure from vaccine recommendation protocol (ie, consideration of the advice of independent experts who publicly present the newest scientific evidence), Kennedy rescinded COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women without providing data to support the change. 

More recently, HHS has given a document to Congressional committees to justify the change—the first glimpse of how Kennedy's decision was rendered. 

Unfortunately, once again, politics and ideology appear to have shaped the document.

COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy

For example, the FAQ document claims, ""A number of studies in pregnant women showed higher rates of fetal loss if vaccination was received before 20 weeks of pregnancy.""

The studies it cites say the opposite. 

The first study, published in in 2023 in BJOG, An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, provides data from nearly a quarter of a million pregnant women, over a third of whom were vaccinated. 

The study concludes, ""This population-based cohort study observed no relation between first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and miscarriage, specifically while accounting for the competing risk of induced abortion. This study reiterates the importance of including pregnant women in new vaccine clinical trials and registries, and the rapid dissemination of vaccine safety data."" [...]

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged people to make sure they have done all they can to prevent infections linked to travel after seeing a rise in cases.

New provisional figures from the health body show that there were 702 cases of typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2024 – an 8% rise on the previous year and the highest number ever recorded.

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection and without prompt treatment it can cause serious complications and can be fatal.

It is caused by a salmonella bacteria and usually spread through contaminated food and water.

A free vaccine is available for some patients at their GP surgery before travel, with travellers urged to check the Travel Health Pro website for information before they go abroad.

There is no vaccine for paratyphoid.

Meanwhile the UKHSA said that imported malaria cases remain at “concerning levels” in the UK, despite a slight decrease from the previous year.

There were 1,812 cases diagnosed in 2024.

The number of dengue cases also appears to have decreased.

Dr Philip Veal, consultant in public health at UKHSA, said: “We are seeing high levels of infections such as malaria and typhoid in returning travellers.

“It is important that travellers remain alert and plan ahead of going abroad – even if you’re visiting friends and relatives abroad or it’s somewhere you visit often.

“The Travel Health Pro website has information on how to keep yourself and family healthy, including what vaccines to get, any important medication such as anti-malaria tablets, and how to avoid gastrointestinal infections such as typhoid and hepatitis A.

Kennedy is removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and HHS more broadly. The group reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.

It’s the latest move by Kennedy – a prominent vaccine skeptic – to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at HHS.",1l7fs7z,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-cdc-panel-vaccines.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.google.chrome.ios.OpenExtension,566
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749469592.0,Six infants born with congenital measles in Ontario from unvaccinated mothers,"TORONTO — Ontario’s chief medical officer of health says six infants have been born with congenital measles since an outbreak began last fall, adding they were infected in the womb through mothers who were not vaccinated.

Dr. Kieran Moore says these infants recovered, but their infections could have been prevented if their mothers had been vaccinated and protected from contracting measles.

Congenital measles can result in severe complications, including inflammation of the brain and death.

On Thursday, Moore announced an infant born prematurely and infected with measles died in southwestern Ontario.

He says the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Moore says 40 pregnant people have been infected with measles in Ontario, and only two were vaccinated.

Moore suggests unvaccinated pregnant people isolate if they live in a community with active measles cases. Health officials have reported more than 2,000 cases in the province since the outbreak began in October.

The measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant because it contains a live virus that could theoretically be transmitted to the fetus.

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin within six days if they are exposed to measles.

However, Moore said that message faces hurdles similar to those around vaccine hesitancy.

“Some people, if they don’t want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,” Moore said Friday.

In an editorial published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Dr. Catherine Varner argues pregnant people are “bearing the burden” of Canada’s measles outbreak.

“Pregnant people are often at higher risk than the general population in infectious disease outbreaks. As such, they cannot be an afterthought in preventive strategies and health-care systems’ responses,” Varner writes.

Moore said the vast majority of pregnant people in Ontario are fully vaccinated against measles.

“It’s only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,” he said.

“I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty. You know, to have that level of protection in the face of the risks globally, I think is quite an accomplishment.

“I’d love to have 100 per cent, but we have to work with these communities that have chosen not to be vaccinated, and that is a long and difficult conversation that I think all of our health-care workers are dedicated to having.”

Researchers in Europe, Asia, and Australia assessed the pooled prevalence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms 3 years after infection in observational studies published in 2023 and 2024. The studies, which reported data from 142,171 long-COVID patients aged 36 to 86 years (87% men), were conducted in Bulgaria, China, Japan, Italy, Romania, and the United States. 

All but one study focused on COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 2020; the other involved non-hospitalized patients. The authors reported the findings late last week in the Journal of Medical Virology.

**Increased risk of death at 3 years**

The proportion of COVID-19 survivors reporting one or more persistent symptoms at 3 years was 20% (shortness of breath, 12%; fatigue, 11%; insomnia, 11%; loss of smell or taste, 7% each; and anxiety, 6%). Lingering signs of impaired lung function included poor diffusion capacity (42%) and low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (10%).

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were at increased risk for death at 3 years (incidence rate ratio, 1.29; excess burden per 1,000 persons: 8.16). Death rates were also higher in those with and without neurologic signs at 3 years (58 of 414 [14.0%] and 94/1,196 [7.8%], respectively).

Among both nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients, long COVID contributed 9.6 and 90.0 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,000 people in the third year post-infection, respectively. 

Although long-COVID symptoms in general waned among hospitalized patients over time, a substantial burden of new or persistent symptoms remained at 3 years. Of the eight major observed physiologic clusters (neurologic, mental, pulmonary, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, kidney, gastrointestinal, and metabolic), neurologic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular symptoms were the most prevalent. 

Neurologic symptoms such as impaired memory, dizziness, and peripheral neuropathy were common, along with fatigue, mental conditions such as anxiety and depression, lung signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath and reduced lung function, and cardiovascular complications such as heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms.

""We are unable to report on the pooled prevalence regarding return to work due to lack of adequate data,"" the researchers wrote. ""The need for researchers to report on the proportion of patients with long COVID who have been able to return to their original job 3 years later cannot be overemphasized.""

**Need for multidisciplinary care**

Risk factors for long-term symptoms included older age, more severe COVID-19 and hospitalization, female sex, smoking, substance use, allergy, and underlying medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. 

""Overall, these findings highlight the lasting impact of COVID-19 on mortality and disability up to 3 years after infection, particularly among individuals who required hospitalization and those who experienced neurological complications,"" the study authors wrote. ""The evidence underscores the need for ongoing monitoring, support, and targeted interventions for affected individuals, especially those with severe or complex post-acute presentations."" 

They also noted the similarities with persistent symptoms after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749482478.0,"Covid still quiet, measles, ticks, smoke, EMTALA, and seed oil confusion (via YLE)","Happy Monday! Covid-19 remains mostly quiet (for now), but measles, ticks, and wildfire smoke are ramping up quickly. At the same time, falsehoods are clouding the facts on abortion care and infant formula. Calling this information landscape “confusing” doesn’t quite do it justice.

Let’s break it down.


**First, good news! A new class of antibiotics is here.**

For the first time in nearly 30 years, the FDA has approved a brand-new class of antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections—a breakthrough in the fight against antibiotic resistance. The new drug, Blujepa, works differently than older antibiotics like penicillin or nitrofurantoin, which target cell walls or protein production. Instead, it blocks two enzymes E. coli needs to replicate.

More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, so this new class is promising because bacteria haven’t built up resistance to it. In clinical trials, it cleared infections in up to 58% of cases, slightly outperforming the standard drug (44%). It’s also safe, with mild but some uncomfortable side effects, including diarrhea (16%) and nausea (9%).

It’s expected to be available by the end of the year, though the price hasn’t been disclosed yet. The research was partially funded by BARDA, the federal agency that supports medical countermeasures for public health threats.

**Latest disease trends**

Covid-19 is still quiet overall.
Emergency room visits for Covid-19 are starting to tick up in Hawaii and, if you squint, in places like Florida. YLE has also heard more anecdotal reports lately (sometimes an early signal of a wave), but wastewater levels remain low across most of the country.

That said, the U.S. has had a summer wave every year for the past five years, and other countries are seeing upticks, so we still think one is coming. A newer variant, NB.1.1, was recently detected. Time will tell if it has enough “oomph” to create a wave.

Those over age 65 are still eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine every 6 months. Sticking to that schedule is still a good idea.

**Measles cases continue to pop up.**

The outbreaks in Montana (19 cases and two hospitalizations) and North Dakota (34 total cases and two hospitalizations) continue to grow. Almost all cases are unvaccinated, school-aged children.

With an uptick in travel during summer, more measles cases will come. In Colorado, an infected person on a Turkish Airlines flight is now linked to 7 cases, all in unvaccinated individuals. Four people were passengers on the May 13 flight, and three were infected at the airport. The incubation period for that flight is now over, so hopefully we don’t see many more cases.

The Southwest outbreak has dramatically slowed down, with fewer and fewer cases in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Below is a “bell-shaped curve” showing the deceleration nicely. Measles is likely running out of infection pathways (due to vaccination efforts or people getting infected.)

The U.S. is on track (1,173 cases today) to exceed its 30-year high for measles cases (1,274) within two to three weeks.

**It's the dead middle of tick season.**

Emergency visits for tick bites have reached 107 per 100,000 weekly, but trends are coming down, hopefully for the year.

Not every tick you encounter will give you a disease (depends on several factors), but the highest risk of Lyme disease is in the Northeast and Midwest. To protect against ticks, cover up with light clothing, use an EPA-registered insect repellent, and remember to do a tick check.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749309697.0,Kentucky marks first whooping cough deaths since 2018,"Two Kentucky infants have died of pertussis — commonly known as whooping cough — within the past six months, marking the first deaths from the illness since 2018.

According to a June 6 Cabinet for Health and Family Services news release, neither the mothers nor the babies had received the recommended vaccinations to prevent the illness.

Health officials announced in July 2024 that whooping cough cases had begun increasing in Kentucky to levels not seen in more than a decade. Roughly 540 cases of whooping cough reported in Kentucky in 2024, the highest number of cases in the commonwealth since 2012. Nearly 250 cases have been reported so far in Kentucky in 2025. Officials anticipate cases will continue to increase during the summer and fall, based on historic trends.

Health officials have strongly recommended both adults and children to stay current with their vaccinations as cases continue to rise around the country.

“Anyone can get whooping cough, but infants are at greatest risk for life-threatening illness,” KDPH Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack said in a statement. “Fortunately, when vaccinations are administered to pregnant women, it provides protection to both the mother and the baby.” ",1l5nbb6,https://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/wellness/health/2025/06/06/whooping-cough-outbreak-2-ky-infants-die-mark-first-deaths-since-2018/84074814007/,858
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749297498.0,A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere,"Outside the emergency room of the St Thomas Elgin general hospital, about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto, a large sign with bright yellow block letters issues an urgent warning: “NO MEASLES VAX & FEVER COUGH RASH – STOP – DO NOT ENTER!”

To see such an imperative in the 21st century might have been previously unimaginable for Canada, which in 1998 achieved “elimination status” for measles, meaning the virus is no longer circulating regularly.

Now, however, Canada is at risk of losing that status – mainly because of an explosive outbreak of the highly infectious and sometimes deadly disease in south-western Ontario, where the St Thomas hospital is located.

Since October, the province has reported a staggering 2,009 cases of measles associated with the current outbreak – more than all of those in the United States combined in 2025, and making Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere.

Cases have been climbing by the hundreds over the last month, and three-quarters of cases are in unvaccinated children, according to Public Health Ontario.

This week saw the first fatality from the outbreak: a premature baby who contracted measles in utero from their unvaccinated mother. Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Kieran Moore, said that the infant faced other unrelated medical complications, but confirmed that measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death.

“We have not had a measles outbreak in the community, of this size, for as long as I have practised. Lots of doctors have never seen measles before now,” said Asmaa Hussain, a doctor who is head of paediatrics at the St Thomas Elgin general.

Hussain said that the true scale of the outbreak may be even larger.

“There are likely lots and lots of children and families at home who had measles, who never presented to the hospital,” she said. “The tested cases do not capture even a fraction of what has happened in the community.”

Nearly 40% of cases in Ontario have been reported by the Southwestern Public Health Unit, which services Oxford county, Elgin county and the city of St Thomas, all about a two-hour drive south-west of Toronto.

Shocking though the scale of the outbreak may seem, doctors on the frontline and scientists who study public health say that the return of measles was grimly predictable.

A confluence of antiquated local public health vaccination strategies, sparse access to family doctors, delays in routine immunization due to Covid-19 and a surge in vaccine hesitancy propelled by online misinformation since the pandemic all have contributed to the crisis.

South-western Ontario is also home to populations of close-knit vaccine-hesitant religious communities who are less exposed to public health messaging, such as Mennonites. The current outbreak has been traced to a Mennonite wedding in New Brunswick, from which a guest returned to Ontario with the virus.

Meanwhile, case numbers have also been creeping up in the western province of Alberta, which this week reported a total of 710 confirmed cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1986, when 843 cases were reported.

But the country has dropped below that as first-dose coverage for measles nationally fell from 2019 to 2023, from 90% to 83%, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

In St Thomas, Hussain said that this year she had treated many babies younger than 12 months old with measles. Babies under a year are not eligible for the measles vaccine, and Hussain said that in many cases they are infected by unvaccinated older siblings who have picked up the virus from school.

Hussain also said she had treated an unvaccinated woman who caught the disease from her children before transmitting it to her newborn baby after delivery.

It is illegal to send an unvaccinated child to school in Ontario unless they are immunized against various illnesses, including measles. But, exemptions are possible for valid medical reasons and when vaccination goes against personal religious belief.

Also, when unvaccinated families present with measles at healthcare centres, doctors sometimes struggle to even discuss vaccination with the parents, Hussain said.

“It’s really hard to even approach the conversation. I would ask: ‘How come you aren’t [vaccinated]?’ And they will say: ‘Oh, we’re exempt’ or ‘We’ve had this discussion before and we just don’t want to,’” she said.

Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor at McMaster University in Ontario, said while distrust of vaccines has increased, Canada’s family doctor crisis also precipitated the measles outbreak.

About 20% of Canadians have no family doctor at all, and many more have irregular access to clinicians, so parents do not have easy access to a trusted healthcare professional to discussion vaccinations. Furthermore, the lack of a national vaccine registry means that it can be challenging to know your own vaccination status, she said.

Bowdish also warned that vaccine exemptions were too easily obtained. [...] 

A study by the Angus Reid Institute published at the end of May found that a quarter of Canadians overall do not trust their provincial governments to respond to the measles outbreak adequately. That number was higher in Ontario, at 27%.

That study also found that one in five Canadians with children under 18 are hesitant to vaccinate their children.

Hussain fears that other previously dormant illnesses may return.

Measles, when mild, can be managed by physicians like herself. But an illness like polio could result in more dire consequences, including higher rates of death, she said.

“My worry is about the next outbreak. Because there will be a next one coming, right?” she said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749223620.0,Bat viruses similar to MERS have potential to jump to humans,"A group of bat viruses closely related to the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be one small mutation away from being capable of spilling over into human populations and potentially causing the next pandemic.

A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications examined an understudied group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses—the same viral subgenus that includes MERS-CoV—to better understand how they infect host cells. 

The research team, which included scientists at Washington State University, the California Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina, found that while most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to pose a direct threat to people, one subgroup known as HKU5 possesses concerning traits.

""Merbecoviruses—and HKU5 viruses in particular—really hadn't been looked at much, but our study shows how these viruses infect cells,"" said Michael Letko, a virologist at WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine who helped to spearhead the study. ""What we also found is HKU5 viruses may be only a small step away from being able to spill over into humans.""

During the past two decades, scientists have cataloged the genetic sequences of thousands of viruses in wild animals, but, in most cases, little is known about whether these viruses pose a threat to humans. Letko's lab in WSU's Paul G. Allen School for Global Health focuses on closing that gap and identifying potentially dangerous viruses.

For their most recent study, Letko's team targeted merbecoviruses, which have received limited attention apart from MERS-CoV, a zoonotic coronavirus first noted in 2012 that is transmitted from dromedary camels to humans. It causes severe respiratory disease and has a mortality rate of approximately 34%.

Like other coronaviruses, merbecoviruses rely on a spike protein to bind to receptors and invade host cells. Letko's team used virus-like particles containing only the portion of the spike responsible for binding to receptors and tested their ability to infect cells in the lab.

While most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to be able to infect humans, HKU5 viruses—which have been found across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East—were shown to use a host receptor known as ACE2, the same used by the more well-known SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. One small difference: HKU5 viruses, for now, can only use the ACE2 gene in bats, but do not use the human version nearly as well.

Examining HKU5 viruses found in Asia where their natural host is the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), the researchers demonstrated some mutations in the spike protein that may allow the viruses to bind to ACE2 receptors in other species, including humans.

Researchers on another study that came out earlier this year analyzed one HKU5 virus in China that has already been documented to have jumped into minks, showing there is potential for these viruses to cross species-barriers.

""These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans,"" Letko said. ""While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there—and that makes them worth watching.""

The team also used artificial intelligence to explore the viruses. WSU postdoctoral researcher Victoria Jefferson used a program called AlphaFold 3 to model how the HKU5 spike protein binds to ACE2 at the molecular level, which could help provide a better understanding of how antibodies might block the infection or how the virus could mutate.

Up until this point, such structural analysis required months of lab work and specialized equipment. With AlphaFold, Jefferson generated accurate predictions in minutes. The results matched those recently documented by a research team that used traditional approaches.

Letko noted the study and its methods could be used for future research projects and aid in the development of new vaccines and treatments.",1l4v8z1,https://phys.org/news/2025-06-viruses-similar-mers-potential-humans.html,54
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749233498.0,Analysis shows mpox lurked in Nigeria for 8 years before igniting global 2022 outbreak,"A new gene-tracking study in Nature shows that mpox spread among people in Nigeria for 8 years before it sparked a global outbreak in 2022.

Using genomic tracing, researchers from Nigeria, the United States, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Belgium estimate that the ancestor of the clade 2 mpox virus (mpxv) that ignited an international outbreak beginning in May 2022 first emerged in southern Nigeria in August 2014 and spread to 11 Nigerian states before human infections were detected in 2017. 

In light of the findings, the authors write, ""We need improved surveillance in the wildlife population in the forest systems to better understand the transmission and maintenance of MPXV in animal hosts,"" as well as better human surveillance.

""We could have very easily prevented the 2022 multi-country outbreak if countries in Africa were given better access to therapeutics, vaccines, and surveillance technologies,"" says first author Edyth Parker, PhD, MPhil, a researcher with the Institute of Genomics and Global Health and with the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, in a Scripps Research news release. ""In a vulnerably connected world, we cannot neglect epidemics until they get exported to the Global North.""

**Creating the virus's family tree**

Because the clade 2 virus had an unexpected number of genetic mutations, the authors of the study hypothesized that it might have been circulating in Nigeria much longer than previously thought. So the international team of investigators pooled virus samples and lab methods, generating a genomic dataset three times larger than any previous mpox dataset, according to the release.

The researchers analyzed 118 viral genomes from human mpox cases in Nigeria and Cameroon from 2018 to 2023. All were clade 2b, which is now endemic in West Africa. Just 9 of the samples were from Cameroon.

They found that 105 of the 109 viruses from Nigeria were the result of human-to-human virus spread, with the other 4 caused by zoonotic transmission, or mpox spread from animals to people. In contrast, all 9 cases in Cameroon were the result of zoonotic spillover.

Using a phylogenetic tree created from the genomic analysis, the scientists estimated that the ancestor of outbreak strain emerged in animals in November 2013 in Nigeria and first infected people in southern Nigeria in August 2014. They also showed that southern Nigeria was the main source of subsequent cases of mpox in people, as that is where human-to-human spread was sustained, even though the disease transmitted throughout Nigeria.

**Continual risk of re-emergence'**

""The ongoing zoonotic transmission in the forested border regions of Nigeria and Cameroon identified in this study underscores the continuous risk of MPXV emergence and/or re-emergence,"" the study author wrote. ""Furthermore, this risk is likely still significantly underestimated owing to under-ascertainment of cases and sparse genomic data.""

Parker said, ""Mpox is no longer just a zoonotic virus in Nigeria; this is very much a human virus. But the fact that there's ongoing zoonotic transmission means there's also a continual risk of re-emergence.""

""Global health inequities really impede our ability to control both zoonotic and sustained human transmission,"" she added. ""We cannot continue to neglect either the human epidemics in Africa or the risk of re-emergence—not only does it perpetuate suffering in these regions, it means that inevitably there will be another pandemic.""",1l4zbwc,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/analysis-shows-mpox-lurked-nigeria-8-years-igniting-global-2022-outbreak?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKwDmhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHrKUZU4jLJm1vOgnmeoT7hTx9VfRF9S8iRHnAnCqLeJCIpGKxMVZF2KusGya_aem_gUsioLjRXydfjbGcCeeahQ,22
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749147973.0,Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’,"A cure for HIV could be a step closer after researchers found a new way to force the virus out of hiding inside human cells.

The virus’s ability to conceal itself inside certain white blood cells has been one of the main challenges for scientists looking for a cure. It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.

Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.

It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when it was used in vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.

In a paper published in Nature Communications, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.

Globally, there are almost 40 million people living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.

It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.

The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”

When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.

“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.

“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”

Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.

The three new cases were identified in Pawnee County, which recently reported its first case.",1l3f23f,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/more-measles-cases-linked-domestic-air-travel-us?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKtgRJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHixGzdvC2FCC7kwZEYrZi6_DEuNfCHkETeVgpkTB3uiTv6-YHyJsKGI9FoRo_aem_C2UZQVZuXbFQXaROpmsKhg,223
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1749003005.0,CDC official overseeing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigns,"A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said Tuesday she was resigning from her role overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, following an order by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance.

""My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role,"" Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos wrote in an email to some members of the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Panagiotakopoulos had served as one of the leads of the work group on COVID-19 vaccines within the ACIP. She sent an email to members of the work group early Tuesday morning to say she was resigning, multiple people who received the email confirmed to CBS News. 

Reuters first reported news of her resignation. Panagiotakopoulos and a CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The process to update the CDC's influential vaccine recommendations is closely watched by experts because they are tied to federal policies and programs, including liability protections, vaccines for uninsured children and requirements for insurance coverage. 

The committee had been set to vote on updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines at a meeting later this month, before Kennedy usurped the process to impose his own changes to the guidance.

Earlier this year, members of the work group had signaled they were already leaning toward narrowing the guidance to soften the recommendation for children with no underlying conditions to get vaccinated, in line with how Kennedy's order was ultimately implemented.

But Kennedy's directive also broke with the committee by ordering the agency to exclude pregnant women from its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Pregnant women had been one of the groups that experts had worried were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and warranted continued recommendations to get vaccinated.

""More of us should be resigning in protest,"" one federal health official told CBS News, in response to the news of Panagiotakopoulos leaving her role.

In a statement, the SDDH said the patient visited several public locations while infectious, including an urgent care in Rapid City on May 28 and an urgent care in Sturgis on May 29. 

With summer travel season in full swing, states continue to report travel-linked cases, including Colorado, where at least six cases have been connected to a Turkish Airlines flight and exposure at Denver International Airport.

**A few more cases linked to West Texas outbreak**

Meanwhile, cases in the West Texas outbreak continue a downward trend after a peak in late March. The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported 4 more cases since its last update on May 30, raising the outbreak total to 742 cases.

Over the course of the outbreak, 35 counties have reported, cases linked to the West Texas outbreak, mostly in Gaines County, where the event began. Ongoing transmission, however, is still under way in just 7 counties: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry, and Yoakum.

Texas, like other states, continues to report sporadic cases in other parts of the state that aren't linked to the larger outbreak. Today the TDSHS reported 1 more such case, putting the nonoutbreak total at 33 from 17 counties.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health, which has reported illnesses linked to the West Texas outbreak, today confirmed 1 more measles case, raising the state's total to 18, which include 15 confirmed and 3 listed as probable.

Meanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 2 more cases, including the first form San Juan County, bringing the state’s total to 81. San Juan County is in the far northwestern corner of the state where borders Sandoval County, which now has 6 cases.

**Measles sickens 2 more in Montana**

The Hill County Health Department in Montana yesterday announced that it is investigating two new measles patients, both of whom are contacts of the county's first confirmed case. Both are unvaccinated. 

Health officials warned of potential exposure to the public at a local Walmart on May 23.  On the same day, the health department issued enhanced measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination recommendations for residents and travelers to Hill County owing to the potential for community transmission. It involves early accelerated vaccination for children and an additional MMR dose for adults who have received only one dose.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services said the state has recorded 15 cases in three counties, Flathead, Hill, and Gallatin. Two patients were hospitalized. It added that Hill County is the only location with an enhanced vaccination recommendation.",1l2nmok,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/south-dakota-confirms-first-measles-case-other-states-add-their-totals?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKsRN1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuNX0nddNxkSepdgcJoGs04hrozfhgMclOcRlauAJlqgFv62wdQvZeI_2RlO_aem_pi01w2uHIJGwRrcrUwqBWw,58
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748970860.0,Explosive mpox outbreak in Sierra Leone overwhelms health systems,"Late last year, a young man traveled from Sierra Leone’s bustling capital, Freetown, to the small coastal town of Lungi, where he had sex with a sex worker. Later, he developed a fever and a headache, and then a painful rash erupted across his body, says Jia Kangbai, an epidemiologist at Njala University who interviewed the man. A nurse initially suspected malaria, but after he got back to Freetown, desperately ill, the man was diagnosed with mpox.

His was the first reported case in what soon became a massive mpox outbreak. The small West African country, population about 9 million, has seen more than 3000 cases so far. It now accounts for three-quarters of all new mpox cases in Africa, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention  (Africa CDC).

The epidemic has overwhelmed Sierra Leone’s health system, which only has 60 beds in special treatment centers where mpox patients can be isolated, says Yap Boum, deputy lead of a team set up by the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC  to deal with mpox outbreaks on the continent. It is also shaking up thinking about the two known varieties of mpox.

Researchers from Sierra Leone reported on virological.org on 28 May that the virus belongs to clade IIb, a variant that circulated for several years in Nigeria before it suddenly caused a global outbreak in 2022, primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). It continues to spread in MSM networks in many countries, but at a slower pace.

The variant is behaving very differently in Sierra Leone, however. Its explosive spread, combined with the fact that cases seem evenly split between men and women, initially led some scientists to believe the virus might have undergone changes that make it more transmissible without sexual contact. “The spread of Mpox in Sierra Leone is unlike anything we have ever seen,” Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research, wrote on Bluesky on 22 May. “This could be the next one.”

Other scientists point out that cases were roughly equally divided between men and women in recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbor Burundi. Those were largely driven by sexual transmission. And like those countries, Sierra Leone is seeing many serious cases, including people who have lesions all over their bodies. Those outbreaks, however, were caused by a different variant of the virus, clade Ib. “We are still a bit puzzled by what is going on,” Boum says. “The situation [in Sierra Leone], while it is due to clade IIb, looks like a clade Ib in terms of transmission mode but also clinical features.” A team of 10 epidemiologists will be sent to the country to investigate, he says.

Some researchers say the new outbreak shows clade Ib and IIb may be more similar than previously believed. “I am not yet convinced that there is a significant difference between the two viruses beyond some genetic variations,” says Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Toronto. Instead, local factors may determine how these strains spread and the severity of the disease they cause. “Just because it’s happened one way in one place, doesn’t mean it’s going to happen that same way in another place,” says Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who has studied mpox for decades.

“What we’re seeing in Sierra Leone is a bit of an indicator that in the right circumstances IIb will basically do what Ib does,” adds University of Manitoba virologist Jason Kindrachuk, last author on a preprint posted on medRxiv yesterday that provides details about 161 Sierra Leonean mpox cases. (Kangbai is the first author.) The study strongly suggests sex is the epidemic’s driver: Young adults appear hardest hit, many patients have lesions in the genital area and at least two are sex workers. The fact that more patients seem to have lesions all over their bodies than in other clade IIb outbreaks could be due to factors such as how sick people are before they seek care and are diagnosed, Kindrachuk says, or how common infections such as HIV or syphilis are in the population.

Anderson says he now agrees transmission in Sierra Leone seems linked primarily to sexual networks, but he still worries other, unknown modes of transmission play a role—and that future mpox outbreaks may be even bigger. “Over the next 5-10 years, I think this could very well become a much larger and more global problem,” he says. Kindrachuk fears the disease could spread to Sierra Leone’s neighbors. “We could see very rapid geographic expansion of IIb if we don't really try and get things under control quickly,” he warns. Indeed, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia reported over the weekend that the country is experiencing an mpox surge, with 69 recent cases.

Sierra Leone is ill-prepared to damp down transmission soon.. It received only 61,000 of the 1.3 million doses of mpox vaccine shipped to 11 African countries since late last year. On 28 May, another 50,000 doses were allocated to the country. That’s far too little for a targeted vaccination campaign, which might offer the vaccine to around 200 contacts of every patient, Boum says. “We need more vaccine to get this outbreak under control.”

Update, 2 June, 6:30 p.m.: This story has been updated with new data about Sierra Leone and Liberia.",1l2hktt,https://www.science.org/content/article/explosive-mpox-outbreak-sierra-leone-overwhelms-health-systems,76

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748896716.0,"All international travelers should get measles vaccinations, CDC says","U.S. health officials have changed their advice to international travelers about measles, saying that Americans should be vaccinated against the virus no matter where they're going.

U.S. residents are recommended to get measles-mumps-rubella shots, anyway. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously emphasized the importance of vaccination for travelers going to countries with outbreaks.

Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to call for vaccinations for travelers going to all other countries.

Ashley Darcy-Mahoney, a researcher at George Washington University's nursing school, called the update significant.

A Colorado outbreak last month stemmed from an international flight that landed in Denver, she noted. The CDC travel notice change reflects a recognition that people are not just being exposed to measles in countries where it's spreading, but also in airplanes and during travel, she added.

“We're seeing a shift from localized outbreaks to transmission in transit,” and the CDC seems to be responding to that, Darcy-Mahoney said.

The travel notice advises two doses for all Americans ages 1 and older. An early dose is advised for traveling infants ages 6 months to 11 months.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748876032.0,"Covid summer and confusion, measles, cucumber recall, maternal health declining, and a curious MAHA report (via YLE)","**Covid-19: A summer wave brewing amid a ton of confusion**

A lot is happening in the Covid-19 world. Here are 4 updates for you:

**1. Transmission and a summer wave.** Covid-19 levels in the U.S. remain low—but if history is any guide, that may not last. We’ve seen waves every summer, and cases are rising in parts of the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean.

Waves are started by a number of complex factors, including new variants. Last week, the WHO added a new strain, NB.1.8.1, to its variant monitoring watchlist. This variant is another descendant of Omicron. So far, it has a growth advantage of ~65% (compared to Omicron’s 500% advantage), which means it would cause a wave but not a tsunami.

This may be the one that helps jump-start a summer wave. But while this variant has been detected in the U.S., it’s still at low levels. Time will tell.

**2. Covid vaccine formula for this fall.** Last week, the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee (VRBPAC) recommended not updating the Covid-19 vaccine strain for this fall. That means the same formula from last year will be used again. This aligns with the WHO’s recommendation: though the virus is still mutating, experts concluded the changes aren’t big enough to warrant a new formula yet. This is the first time we aren’t updating the vaccine for fall.

**3. Eligibility for Covid-19 vaccines is a confusing mess from the political ping-pong match.** At first, the political appointee to FDA said one thing in an opinion piece on NEJM, then RFK Jr. said another on X, then the CDC overrode (or negotiated, it’s unclear) what the policy should be by publishing the vaccine schedule.

As of now:

65+ are eligible.

Under 65 with certain health conditions are eligible. (Although this is very unclear right now, and largely depends on how FDA changes the licenses.) BUT (and this is important): Recommendations are self-attestation at pharmacies. This means pharmacists are not permitted to ask for proof of underlying conditions.

Everyone else, including kids and pregnant women, may get the vaccine if they and their clinician agree it’s appropriate (called shared clinical decision-making). This was a really important change that the CDC overrode RFK Jr. on. While there is a legitimate debate around annual boosters, there is clear evidence on the importance of a primary vaccine series for kids and for immunity passed to babies from pregnant mothers.

Note: Insurance may not cover your vaccine under this category. Unfortunately, some payers have a long history of not covering shared clinical decision-making, so I would expect variability in coverage.

Later this month, the official meeting of external expert advisors (ACIP) should clarify things when they meet as scheduled. But this isn’t guaranteed; RFK Jr. could cancel or delay their ability to do this at any moment.

Out of all of this, my biggest concern remains: The damage is already done. A wave of confusion due to unilateral political decision-making instead of established evidence-based processes, resulting in whiplash headlines, likely hurts trust, sows immense confusion, and in turn, reduces vaccine uptake.

**4. Some good news.** FDA approved Moderna’s next-gen Covid-19 vaccine, with three improvements:

Sharper immune response. Instead of the whole spike protein, this vaccine only includes the pieces of the spike protein that change quickly and are the key targets for antibodies (the RBD and NTD). This workaround gets rid of the conserved parts so that the immune system has to pay attention to the parts of spike that change. In clinical trials, the updated vaccine gave better antibody responses and had higher effectiveness than Spikevax, particularly in older adults.

Smaller dose, more supply. The dose needed is much lower (10 vs. 50 micrograms), so we can vaccinate more people with the same amount of vaccine liquid in a vial. Note: The side effect profile for those who react badly to this vaccine (e.g., a fever for a few days) doesn’t change.

Easier storage. It can be stored in standard refrigerators—not ultracold freezers—making it far more accessible in clinics and pharmacies.

It’s unclear when this vaccine will become available because the CDC still needs to approve it.

**Quick measles update**

As of Friday, there are 1,132 confirmed measles cases in the U.S., compared to 1,856 in Mexico and 2,791 in Canada.

West Texas remains the main hotspot, though growth has slowed. Small but growing outbreaks have also been reported in Montana, North Dakota, and Colorado (all currently under 50 cases). Check with local health departments for exposure info.

Last week, CDC updated its travel warning, cautioning that “travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs such as airports and train stations, public transportation like airplanes and trains, tourist attractions, and large, crowded events.” If you’re fully vaccinated, you’re well protected.

**Not-so-cool cucumbers recalled for Salmonella**

Cucumbers across 18 states (see above in the map) were recalled due to Salmonella. Though this was listed on the FDA’s website, its usual alerts didn’t go out, which is unhelpful in empowering consumers to eat safe foods.

Bedner Growers Inc. distributed affected cucumbers between April 29 and May 19. Sixteen people were hospitalized, and 45 people have been known to be infected so far.

If you still have cucumbers in your fridge and don’t know their origin, toss them. The recalled cucumbers should now be off the shelves, so new ones are safe to buy.

**Women’s health: a mixed bag**

Mental health declining: New data show worsening mental health among women—especially mothers.

1 in 12 women now rate their mental health as “fair” or “poor.”

Fewer moms consider their mental health “excellent” compared to before the pandemic.

A step forward in pain management: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists announced its most recent consensus on pain management for in-office IUD procedures. Until now, patients were simply told to “take ibuprofen” for the often excruciating pain of cervical or uterine procedures like IUD insertions. Pain management has also been fraught with racist, misguided, and untrue assumptions that Black women feel less pain.

The new guidelines:

Local anesthetics, such as a paracervical block or lidocaine cream, are recommended as pain management options for IUD insertions and endometrial biopsies.

Clinicians should have upfront, transparent conversations about how pain might occur.

What does it mean to you? If you’re preparing for a procedure, bring these guidelines with you to discuss options with your clinician.

**The MAHA report: what it got right—and missed**

On May 22, the White House released the first Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) report—describing U.S. children as “the sickest generation in American history.” It focused on four main culprits: ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, overuse of technology, and overmedicalization. This was a descriptive report. A strategy to tackle this is expected by August.

What the report got right:

Raised urgent concerns about children’s health.

Emphasized prevention through lifestyle: better nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and less screen time.

Called for systemic reform in programs, agriculture, and industry.

Some red flags:

The report lacked transparency—no authorship or methods were disclosed, despite calls for “radical transparency.”

Social determinants of health, like poverty, were not addressed or acknowledged.

Major contributions to the U.S. lagging life expectancy were left out—such as drug overdose, motor vehicle accidents, and firearms (the leading cause of death for children and teens).

Some sources were made up, and mainstream books and anecdotal quotes were used as evidence—unusual references in health publications and not strong indicators of scientific rigor.

Scientific consensus was consistently undermined, casting insidious broad strokes of doubt on vaccines, medicine, food safety, agricultural practices, and research integrity.

Two big unanswered questions:

How are they going to accomplish this? Funding for these initiatives has been slashed or is on the table to be (e.g., cuts to scientific research, food and health agencies, environmental protection, farm-to-school programs, and SNAP).

Will strategies be grounded in science—or ideology? We should know more in August.

If we truly want to support the health of American children, we need to align science, policy, and regulations by investing in health research, nutrition programs, and agricultur",1l1k3gs,https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-summer-and-confusion-measles,339
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748728519.0,Grieving Indiana mother warns parents after 8-year-old son dies from deadly bacteria,"LOWELL, Ind. — An Indiana mother is using her grief to warn other parents about a bacterial infection that killed her son within hours.

""This is not your typical everyday flu,"" said Ashlee Dahlberg of Haemophilus influenzae, also known as ""H. flu"" or ""Hib.""

Doctors say it's a bacterium – not a virus – and it's extremely deadly. Most children are vaccinated against it when they're babies.

""We later found out that he contracted invasive Hib, which is the more aggressive form of Hib,"" Dahlberg said.

Dahlberg said it all started when her 8-year-old son, Liam, came home from school with a headache in April. By the next morning, he was being rushed to the hospital. Her normally lively child became delirious at some moments.

""They took him to an MRI. That's when they discovered the amount of bacteria that was covering his brain and spinal cord. Basically at that point in time, there was nothing they could do,"" Dahlberg said.

Their lives changed in the blink of an eye.

""I would never wish this kind of pain on my worst enemy ever. It's hard. To have sat there and listened to the doctors say, 'You did everything right, there's just nothing we could do,' to lay there with him as they took him off life support, I can feel his little heartbeat fade away — there's no words that can describe that pain.""

Dr. Eric Yancy is all too familiar with H. flu.

""All the way up to the mid-'70s and early 1980s, it was absolutely devastating. If it didn't kill the children within a very short period of time, it left many of them with significant complications,"" Yancy said.

Complications, Yancy said, pretty much ended when the vaccine was created in 1985. Dahlberg said Liam was vaccinated, but Yancy said the boy most likely contracted H. flu from an unvaccinated person, maybe even another child. 

""We pretty much had it under control, and we pretty much didn't see that many cases of it. Over the last few years, the immunization rates have continued to fall,"" Yancy said.

Now, Dahlberg is urging parents to make sure their children are all properly vaccinated.

""I feel like I have failed my child because I could not protect him from everything that would cause harm,"" Dahlberg said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748658918.0,CDC Contradicts Kennedy and Keeps Advice That Children May Get Covid Shots,"Days after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid shots would be removed from the federal immunization schedule for children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated advice that largely countered Mr. Kennedy’s new policy.

The agency kept Covid shots on the schedule for healthy children 6 months to 17 years old, but added a new condition. Children and their caregivers will be able to get the vaccines in consultation with a doctor or provider, which the agency calls “shared decision-making.”

The shots will also remain available under those terms to about 38 million low-income children who rely on the Vaccines for Children program, according to an emailed update from the C.D.C. on Friday.
Mr. Kennedy’s original pronouncement on Tuesday had caused an uproar among pediatricians and public health experts, who pointed out that very young children and pregnant women face high risks of severe illness from the virus. Many also worried that the new policy would prompt insurers and government programs to reduce or drop coverage of the cost of the shots.

The latest changes clarify coverage for healthy children older than 6 months. But they leave those highest-risk groups — pregnant woman and young infants who are covered by immunization during pregnancy — without a formal recommendation.

The quick retreat this week from Mr. Kennedy’s vaccine proposals adds to a long list of Trump administration pledges that have been reversed days later. President Trump’s tariff policies, for example, have been revised repeatedly, and often weakened, after his tougher, initial actions.

Within the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Kennedy has also modified or selectively pulled back from his agenda. For example, after presiding over a reduction of 20,000 department employees that has shuttered many programs, he allowed for the return of some whose departures from important roles had drawn criticism from lawmakers and public health experts.

Mr. Kennedy’s efforts to revamp and, in some cases, dismantle standard vaccine protocols represent his long-held views as a vaccine skeptic. He has campaigned against Covid shots for children, and his decision this week to no longer recommend the vaccine for healthy children is aligned with vaccine skeptics who have opposed state mandates for vaccines and clamored for parents to decide which inoculations their children should receive.
In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, defended the shifts in policy this week.

“The old Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the C.D.C. vaccine schedule,” Mr. Nixon’s statement said. “The C.D.C. and H.H.S. encourage individuals to talk with their health care provider about any personal medical decision.

“Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, H.H.S. is restoring the doctor-patient relationship. If a parent desires their healthy child to be vaccinated, their decision should be based on informed consent through the clinical judgment of their health care provider.”

The policy changes on vaccines did not end uncertainty for pregnant women. [...] 

The C.D.C.’s determinations can be influential in setting insurance and public benefit coverage. It remains unclear how private health insurers and Medicaid will approach coverage of the Covid vaccine for pregnant women. A Covid shot costs about $130 out of pocket, which does not include a service fee to the facility or person administering the service. The total bill can exceed $200.

And the policy change on consultations with doctors or providers is likely to create barriers for children hoping to get a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, said Richard Hughes IV, a lawyer with Epstein Becker & Green who has advised vaccine companies. There is little privacy in pharmacies for consultations, and states differ in the scope of services pharmacists are permitted to perform.

“It is problematic,” he said. “It varies a lot by state and can create some issues for sure.”

The recommendation for “shared decision-making” with a health care provider is also likely to give some private insurers reason to withhold coverage, Mr. Hughes said. Insurers prefer clearer language — like they “must” or “shall” cover the vaccines — from the federal government’s experts, he added.

“The way it’s worked, in terms of coverage and access, has been a real challenge,” he said.
The changes continued Mr. Kennedy’s penchant for bypassing the accepted process for deciding vaccine policy.  Last week, the F.D.A. said that adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions could obtain new Covid vaccines in the fall. But the agency did not release a detailed outline of new information about risks and benefits of the product, as had accompanied past decisions.

Typically, the C.D.C. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices holds a public meeting where experts review data on vaccine safety and on rates of illness, hospitalization and death. The committee members then issue recommendations on who, depending on age groups or medical conditions, should get each vaccine. That committee, scheduled to meet later in June, h

(KPHO/Gray News) — An Arizona farm and one of the largest egg producers in the U.S. confirmed on Friday that it has lost nearly its entire chicken population in the state.

According to Hickman’s Family Farms, about six million birds have been lost due to bird flu.

“I’m here today to tell you that we’ve lost 95% of the chickens we have in the state,” Glenn Hickman, Hickman’s Family Farms’ president and CEO, said.

Hickman said hens at one of the farms began showing symptoms two weeks ago. Swabs were sent to the University of Arizona for analysis, and bird flu was detected.

“We shut down all traffic between farms and all personnel; everything we possibly could do to isolate that farm, and it didn’t work,” Hickman said. “We’ve been slowly losing the other three farms plus our replacement pullet flock over the past two weeks.”

According to Hickman, it’s the first time in 81 years that the company has been unable to fulfill 100% of customer demands.

The family farm said it is working to find alternative suppliers to keep Arizona stores and restaurants stocked.

But Hickman also announced that the situation has forced them to reduce staff at the farms.

The egg producer has approximately 850 employees, including contract workers and state inmates.

“They all have families and unfortunately, they’re going to be impacted by our inability to keep everybody employed as we rebuild our farm,” Hickman said.

It’s unclear how many employees will be affected. Hickman said it will take nearly two years to completely repopulate the farms.

“We need to access the vaccine that the federal government has already approved. We need to be able to start giving it to our flocks and the quicker that we can start vaccinating our nation’s poultry flock, the quicker that we can get back to normalized operations,” Hickman explained.

With measures in place to hopefully eliminate the virus, Hickman says the family’s next priority is prevention.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748640532.0,"US measles total nears 1,100 cases as Colorado reports airline cluster","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its weekly update today reported 42 measles cases, some tied to a large outbreak centered in West Texas and others linked to instances of community transmission or travel to other states or countries, lifting the nation's total to 1,088 infections.

Two more states reported their first cases this week, Iowa and Nebraska, putting the number of affected jurisdictions at 33. The number of outbreaks remained at 14, and 90% of cases are linked to outbreaks.

The overwhelming majority of patients (96%) are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and affected patients are roughly evenly split between kids younger than 5 years old, school-age children, and adults ages 20 and older.

In a related development, the CDC this week updated its measles travel advisory, noting that measles cases are rising in many countries and that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants ages 6 to 11 months old.

**West Texas total grows by 9**

The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 9 more cases in the West Texas outbreak, putting the total since January at 738. Though 35 counties have reported cases linked to the outbreak, only 7 still have ongoing transmission. 

Like other states, Texas also continues to record measles cases from various sources that apparently aren't linked to the larger outbreak, and today officials reported 8 more such infections, lifting that total to 32. 

A few other states have reported cases linked to West Texas activity, but no new illnesses were reported in New Mexico or Oklahoma. On May 28, Kansas reported a total of 64 cases from 11 counties, 59 of them linked to an outbreak in the southwestern part of the state.

Elsewhere, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said yesterday that it and partners in Arapahoe County have now confirmed three measles cases in people who were on the same Turkish Airlines flight that arrived in Denver on May 13. The latest patient is a vaccinated Arapahoe County adult, and the two earlier announced cases involved an out-of-state traveler who was infectious on the flight and an Arapahoe County child who was likely exposed on the flight. 

Measles is highly infectious and can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area.

Montana health officials reported a second measles case in Flathead County, a person who had traveled outside the state. Also, the health department in Gallatin County has now reported 2 community cases, beyond an earlier family cluster, putting the total at 10.

In Michigan, the Marquette County Health Department, located in the Upper Peninsula, reported a case in a local resident, noting that it was working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the case.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748606646.0,Norovirus vaccine produces mucosal immunity in phase 2b trial,"An oral tablet norovirus vaccine generated mucosal immunity and reduced viral shedding in participants in a new phase 2 placebo-controlled challenge study. The results were published recently in Science Translational Medicine.

Despite being the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide, there are currently no vaccines for norovirus (NV). In the past, phase 3 field trials have produced a lack of robust immunological correlates of protection, the authors of the study said, which is likely a problem of producing systemic, rather than targeted intestinal immunity, from the virus.

The oral tablet vaccine (VXA-G1.1-NN), built on a non-replicated adenovirus platform by Vaxart Inc, has proved to be safe and well-tolerated in previous trials. The tablet delivers NV capsid protein (VP1) to the small intestine. The current phase 2b trial included 165 individuals (18 to 49 years of age) who were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive VXA-G1.1-NN (86) or placebo (79). 

**30% relative reduction in norovirus**

In the challenge phase of the trial, participants received an oral challenge inoculum of NV 28 days after vaccination. Among VXA-G1.1-NN recipients, 57.1% developed NV infection, compared with 81.5% in the placebo group, with a 23.6% difference (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.4% to 38.0%). Overall, there was a 30% relative reduction in AGE in those who had been given the oral vaccine. 

Evidence of immunogenicity was observed in trial participants by day 28 post-vaccination. Also, stool and emesis samples showed significantly reduced viral RNA loads in the vaccinated group. 

""Vaccination reduced fecal viral shedding for up to 1 week postchallenge and inhibited asymptomatic shedding (25% shedding in placebo and 13% in VXA-G1.1-NN),"" the authors wrote. ""Given that fecal shedding can persist for up to 60 days after infection and that the magnitude and duration of shedding are comparable between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases (41), VXA-G1.1-NN may broadly reduce environmental viral spread.""",1kz2hjy,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/norovirus/norovirus-vaccine-produces-mucosal-immunity-phase-2b-trial?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKmfbVjbGNrAqZ9sWV4dG4DYWVtAjExAAEe7eAWTwfaXKes4Gn6Y3Jv4uF-Q4g2w-yYNycdo87Fa6Gb6rCrWkjsly8ODWY_aem_mRG7oBFVrE2AMCYcmQsEqg,202
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748556293.0,Man Died from Tick-Borne Virus. Now His Family Is Warning Others,"As the weather gets warmer, one Massachusetts family is sharing their heartbreaking story as a warning to others about a debilitating tick-borne disease. 

In April 2024, Kevin Boyce was unknowingly bitten by a tick. He started experiencing headaches, vomiting and other flu-like symptoms that rapidly progressed. Days later, the 62-year-old collapsed in his home and was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors diagnosed Kevin with **Powassan virus**, a rare and dangerous tick-borne disease.

Powassan virus is rare but the number of cases has significantly increased in the past decade. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures. Severe cases can lead to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (myelitis). About 10% of these advanced cases are fatal, according to Yale Medicine.

Erin explained that despite Kevin being treated in the ICU, he ultimately suffered severe brain damage from the disease.

""His brain had blown up so much, from the encephalitis, and he had really bad brain damage,"" she told CBS News. ""It was horrifying, but we knew what Kevin would want, so you know, we just had to let him go.""

Kevin died a few weeks after arriving at the hospital, leaving behind a wife, two sons and a granddaughter. Erin said that she and her family are now hoping that sharing Kevin’s story will encourage others to be cautious.

""We just want the public to know what to look for and be wary of ticks, especially if you have one on your body,"" she said.

**In 2024, 54 cases of Powassan virus disease were reported in the United States, with 12 cases reported in Massachusetts.** According to the CDC, there are no vaccines to prevent POWV or medicines to treat it. However, a number of precautionary measures can be taken to avoid ticks.

To prevent exposure to ticks, according to the National Institutes of Health, wear clothing that covers your arms and legs and tuck your pants into your socks or put tape around openings in clothing. Wear light-colored clothing so you can see if a tick is on you. When you are in the woods, keep to the center of the trail, since ticks tend to like shrubs and bushes. Use a chemical repellent with DEET, permethrin or picaridin.

After coming indoors, check yourself, children and pets for ticks. If you do find one, use tweezers to remove it as soon as possible.

It takes a week to one month after the bite from an infected tick to develop symptoms of POWV disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches, according to the Massachusetts Department of Health. Shower as soon as you can and wash your clothes in high heat to kill any remaining ticks.

contagioncuriosity,fireflychild024,1748550111.0,RFK Jr threatens ban on federal scientists publishing in top journals,"
We need to save every piece of evidence collected here before it’s destroyed by the current administration. Journals are credible sources that save lives. The government is trying to erase scientific knowledge and living history to cover their tracks as they cut vaccine access.
———————————————————
*From the article:*
“Robert F Kennedy Jr has threatened to ban government scientists from publishing in the world’s leading medical journals, which he branded “corrupt”, and to instead create alternative publications run by the state.

“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Jama and those other journals, because they’re all corrupt,” the US health secretary said on the Ultimate Human podcast. He accused the publications of being controlled by pharmaceutical companies.

Instead, Kennedy outlined plans to launch government-run journals that would become “the preeminent journals” because National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding would anoint researchers “as a good, legitimate scientist”.

The three publications Kennedy targeted are among the most influential medical journals globally, established in the 19th century and now central to disseminating peer-reviewed medical research worldwide. The Lancet and Jama each report more than 30m annual website visits, while the New England Journal of Medicine claims more than 1 million weekly readers.

Kennedy has similarly accused the agencies he now oversees – including the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – as “sock puppets” for the pharmaceutical industry.

The second Trump administration has taken an axe to scientific research, with NIH funding cut by more than $3bn since the year before. Kennedy has also purged an estimated 20,000 health department staff from the government.

Adam Gaffney, a public health researcher at Harvard Medical School, told the Washington Post: “Banning NIH-funded researchers from publishing in leading medical journals and requiring them to publish only in journals that carry the RFK Jr seal of approval would delegitimize taxpayer-funded research.”

The health secretary’s comments followed the release of a White House report last week that challenged medical consensus on vaccines and suggested pharmaceutical influence has prevented proper study of chronic disease causes in children.

Kennedy justified his position by citing decade-old concerns from journal editors themselves about pharmaceutical influence, including former New England Journal of Medicine chief Marcia Angell’s 2009 warning that “it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published” due to financial ties with pharmaceutical companies.

The funding cuts and personnel changes have prompted some US scientists to consider relocating abroad, with countries including France, Germany, Spain and China actively recruiting American researchers.”",1kyl47b,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/28/rfk-jr-medical-journals,139
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748556695.0,"Southern Alberta's 472 confirmed measles cases 'tip of the iceberg,' health official says","As southern Alberta battles its worst measles outbreak in decades, some doctors are warning the virus is more rampant than the case counts show and they're now struggling to keep up with demand.

As of midday Wednesday,  628 cases had been confirmed in Alberta since the outbreaks began in March.

The last time the province reported more cases was 1987, when 690 cases were confirmed.

""Unfortunately I think, for at least parts of the province, this is no longer controllable,"" said Craig Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Calgary.

The vast majority of this year's cases — 472 cases as of Wednesday — are in the south zone. 

And the Taber Health Centre emergency department is dealing with high volumes of measles patients, according Dr. Eric Leishman, a family physician working there.

""Almost every single patient that I have swabbed in the ER for suspected measles has tested positive,"" he said in an email.

""For many of the measles patients we see in the ER, we are often told that they have multiple family members who have also had measles recently. So the number of reported official cases is only a fraction of actual cases that are out there.""

A standing measles exposure advisory is now in effect for the entire zone due to widespread risk in southern Alberta. 

""Obviously, we are quite concerned … about those numbers, the number of hospitalizations, and how many more weeks [and] months we may be in this,"" said Dr. Vivien Suttorp, the lead medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services in the south zone

""It's all hands on deck.""

According to Suttorp, teams from across the health system are working together to rein in the outbreaks.

Negative pressure rooms can be used in equipped hospitals to prevent the spread of the airborne virus. 

Plans have also been made for stand-alone assessment and treatment centres, and those will be opened based on need.

As well, teams are also testing and treating people in their homes to prevent onward transmission, she said.

Confirmed case counts represent the ""tip of the iceberg,"" according to Suttorp, and they're increasing rapidly.

""Not everybody seeks medical care. Not everybody needs additional medical assessment,"" she said.

""So we know that the numbers are larger than what we are seeing. The other piece is that it is spreading across southern Alberta in quite a short time period.""

She noted broader community transmission — where sporadic cases with no known source are identified — has been increasing over the last 10 days. [...] 

The Alberta government website states that between one and three of every 1,000 people infected will die.

""It is extremely frustrating that our ER patient volumes are becoming nearly unmanageable due to an infectious disease that is preventable with routine immunization,"" said Leishman.

Provincial data shows the vast majority of cases are among the unimmunized.

""Many of our physicians are experiencing burnout and having difficulty with the increased volume of ER patients,"" he said.

Another physician shared similar concerns about patient volumes, noting Taber is a small community with limited health-care workers, and nurses are also being asked to work more shifts.

The province has identified the Municipal District of Taber, the County of Lethbridge and the County of Forty Mile as key hotspots in southern Alberta.

**According to provincial data, 55.8 per cent of two-year-olds in the south zone were fully vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine in 2024.**

**The M.D. of Taber had the lowest rate at 28.7 per cent.**

That's far below the 95 per cent overall vaccination rate infectious disease experts say is needed for population level protection.

Leishman calls the immunization rates in his community, ""shockingly low.""

Provincial data shows a total of 44 Albertans had been hospitalized due to measles as of May 17. No deaths have been reported.

""We have seen some bad outcomes, particularly in younger children and infants,"" said Leishman.

""We have had several children who have required hospital admission, and even intubation due to respiratory distress.""

Some of the sickest children, from both the south and central zones, have been sent to Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary for treatment in recent weeks.

""There are many, many, many people across the province — but also in southern Alberta — that are at risk of being exposed and getting disease,"" said Suttorp.

""It is important that families are aware of the serious complications and to seek medical attention early rather than late."" [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748462121.0,Doctors fear ‘devastating consequences’ for pregnant people after RFK Jr order on Covid-19 boosters,"Advocates for pregnant people said they are alarmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr’s unprecedented and unilateral decision to remove Covid-19 booster shots from the recommended immunization schedule.

A vaccine’s inclusion on the schedule is important for patient access, because many private health insurance plans determine which vaccines to cover based on the schedule.

“Covid-19’s impact on pregnancy is deeply personal to me,” said Dr Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer at March of Dimes, a non-profit focused on the health of mothers and babies, in a statement.

“During the height of the pandemic, I cared for a healthy patient who was 32 weeks pregnant and tragically died from Covid-19 despite state-of-the-art medical care. One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”

The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.

In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.

“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.

Kennedy made the announcement on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.

Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices.

Kennedy’s announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources told STAT. The CDC is currently without a leader.

A directive making the change official, also reported by STAT, suggested that Kennedy reviewed the evidence with the FDA. That agency’s advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC’s, was also bypassed.

Just a week earlier, the FDA’s head, Dr Marty Makary, published a similarly unprecedented article in the New England Journal of Medicine that described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe Covid-19”.

As of Tuesday, the CDC’s website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.

Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.

“Kennedy’s unilateral decision to change the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.

“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.’ Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”

Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated. CDC data shows only about 14% of pregnant people received the most recently updated Covid-19 vaccine.

Kennedy’s decision to unilaterally change the vaccine recommendation comes as some of his supporters, particularly anti-vaccine advocates, continue to call for Covid-19 vaccines to be completely removed from the market.",1kxqrx5,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/pregnant-people-rfk-jr-covid-vaccines,839
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748476167.0,US cancels more than $700 million funding for Moderna bird flu vaccine,"May 28 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has canceled a contract awarded to Moderna (MRNA.O), opens new tab for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans, as well as the right to purchase shots, the drugmaker announced on Wednesday.

Shares of Moderna were flat in after-market trading.

Moderna in January was awarded $590 million by the Biden administration to advance the development of its bird flu vaccine, and support the expansion of clinical studies for up to five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza. 

This was in addition to $176 million awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year to complete the late-stage development and testing of a pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccine against the H5N1 avian influenza.

HHS told Reuters earlier this year that it was reviewing agreements made by the Biden administration for vaccine production.

""The cancellation means that the government is discarding what could be one of the most effective and rapid tools to combat an avian influenza outbreak,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, adding that it is the opposite approach Trump took with Operation Warp Speed to combat COVID-19. 

An HHS spokesperson said that after a comprehensive internal review, the agency had determined that the project did not meet the scientific standards or safety expectations required for continued federal investment.

Bird flu has infected 70 people, most of them farm workers, over the past year as it has spread aggressively among cattle herds and poultry flocks.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned the use of vaccines and earlier this year drew censure from some in the U.S. Congress after he suggested in a television interview that poultry farmers should let the bird flu spread unchecked through their flocks to study chickens who did not contract it.

Moderna said it plans to explore alternatives for late-stage development and manufacturing of the vaccine.

The company has been banking on revenue from newer mRNA shots, including its bird flu vaccine and experimental COVID-flu combination vaccine, to make up for waning post-pandemic demand for its COVID vaccine.

Moderna also said on Wednesday that it had received positive interim data from a mid-stage trial set up to test the safety and immunogenicity of its bird flu vaccine targeting the H5 avian influenza virus subtype.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748468329.0,"Amid measles outbreak, Texas is poised to make vaccine exemptions for kids easier","AUSTIN, Texas — Texas this year has been the center of the nation’s largest measles outbreak in more than two decades, as a mostly eradicated disease has sickened more than 700 in the state, sent dozens to hospitals and led to the death of two children who were unvaccinated.

But even as the outbreak slows, a bill approved by state lawmakers and sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would make it significantly easier for parents to enroll their children in school without standard vaccinations for diseases such as measles, whooping cough, polio and hepatitis A and B.

Supporters say the bill streamlines an already legal exemption process that allows families to avoid vaccines for reasons of conscience, religious beliefs or medical reasons. It would let them download the required forms from a website instead of contacting state health officials and waiting for one to come in the mail.

The bill does not change which vaccines are required. However, critics say easing the exemption process opens a door to further outbreaks with potentially deadly results.

“If this bill becomes law, Texas is likely to see more illness, more death and higher health care costs for families and business,” Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for Texas-based nonprofit Immunization Project, told state senators before the bill won final approval.

The outbreak (in Texas) is not a coincidence. It is the canary in the coal mine screaming at the top of its lungs,” she said.

The exemption bill — as well as other bills passed by the Texas House on lawsuits against vaccine makers and removing immunization restrictions on organ transplants — are a snapshot of efforts across dozens of conservative states to question vaccines or roll back requirements.

At the national level, this wave has been buoyed by still-lingering pushback from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump administration’s embrace of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was one of the nation’s leading anti-vaccine advocates before being appointed secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.

The most recent federal data shows U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates have dipped since the pandemic — 92.7% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 95% before COVID-19 — and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high. And last week, the “Make America Healthy Again” federal report on the nation’s health and wellness questioned the necessity of vaccine mandates for schoolkids.

The national Association of Immunization Managers, an organization of state and local immunization officials, has been tracking nearly 600 vaccine-related bills across the country in 2025, and the majority would not be considered pro-vaccine, said Brent Ewig, the group’s the group’s chief policy officer.

“We saw a spike in vaccine-related bills during the pandemic. The last few years it had been tapering off. With recent actions at the federal level, there has been a spike again,” Ewig said.

[...]

The bill on vaccine exemption paperwork would make it easier for parents to obtain the needed form by letting them download it to a computer or smartphone. The current system where parents ask state health officials to mail a paper copy to their home can sometimes take weeks. The form would still need to be notarized before it is turned in to a school and a student is enrolled.

Advocates say the changes would help parents thread the bureaucratic process and get their children enrolled in school quicker.

“This bill is not about whether vaccines are good or bad, it’s about government efficiency and keeping kids in schools,” said Jackie Schlegal, founder of Texans for Medical Freedom, which advocates for “vaccine freedom of choice.”

Critics argue that simplifying the exemption form process makes it too easy for unvaccinated kids to enroll in a school, endangering the health of other kids and families.

“For years Texas has struck a delicate balance of parents’ right and public health and safety,” Lakshmanan said. “This bill is more than just a form. … We can support parents without putting other families at risk.”

Still waiting for a Senate vote is a bill that would allow vaccine makers who advertise in Texas to be sued if their vaccine causes a person to be injured. That bill has been opposed by the Texas Association of Manufacturers.

The author of that bill is first-term state Rep. Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed in 2020 for opening her Dallas salon in violation of governor’s emergency order during the pandemic. Abbott quickly weakened his enforcement of coronavirus safeguards and a court ordered her released.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (May 28) received a report of a severe paediatric case of COVID-19 infection. Although the rate of increase in the COVID-19 activity level in Hong Kong has begun to slow down, the CHP expected the COVID-19 activity level to remain at a relatively high level in a short period of time. Therefore, high-risk individuals are reminded to receive a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible and receive booster doses at appropriate times to minimise the risk of serious complications and death after infection.

The case involves a 1-year-old girl who has good past health. She has developed fever and runny nose since yesterday (May 27) and was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital today for treatment after having convulsion. She was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. Her respiratory specimen tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 infection complicated with encephalitis. She remains hospitalised and is in critical condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the patient had not received COVID-19 vaccine and had no travel history during the incubation period. Three of her household contacts were symptomatic. Two of them tested positive for COVID-19 by rapid antigen tests and had recovered.

The CHP believes that COVID-19 has become an endemic disease with cyclical patterns. The overall activity of COVID-19 in the local community has continued to rise since mid-March of this year. According to the latest surveillance data as of the week ending May 17, the increase in the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from sewage surveillance and the test positivity rate of respiratory samples have slowed down compared to the past week. **Genetic analysis showed that XDV and its descendent lineages have become the dominating variant strains in Hong Kong. As XDV is a JN.1-related variant, the COVID-19 vaccines currently used in Hong Kong are still effective in preventing it. Latest information does not suggest XDV will cause a more severe disease than JN.1.**

The CHP reminded the public who have not received the initial dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (including infants and children) that they should get vaccinated as soon as possible. Those at high risk (particularly the elderly and persons with underlying comorbidities) should receive a booster dose as soon as possible for effective prevention against COVID-19 to minimise the risk of serious complications and death after infection.

Apart from vaccination, in order to prevent COVID-19, influenza, and other respiratory illnesses as well as transmission in the community, the public should maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene at all times and note the following:

Also, other states added new cases to their totals, including North Dakota, Kansas, and Virginia.

**Source unclear in Iowa, Nebraska cases**

The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said its recently confirmed case is the first since 2019. The patient is an unvaccinated adult from central Iowa.

Officials said a thorough investigation has been completed, but they did not say how the patient likely contracted the virus. The health department said it would reach out to the contacts it identified, but it added that widespread exposure isn’t anticipated.

Robert Kruse, MD, MPH, the state’s medical director, said, “We ask Iowans to review their vaccination records and medical records to ensure they are protected and to reach out to their healthcare provider if they have questions.”

Meanwhile, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services today reported a confirmed measles case involving an appropriately vaccinated child from Sheridan County who had no history of out-of-state travel. Sheridan County is in northwestern Nebraska.

Health officials reported possible exposures at two locations, a discount store in Rushville and a medical clinic in Gordon.

**Texas and New Mexico see slight rises**

In the large West Texas outbreaks, Texas and New Mexico each reported one new case today.

The Texas Department of State Health Services said the additional case brings the state’s outbreak total to 729 since late January. Though outbreak-linked cases have been reported from 34 counties, only 7 of them have ongoing transmission. Of the 729 cases, 692 involved people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.

Cases in the outbreak have been trending downward since the end of March. Texas has also reported 24 other measles cases that don’t have clear links to the West Texas outbreak.

The New Mexico Department of Health also reported one new case, lifting its total to 79. The newest case is from Sandoval County in the west central part of the state, which just reported four new cases on May 23. One was an infant too young to be vaccinated, and the others were adults with at least one vaccine dose.

**More cases in North Dakota, Kansas, and Virginia**

Elsewhere, North Dakota Health and Human Services reported the first two cases from Grand Forks County, the third to be affected by measles, bringing the state’s total to 21. All were unvaccinated. The patients are thought to have contracted the virus during international travel.

Health officials said the most recent cases from the other two counties—Cass and Williams—were contacts of the state’s earlier cases.

Kansas health officials reported a measles case from Pawnee County, and in a joint statement, state and county authorities said it’s not clear if the case is linked to an ongoing outbreak in Southwest Kansas. Pawnee County is in the west central part of the state.

The experts said NB.1.8.1 is fueling rises in cases and hospitalization in some countries in the WHO Western Pacific region, but there are no reports that illnesses are more severe than those from other circulating variants.

NB.1.8.1 clusters with other JN.1 sublineages and descends from XDV.1.5.1. The earliest sample was collected on January 22. So far sequences have been submitted from 22 countries, and, based on limited sequencing data, officials estimate that the virus made up 10.7% of sequences by the end of April, up significantly from 2.5% in the four previous weeks. The prevalence rose in all three WHO regions that regularly report sequences: Western Pacific, Americas, and European.

**Low risk based on limited evidence**

TAG-VE said the risk is currently low and that the confidence in the assessment is low, given that only a single study has assessed antigenicity using pseudoviruses with serologic data from two cohorts. It added that more studies are needed to further assess the risk of antibody escape. So far, the evidence doesn't suggest resistance to the antiviral drug nirmaltelvir, which is one of the two components of Paxlovid treatment.

On May 15, the WHO's COVID vaccine composition advisory group said JN.1 and KP.2 remain appropriate vaccine antigens, but monovalent LP.8.1—which seems to show more robust neutralization against newer subvariants—is a suitable alternative. The European Medicines Agency preferentially recommended an LP.8.1 component, and the US Food and Drug Administration also said vaccines should target JN.1, preferentially the LP.8.1 component.",1kwvrm1,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/who-adds-nb181-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKi6_pjbGNrAqLr92V4dG4DYWVtAjExAAEev2V2ZsR5D_UJ7O_hYoXTc6hAqrbhcZSJjoJvI4cJXTfZnXKcFlgTdFaPe1I_aem_nhCXNys6G7enGjnyNigVRw,44
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748345642.0,Malawi battles mpox as cases of the infectious disease surge in Africa,"Malawi’s ministry of health has announced three new cases of mpox in the capital, Lilongwe, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 11 since the country’s first was reported in April.

Malawi is one of 16 countries in Africa reporting mpox outbreaks as health officials battle with vaccine shortages as well as limited testing and hospital capacity.

The Public Health Institute of Malawi said the patients were aged between 17 and 41. “Investigations are under way to establish the possible source of infection and trace contacts,” the department said in a statement last week.

The first cases in Malawi come after US government aid cuts to healthcare, including HIV programmes, badly hit the country and raised fears of an escalation of infectious diseases. HIV medication programmes have been severely depleted by the cuts.

“A commonality about these cases is that some were immunocompromised,” said Richard Mvula, spokesperson for the Lilongwe district health office. Health officials had reported that patients who had been on ART (antiretroviral therapy) had been forced to stop taking their medication because of the drug shortages.

HIV can worsen the risk and severity of mpox, while effective HIV treatment can help manage the risk. People living with HIV, especially those with uncontrolled viral loads, may experience a more severe form of mpox.

Malawi had been on alert since the global mpox outbreak began in 2022 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and several other African countries.

The news of the first cases last month prompted fears of an outbreak. While most cases have been restricted to Lilongwe, a two-year-old was found with the condition in Mangochi district, about 150 miles (240km) from the capital.

While recorded cases remain low in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world, mpox has surged in the region overall. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) reports 52,082 cases since the beginning of 2025, with more than 1,770 deaths during the outbreak as a whole.

In a briefing to journalists last week, Africa CDC officials said they were seeing different patterns of transmission between countries. In Sierra Leone, where cases are rising “exponentially”, the clade IIb form of the virus is circulating. In the DRC and its neighbours it is clade Ia and Ib that dominate.

They said the continent would need about 6.4m doses of vaccine, but was still far from having that available, with only 1.3m received so far. They also highlighted a lack of testing capacity in many countries, and warned that in Sierra Leone patients were being treated two to a bed.

Malawi’s health system faces many challenges, including long distances to clinics, insufficient funding, a shortage of equipment and a lack of qualified personnel. In March this year, the Joint UN Programme on HIV and Aids drew attention to the immediate risks of the US funding cuts on HIV programmes in Malawi. [...] 


Knowledge of mpox around the country is low, reminiscent of the Covid-19 outbreak where myths were rife and people resorted to tree leaves and herbs to cure the symptoms. Thousands of people died.

A series of interviews across the capital showed most people have no knowledge of mpox. In central Lilongwe, taxi driver Steven Banda outlined what he knew.

“I came across an official from the ministry of health who was explaining about it and advised that we should be careful since it is dangerous. She described the symptoms including swellings, and mentioned some of the districts affected. I’m not aware of any cases in my area or seen anyone suffering from the disease. We don’t know much about it,” he said. [...] 

Mithi said that with the lessons drawn from Covid-19 and other infectious diseases, Malawi had the capacity to manage mpox, at clinical and community level.

“The challenge exists though because of the withdrawal of the US aid; the capacity of our healthcare system is no longer the same. Almost 60% of our healthcare system is donor dependent, of which more than 50% of the donor aid was coming from [the US]. So the withdrawal means that our healthcare system is completely shaken, we are left in a state where we didn’t build internal capacities to sustain ourselves,” Mithi added.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748143114.0,Why are more than 300 people in the US still dying from COVID every week?,"More than five years after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the United States, hundreds of people are still dying every week.

Last month, an average of about 350 people died each week from COVID, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While high, the number of deaths is decreasing and is lower than the peak of 25,974 deaths recorded the week ending Jan. 9, 2021, as well as weekly deaths seen in previous spring months, CDC data shows.

Public health experts told ABC News that although the U.S. is in a much better place than it was a few years ago, COVID is still a threat to high-risk groups.

""The fact that we're still seeing deaths just means it's still circulating, and people are still catching it,"" Dr. Tony Moody, a professor in the department of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Duke University Medical Center, told ABC News.

The experts said there are a few reasons why people might still be dying from the virus, including low vaccination uptake, waning immunity and not enough people accessing treatments.

During the 2024-25 season, only 23% of adults aged 18 and older received the updated COVID-19 vaccine as of the week ending April 26, according to CDC data.

Among children, just 13% of them received the updated COVID vaccine over the same period, the data shows.

Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute -- which focuses on disease prevention -- said there are likely not enough people receiving the vaccine, which is contributing to the number of weekly COVID deaths.

However, for those who have received the vaccine, some may not be developing a proper immune response.

""There are some people who may be genetically inclined to not respond well to the vaccine. That's the topic I have studied with other viral vaccines,"" Poland told ABC News. ""The more common issue is that people are immunocompromised and can't respond well.""

Additionally, Poland said that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines wanes over time, increasing the likelihood of being infected.

This is why the current recommendation for those aged 65 and older is to receive two doses of the updated COVID vaccine six months apart.

""Another reason for death due to COVID is being elderly, being what we call immunosenescent, where you do not have the immunologic ability to respond the same way you did in your 30s and 40s,"" Poland said. ""On top of it, if you do get infected by the time you're in your 70s, 80s, there is some … accumulating co-morbidity.""

CDC data shows that those aged 75 and older currently have the highest rate of COVID-19 deaths at 4.66 per 100,000.

Currently, there are treatments for COVID-19 patients in the form of antiviral pills, including molnupiravir from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Paxlovid from Pfizer.

Both treatments must be started within five days of COVID symptoms appearing and are given twice daily for five days, with Merck's being four pills each time and Pfizer's being three pills each.

There is also remdesivir, an intravenous medication that must be started within seven days of COVID symptoms appearing.

""I do think that we don't necessarily make use of the tools that we have on hand in the best way possible,"" Moody said. ""I've certainly talked to people who have gotten medications when they got COVID and they made a huge difference. … The trials' data would definitely suggest that the drugs are effective.""

""I do think that we may not be using the drugs as effectively, or in as many people as it might help,"" he continued.

Moody said it's possible some COVID patients are coming down with symptoms but are not going to the doctor until their symptoms become severe. Alternatively, some people are not undergoing COVID testing when they have symptoms and, therefore, are missing COVID diagnoses.

""I'm sure that there are people who are infected who are not being detected [and not being] treated,"" Moody said, but he added that not everyone needs to be tested regularly and that just high-risk people should test more frequently.",1kusx5p,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/300-people-us-dying-covid-week/story?id=122068959,758
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748132708.0,"As Texas’s measles outbreak slows, officials warn of rise in other states","The measles outbreak in Texas is showing signs of slowing, though other states are seeing more cases and health officials are warning against complacency as the US continues to experience high rates of measles amid falling vaccination rates.

It has been a handful of days since anyone in Lubbock, Texas, has tested positive, and there are no known measles hospitalizations at the children’s hospital in the city, which has also cared for children from nearby Gaines county.

“We’re really cautiously optimistic,” said Katherine Wells, the director of Lubbock Public Health.

It takes 42 days with no new measles cases to declare a community’s outbreak is over, so Lubbock is not out of the woods yet, she said.

Wastewater analyses indicate infections may be going down in El Paso and Lubbock, said Anthony Maresso, a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine who is part of a team monitoring wastewater pathogens in 15 cities across Texas.

But this doesn’t mean the danger has passed. Wells and Maresso warned against letting up on momentum against the deadly disease outbreak.

“We’re still seeing measles cases in El Paso. We’re seeing measles cases in some of the other states in the central United States. It really just takes one person in a car who’s infectious to introduce it into another community,” Wells said.

Texas announced six new cases on Friday for a total of 728 this year. A total of 94 people have been hospitalized in the Texas outbreak and two school-aged children died.

The west Texas outbreak has also spread to a handful of other states. Officials in New Mexico announced on Thursday the tally had risen to 76 cases, and they confirmed that the death of an adult in March was indeed caused by measles.

There have been 58 cases in Kansas and 17 cases in Oklahoma, in addition to other states seeing separate outbreaks.

The US now has a total of 1,024 confirmed measles cases, which makes 2025 the second-worst year already for measles since the virus was declared eliminated from the US in 2000.

The outbreak may be losing steam in west Texas because of successful vaccination campaigns and because many people who were not vaccinated have now been infected.

[...] 

Communities that have fallen below the 95% threshold for community immunity (also known as herd immunity) should run vaccination campaigns now, before new outbreaks begin, both Wells and Maresso said.

“The easiest thing you can do, in this case, is just put out an educational campaign around closing the vaccine gap,” said Maresso. “If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks. It’s that effective.”

Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”

Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.

“We see lots of movement in the summer,” Wells continued. “So you see lots of people traveling internationally to places that might have endemic measles, that can reintroduce it into any vulnerable community across the United States.”

Monitoring wastewater can serve as an early warning sign of a budding outbreak, especially in places with low vaccination rates.

The Texas wastewater monitoring was funded by the state legislature through the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute (TEPHI), created during the Covid pandemic “as kind of a Texas version of the CDC”, Maresso said.

“We saw a signal for measles in the wastewater before any of this outbreak discussion in Texas or really before it started to become a headline worldwide,” Maresso said.

“If we are seeing the earliest stages of an outbreak, it gives us a lead time to warn public health folks: ‘There are cases. You’re probably not seeing them on the clinical radar, but there are cases in your community, and you should expect that you’re going to start to see cases – and if they’re not vaccinated, it’s going to get worse.’”

Local leaders should prepare for measles outbreaks now, Wells said. [...] 

But all of that work requires funding. While public health departments have frequently worked on shoestring budgets, the Trump administration has made funding even more precarious.

“There was a clawback of the Covid funding that was available to local health departments,” Wells said. And with other federal funds for public health, “it’s even harder to follow exactly what’s going on,” Wells noted.

“I’m concerned. It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”",1kupv7h,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/24/texas-measles-outbreak,50
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748130870.0,"56 Years After First Case, Lassa Fever Turns Endemic In Nigeria","Lassa fever has persisted as a public health burden in Nigeria, claiming lives, especially in rural and under-resourced communities.

First identified in 1969 in the town of Lassa in Borno State, the disease has since entrenched itself in the country’s epidemiological landscape, with seasonal outbreaks occurring between November and April.

Despite interventions, the fight against Lassa fever in the country remains far from over. [...] 

So far in 2025, 18 states have recorded at least one confirmed case of Lassa fever, spanning 93 local government areas.

The Lassa fever situation report for Week 18 (Epidemiological Week 18) released recently by the NCDC, revealed that three states – Ondo, Bauchi, and Taraba – account for 71 per cent of all confirmed cases. Ondo alone reported 30 per cent, Bauchi 25 per cent, and Taraba 16 per cent. The remaining 28 per cent were spread across 15 other states. [...] 

While Nigeria continues to battle recurrent outbreaks, experts and stakeholders have called for more sustainable interventions. Advanced research, increased government commitment and stronger international collaborations are needed to improve prevention and control strategies, they said.

An Associate Professor of Infectious Disease and Genomics at the Department of Microbiology, Adeleke University, Dr Kolawole Oladipo, emphasised the need for sustained investment in diagnostics, community engagement, and health system strengthening to effectively tackle Lassa fever in the country. He noted that local research leadership must be central to this effort.

According to Dr Kolawole, integrating technology with traditional knowledge and enforcing relevant health policies could help Nigeria shift from repeated outbreaks to long-term control and eventual elimination of the disease.

He told LEADERSHIP Weekend that the country must adopt a multi-sectoral, science-driven and community-centered approach to address prevention, detection, treatment and health system resilience.

“We should leverage local health and biomedical influencers, radio drama and social media platforms like TikTok and WhatsApp to deliver culturally appropriate messages. Training community volunteers such as village health workers to educate people about the dangers of bush burning, unsafe food storage and harmful burial practices is also critical,” he said.

Dr Kolawole further urged increased support for local vaccine development, highlighting the work of institutions like the Helix Biogen Institute and ACEGID, among others, leading efforts in this field.

Addressing environmental factors that increase vulnerability to the virus, a public health expert, Dr Ozy Okonokhua explained that “rodents, the primary carriers of Lassa fever, thrive in dirty and unhygienic environments. Maintaining clean surroundings and properly covering food are essential steps to breaking the chain of transmission.”

Dr Okonokhua also raised concerns about the urban bias in current awareness campaigns, noting that rural communities where Lassa fever often hits hardest are frequently left out.

“Many rural residents dry their grains in the open, leaving them exposed to rodent contamination. Without practical alternatives for food preservation, awareness alone will not suffice,” he said.

He called for the active involvement of traditional rulers and religious leaders in spreading health information in local languages to ensure better reach and understanding across communities.

With the dual threat of environmental exposure and human-to-human transmission, controlling Lassa fever requires a community-wide commitment to sanitation, awareness and early medical intervention.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there are 1,046 confirmed measles cases, up 22 from last week. Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed only 10 more cases this past week for a total of 728.

There are three other major outbreaks in North America. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,795 cases from mid-October through May 20, an increase of 173 cases in a week. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 538 as of Thursday.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748026931.0,"'A national scandal': US excess deaths rose even after pandemic, far outpacing peer countries","Excess deaths in the United States kept rising even after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 1.5 million in 2022 and 2023 that would have been prevented had US death rates matched those of peer countries, estimates a Boston University (BU)-led study today in JAMA Health Forum.

The data show a continuation of a decades-old trend toward increasing US excess deaths, mainly among working-age adults, largely driven by drug overdoses, gun violence, auto accidents, and preventable cardiometabolic causes, the researchers say.

""The US has been in a protracted health crisis for decades, with health outcomes far worse than other high-income countries,"" says lead and corresponding author Jacob Bor, ScD, said in a BU news release. ""This longer-run tragedy continued to unfold in the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic.""

**US death rates waned slower starting in 1980**

The investigators analyzed all-cause death data in the United States and 21 other high-income countries (HICs) in the Human Mortality Database from January 1980 to December 2023. They calculated annual age-specific death rates for the United States and the population-weighted average of other HICs. 

Mortality rates decreased more slowly in the US than in other high-income countries (HICs) between 1980 and 2019, resulting in growing numbers of excess US deaths compared with other HICs.

The team counted the number of US deaths that would have been expected each year had the country experienced the age-specific death rates of other HICs, computed ratios of observed-to-expected US deaths, and estimated the number of excess deaths attributable to the US mortality disadvantage. They fit a linear regression model to determine whether the number of excess US deaths in 2023 differed from the 2014 to 2019 prepandemic trend.

""Mortality rates decreased more slowly in the US than in other high-income countries (HICs) between 1980 and 2019, resulting in growing numbers of excess US deaths compared with other HICs,"" the study authors noted. 

**Rates more than double comparable nations in young adults**

From 1980 to 2023, 107.5 million people died in the United States, and 230.2 million people did so in other HICs. During this period, an estimated 14.7 million excess US deaths occurred, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. 

Yet there were still more than 1.5 million excess deaths in 2022 and 2023, and rates remained substantially elevated compared with those from before the pandemic. Other HICs saw less-pronounced pandemic surges.

Gaps between the United States and other HICs widened before and during the pandemic, especially among younger adults, before shrinking in 2022 and 2023. Age-standardized death rate ratios comparing the United States with other HIC averages were 1.20 in 2010 (20% higher), 1.28 in 2019, 1.46 in 2021, and 1.30 in 2023. Death rates among US adults aged 25 to 44 years were 2.6 times higher than in other HICs in 2023.

**Deep cuts to public health likely to widen disparity**

Excess deaths attributable to the US mortality disadvantage peaked in 2020 and 2021, at 1 million in 2020 and 1.1 million in 2021, before declining to 820,396 in 2022 and 705,331 in 2023. These numbers followed four decades of increasing excess deaths, reaching 631,247 in 2019. In 2023, excess US deaths made up 22.9% of all deaths and 46.0% of those among people younger than 65 years.

""The 700,000 excess American deaths in 2023 is exactly what you'd predict based on prior rising trends, even if there had never been a pandemic,"" coauthor Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, PhD, of the University of Minnesota, said in the release. ""These deaths are driven by long-running crises in drug overdose, gun violence, car collisions, and preventable cardiometabolic deaths.""

Senior author Andrew Stokes, PhD, of BU, said that other countries demonstrate that investing in universal healthcare, strong safety nets, and evidence-based public health policies leads to longer, healthier lives. ""Unfortunately, the US faces unique challenges; public distrust of government and growing political polarization have made it harder to implement policies that have proven successful elsewhere,"" he said.

Bor said, ""Imagine the lives saved, the grief and trauma averted, if the US simply performed at the average of our peers. One out of every two US deaths under 65 years is likely avoidable. Our failure to address this is a national scandal.""

""Deep cuts to public health, scientific research, safety net programs, environmental regulations, and federal health data could lead to a further widening of health disparities between the US and other wealthy nations, and growing numbers of excess—and utterly preventable—deaths to Americans,"" he added",1ktrorv,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/national-scandal-us-excess-deaths-rose-even-after-pandemic-far-outpacing-peer-countries,396
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748035731.0,RFK Jr.’s report had a surprise target: Your doctor,"From food to pharma, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took on all the suspects he’s long maligned in a report on health threats to kids — along with one unexpected one: Doctors.

Laced throughout the report from Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again Commission are accusations against doctors — for reportedly being influenced by the pharmaceutical industry to overprescribe certain medications and for failing to treat the root causes of disease. The report, released Thursday, calls out the American Medical Association, the country’s leading physicians’ group, by name for adopting a policy the report claims discourages providers from deviating from standard practices and scientists from studying adverse vaccine reactions.

The surprise focus on physicians — softened in the report by calling them “well-intended” — comes after weeks of furious lobbying by the food, pharmaceutical and farming industries who feared being demonized by the review.

Instead, the report adopts an argument popularized by Kennedy and many of his colleagues in President Donald Trump’s health department during the Covid pandemic, that the medical profession is dominated by groupthink and has been swayed by corporate interests. Doctors fear speaking out against conventional guidance, the theory goes, for fear of being ostracized. That, the report says, has curtailed research into the causes of chronic disease.

“This report brings to the forefront a body of scientific research that has been largely ignored as we have been so busy as doctors in the modern health care system, billing and coding and seeing patients in short visits,” Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters in a call Thursday.

The American Medical Association did not respond to requests for comment.

Kennedy has long opposed corporate influence in the health care world and has surrounded himself with deputies, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, who gained notice for criticizing the public health establishment for government missteps during the pandemic. They’ve claimed that a culture of fear has prevented scientists and other public health experts from questioning why autism case rates have increased. 

“Scientists are often afraid to ask fundamental questions, for fear that they might get an answer that will lead to them being smeared by the press, being attacked by fellow scientists and losing their reputation,” Bhattacharya told reporters Thursday. He also called much of medical literature “unreliable.”

The review, which Trump ordered Kennedy to pursue in February to assess chronic disease among children and seek solutions, says the rise in illness is likely the result of ultraprocessed food, exposure to chemicals, lack of exercise, stress and overprescription of drugs. It says physicians who diagnose and treat children with conditions including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression are prone to “over-pathologization” of mental health issues in youth, preferring to medicate kids instead of trying to find the underlying causes of their illnesses and alleviate them.

It also criticizes industry-supported education of physicians, which it says “typically promotes drugs, encourages off-label prescribing, and contributes to polypharmacy in kids,” which occurs when they take several medications at once.

The report calls out the AMA for adopting a policy calling for licensing boards to take disciplinary action against physicians who spread misinformation, an issue that became heated during the pandemic when some sought to punish doctors who prescribed off-label treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for Covid.

Doctors often experiment in this way, but the FDA said the treatments weren’t effective and discouraged their use.

Punishing doctors for deviating from government guidance “discourages practitioners from conducting or discussing nuanced risk-benefit analyses that deviate from official guidelines — even when those analyses may be clinically appropriate,” the report says.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1748000684.0,FDA advisers recommend Covid vaccine updates to target new strains,"The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee unanimously recommended that newest vaccines for Covid should be updated to target a variant of strains currently on the rise, during a meeting on Thursday – the first since the Trump administration took office.

The meeting focused on selecting a Covid strain to target in upcoming vaccines as well as formalizing new FDA rules that limit vaccine access to Americans.

Though it was intended to help advisers recommend strains for the upcoming year’s booster shots to the FDA, the meeting came in the context of upheaval at the federal health department.

“We have a very specific and important goal,” said Arnold Monto, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and chair of the committee. “We are asking for guidance to help the FDA decide what strain to select for going forward.”

On Tuesday, Trump administration health officials announced they would take a less “aggressive” approach to booster shots and require placebo-controlled trials for healthy individuals younger than 65.

“As many of you all know, this week in the New England Journal of Medicine the commissioner and I revealed a framework for Covid-19 policy,” said Vinay Prasad, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees vaccines.

He said the new framework would generate “important and relevant information for the American people”, referring to new trial requirements.

The plan includes limiting access to Covid-19 vaccines to people 65 and older and others who are considered high-risk, as well as requiring manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines benefit healthy younger adults and children.

The FDA’s vaccines and related biological products advisory committee, a group of independent vaccine experts, concluded their all-day meeting by unanimously recommending that Covid vaccines for the 2025-2026 period target newer strains of the JN.1 variant. Although their decision is not binding, the FDA usually takes their advice.

Currently, the US has three Covid-19 vaccines approved – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax.

Typically, the FDA advisory committee would recommend formulations for shots and whether they should be approved, with a separate advisory committee at the CDC creating recommendations for who should get the shots. Trump administration officials took the unusual step of announcing a policy change rather than seeking independent guidance from its own expert committees first.

Prassad joined the FDA after the longtime vaccine head Peter Marks quit, citing Kennedy’s refusal to accept information that did not comport with his long-held opinions questioning vaccine safety.

According to the CDC, the LP.8.1 strain, a subvariant of the JN.1 strain, accounted for 70% of total cases in the US over a two-week period that ended on 10 May.

Covid-19 evolved less than in previous years, CDC microbiologist and immunologist Natalie Thornburg told the advisory committee. Most viruses currently circulating are descendants of the JN.1 virus variant, she said, though there is potential for that to be replaced. Wastewater in South Africa detected a new variant dubbed BA.3.2, which could indicate a shift in the virus. However, very few sequences of that variant have been identified globally.

Government experts presenting to the committee emphasized that Covid-19 was still causing a significant number of deaths in the US. Hospitalization rates have declined overall since 2021-2022 but are highest among people older than 65 and children younger than six months old.

Since October of last year, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people have died from the virus and between 260,000 and 430,000 have been hospitalized, according to data from the CDC.

“When you add up those cumulative rates over a 12-month period, Covid-19 is still causing an enormous burden on the US health system,” said Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist with the CDC.

Overall, almost all people in the US have experienced a Covid infection, meaning nearly everyone has some level of infection-induced immunity when vaccine efficacy was measured, but that immunity is believed to wane over time.

Vaccine-induced immunity, in this context, should be viewed as an “added benefit”, according to a CDC epidemiologist presenting to the committee.

Vaccine effectiveness could not be estimated for 2024-25 in children because of the low level of coverage and relatively low level of disease compared with earlier seasons. Last season had a lower overall rate of Covid hospitalization among children – though the youngest children notably had the worst hospitalization rates.",1kthgc4,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/22/fda-vaccine-advisory-committee-covid,149
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747971214.0,U.S. reports cases of new COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in China,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China. 

Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.

Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.

A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.

Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.

Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a ""significant increase"" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19. 

While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.

Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.

That brings the number of measles cases to 1,795 since Ontario's outbreak began last October.

The health agency's weekly measles report, released Thursday, says the virus continues to spread primarily among people who have not been immunized.

The majority of people infected with measles throughout the outbreak are infants, children and adolescents.

The report says a total of 129 people have required hospitalization, with 10 people admitted to the intensive care unit.

The Southwestern Public Health unit, which includes Oxford County, Elgin County and St. Thomas, continues to be hardest hit, with 98 of the new cases.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747923264.0,Long Island tuberculosis scare leads to testing for some students and staff,"A tuberculosis scare on Long Island led to more than 100 students and staff at a high school to get tested following an exposure.

The students and staff at Sachem High School East in Coram learned on Wednesday whether they would need treatment for tuberculosis after they were exposed to a classmate who tested positive last week.

Because the infectious disease can be present in the body without showing symptoms, school officials sent a letter on Thursday to 116 students and seven staff members, alerting them to the possible exposure and offering free testing.

""I know a couple of my friends who have classes with them they got letters. So I’m like 'Stay away a little bit,'"" said student Kaylee Dean.

Officials from the Suffolk County Health Department were at the school Monday to offer free testing to those students who may have been exposed. The district superintendent said in a letter to students and families that, as of Wednesday, there hadn't been any more cases confirmed.

""The district was informed that there have been no new confirmed cases,"" said Superintendent Patti Trombetta. ""Please be assured that we will remain in contact with the SCDOH and will share any further updates necessary.""

There is no tuberculosis vaccine in the U.S.

 Prevention is not entirely possible, but doctors stress the disease is treatable. And doctors added that any student that did not receive a letter about possible exposure do not need to worry.

""If you haven’t gotten a letter, you were clearly not in contact with the individual and you have no worries,"" said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the director of infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital. ""If caught early, we treat it and we prevent tuberculosis infection from going to tuberculosis disease. And that means everyone else will do fine.""

While parents and students have been assured there is no outbreak or further cause for concern, some wish there had been a school-wide alert sent out.

""I was just upset that they didn’t let all the parents know. Just because you’re not in a classroom with a child doesn’t mean it can’t be spread other ways,"" said Michael Dean, Kaylee's father.

According to the New York State Department of Health, there were 250 confirmed cases of tuberculosis in 2024. That was a 19% increase from 2023. Of those 250 cases, 100 were on Long Island: 52 in Suffolk County, 48 in Nassau County.

The school district said they will wait for a two-month incubation period to pass, and they will offer testing to the same students. It is set to occur sometime in July.",1ksrs75,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/long-island/students-staff-long-island-school-tested-tuberculosis-exposure-scare/6273792/,53
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747923450.0,"As Bird Flu Spreads, Vaccine Shows Promise for Protecting Cattle","Since bird flu was first discovered in U.S. cattle last year, the virus has spread to more than 1,000 herds across the country. A new vaccine for cattle has performed well in early tests, raising hopes that it could protect livestock and help prevent an outbreak in humans.

New research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that calves administered an experimental bird flu vaccine made protective antibodies. When later fed milk from infected cattle, the vaccinated calves showed lower levels of the virus than unvaccinated calves.

“I don’t think that cattle vaccines on their own are sort of a silver bullet,” said Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert affiliated with the World Health Organization, who was not involved in the new research. “But we have to do something different because what we’re doing now is clearly not working,” he told Nature.

Since 2024, U.S. officials have recorded more than 60 cases of the virus in humans, including the first U.S. death, in January. Scott Hensley of the University of Pennsylvania, coauthor of the new research, told Nature that the virus poses a “real pandemic threat.” Globally, roughly half of people infected with bird flu have died.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has cleared at least seven experimental livestock vaccines for trials this year, and in February it conditionally approved a vaccine for chickens. Since 2022, bird flu has killed more than 170 million farmed birds in the U.S. alone.",1ksruug,https://e360.yale.edu/digest/bird-flu-vaccine-cattle,17
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747835314.0,Diseases are spreading. The CDC isn't warning the public like it was months ago,"To accomplish its mission of increasing the health security of the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that it ""conducts critical science and provides health information"" to protect the nation. But since President Trump's administration assumed power in January, many of the platforms the CDC used to communicate with the public have gone silent, an NPR analysis found.

Many of the CDC's newsletters have stopped being distributed, workers at the CDC say. Health alerts about disease outbreaks, previously sent to health professionals subscribed to the CDC's Health Alert Network, haven't been dispatched since March. The agency's main social media channels have come under new ownership of the Department of Health and Human Services, emails reviewed by NPR show, and most have gone more than a month without posting their own new content.

""Public health functions best when its experts are allowed to communicate the work that they do in real time, and that's not happening,"" said Kevin Griffis, who served as the director of communications at the CDC until March. ""That could put people's lives at risk.""

Health emergencies have not paused since January. Cases of measles, salmonella, listeria and hepatitis A and C have spread throughout the country. More than 100 million Americans continue to suffer from chronic diseases like diabetes and breast cancer. The decline in the agency's communication could put people at risk, said four current and former CDC workers, three of whom NPR is allowing to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the CDC and believe they may be punished for speaking out.

""We are functionally unable to operate communications,"" said one of the CDC workers. ""We feel like our hands are tied behind our backs.""

Before Trump was inaugurated, the CDC managed most of its communication. HHS, the agency that oversees the CDC and more than 20 divisions and agencies, rarely reviewed the content in CDC social media posts or newsletters, CDC workers said.

That allowed the CDC to communicate quickly and often.

""The whole goal is to say, this is what we know. And here are the best recommendations from experts in the field,"" said Dr. Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. ""And this is the best advice about the way the general population should handle things in order to protect their health.""

The CDC's communication staff dispersed health messages weekly, monthly and quarterly through a network of more than 150 newsletters about topics like arthritis, diabetes and food safety. The CDC distributed those newsletters to tens of thousands of subscribers, CDC employees said, including clinicians and laboratories that relied on the information to care for patients.

Facts from those dispatches were often shared on social media. Information from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's publication of public health information and recommendations, was regularly posted across the CDC's main social platforms, like on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.

Scientists and other communication professionals at the CDC could also suggest other health facts to be posted on the agency's main platforms. Those sorts of posts included information on X about topics like how COVID-19 was spreading in 2020, posts on Facebook about how to prevent bacterial infections and posts across platforms about how to get screened for chronic illnesses, like cancers.

The messages quickly reached a wide audience. More than 12 million people subscribe to the CDC's main Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn accounts.

""Social media is one of the main ways the CDC communicates plain language, life-saving messages to America,"" said one CDC employee.

But now, many of those messages have stopped being sent out. Changes to communication at the CDC began shortly after Trump was inaugurated in January, when HHS instructed the CDC and other health agencies to pause any sort of collaboration with people outside the agency.

""So at that point we stopped pretty much all communications,"" said a CDC employee who works at the agency.

The pause affected some of the CDC's most essential publications. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's regularly published write-up of important new public health research and disease outbreak information, was not released for two weeks after Trump was inaugurated. No report was published on Jan. 23, the first Friday after the inauguration, or on Jan. 30, the second Friday.

The unprecedented break in publication of the weekly reports concerned some subscribers.

""It stopped publishing at the height of the bird flu outbreak and at the beginning of the measles outbreak,"" said Guest, the epidemiology professor at Emory, who said she's been reading the report every week since she was a graduate student. ""And so it's really a time when we want to get that very consistent and very important and scientifically sound information, and it was all shut down.""

The reports resumed on Friday Feb. 6, around the time workers at the CDC were told they could resume some meetings with external partners, CDC employees said. But the way the facts inside have been shared with the public has not returned to how it was. Communications have not been handled in-house by CDC scientists and communicators like before. All posts that CDC workers want to make to their agency's social media accounts have to be reviewed by HHS, employees at the CDC said.

""What we're being told is that, no, your channels aren't going to go back."" said a CDC employee.

**Trump administration restricts CDC research and messaging with layers of oversight**

On April 24, some employees were sent an email from a supervisor that confirmed that HHS now owned the CDC's main social media platforms, including its X, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts.

""We were also notified that HHS is not accepting content for those channels at this time,"" the email added.

In response to a request for comment regarding the changes to communication practices at the CDC, the director of communications at HHS, Andrew Nixon, cast doubt on what the workers said.

""It's unfortunate to see career officials spreading false rumors,"" Nixon replied.

Since HHS approval was instituted as a requirement for posting, almost no newsletters have been sent to the tens of thousands of people who subscribe to them, CDC workers said. The last update sent out by the CDC's Health Alert Network was regarding the risk of dengue infection on March 18, even though outbreaks of salmonella and listeria were acknowledged in May by the CDC on its website.

When CDC publications have gone out, some have been delayed or missing information. A recent release of CDC data regarding the prevalence of HIV in the U.S. cautioned that it ""does not include data on PrEP coverage,"" referring to medication taken by individuals to prevent HIV infection. ""CDC is unable to resume PrEP coverage at this time, due to a reduction in force affecting the Division of HIV Prevention (DHP).""

Two CDC employees who work in communications told NPR that fewer than half of the public health posts they've sent to HHS for approval have been cleared for publication on social media. Even posts that include basic information about recent disease outbreaks, like the number of people sickened or hospitalized, have not been posted as requested by employees, NPR confirmed after reviewing posts submitted for approval by an employee. Communications workers say they are also suggesting fewer health posts because they anticipate that their posts will be rejected.

""Everything is getting bottlenecked at the top,"" said a worker. ""It is extraordinarily time-consuming and backlogs us by weeks, if not months.""

The consequences could be deadly, experts said.

""When you have an outbreak of something like listeria, if you are a person who is pregnant and you consume food items that might have listeria in it that CDC should be warning you about, you run the risk of the baby that you are carrying dying,"" said Guest. ""And so that information needs to get out there.""

**""Propaganda"" instead of public health**

On April 1, thousands of federal health workers were laid off as part of the government's ""reduction in force."" Communication professionals at the CDC were not spared. Almost everyone at the CDC whose primary job was to communicate with the press was laid off, in addition to almost everyone whose job it was to provide records to the public. Every member of the CDC's division of digital media was also told their jobs would be eliminated, workers at the CDC said.

""All the points of contact that we generally rely on to communicate with the American people have either been eliminated or dramatically reduced,"" said Griffis, the former CDC communications director.

Removing all the CDC's web developers, graphic designers and social media staffers simultaneously caused a problem. The CDC was suddenly locked out of its main social media accounts, said three people close to the situation.

""The passwords to those accounts were kept on a password protected Word doc,"" said one worker at the CDC. ""And that Word doc was inaccessible for anyone left, because all of the people that could have opened that document were fired.""

Most of the main accounts haven't posted since the CDC's digital media team was laid off. During March, the CDC's main Facebook page posted more than 20 times—sometimes twice a day. The posts included information for pregnant women about how to take care of their developing babies and screenings for colorectal cancer.

The only main CDC account that has posted some content since April 1 is the CDC's account on X, a platform owned by Elon Musk. He oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, the organization that spearheaded efforts to lay off tens of thousands of workers across federal agencies.

On April 7, workers at the CDC said they were surprised to see the CDC's main X account post a tweet for the first time in a week.

""Secretary Kennedy's directive is for CDC to lead the nation in health readiness and response,"" the post stated, sharing a message from Kennedy's own X account about his visit to Gaines County, Texas. ""His visit to Texas Sunday, to support the state's efforts to control the measles outbreak, resulted in discussions with Texas state health officials to deploy another CDC response team to the area to further assist with the state's efforts to protect its citizens against measles and its complications.""

No one they knew had drafted the message, the CDC employees said. Compared to the science and health information that had traditionally been posted to the accounts, three of the current workers at the CDC that NPR spoke with said they considered the post about Kennedy to be akin to ""propaganda.""

Griffis, the former communications director, said there's nothing wrong with retweeting a cabinet secretary.

""What's undermines the credibility of CDC communications moving forward is the near cessation of pro-vaccination and apolitical public health messages in favor of messages that amplify the secretary,"" he said. ""That makes it a political channel.""

Since posting about Kennedy's visit to Texas in early April, the CDC's main X account has re-posted two more tweets from Kennedy's account and re-posted one tweet from the HHS X account, which contradicted a CBS News story. On May 14, the account posted about a recent decline in overdose deaths. By comparison, during the month of April last year, in 2024, the CDC's main X account posted more than 90 times, offering advice and information about topics like alcohol use, a salmonella outbreak, COVID-19 vaccines and wastewater surveillance.

The director of communications at HHS confirmed that the CDC is not locked out of its X account.

""The CDC has access to their X account - it's that simple,"" Nixon said. ""CDC is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and supports Secretary Kennedy's vision to protect public health and Make America Healthy Again.""

Nixon did not respond to a request for comment regarding whether the CDC was still locked out of its other main social media accounts.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747864026.0,England to begin vaccination program to prevent gonorrhea,"England's National Health Service (NHS) announced today that it is set to launch a vaccination campaign against gonorrhea this summer.

Starting in early August, eligible patients, including gay and bisexual men who have a recent history of multiple sexual partners or a sexually transmitted infection (STI), will be able to receive an existing vaccine for meningococcal B disease (4CMenB) at local authority-commissioned sexual health clinics to prevent gonorrhea. The decision is based on a recommendation from the United Kingdom's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

Multiple studies have shown that the 4CMenB vaccine, which protects against four serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis, also provides moderate cross-protection against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with vaccine effectiveness ranging from 30% to 40%. A 2002 analysis led by researchers at Imperial College London estimated that vaccinating those at greatest risk of gonorrhea infection would avert 110,000 cases and save the NHS £7.9 million (US $10.6 million) over 10 years.

**Surge in gonorrhea cases**

The move comes amid a surge in gonorrhea infections in England. The 85,000 cases in 2023 were three times the number reported in 2012 and the most since UK officials began tracking gonorrhea cases in 1918. It's the second most commonly diagnosed STI in the country.

""This vaccination programme is a hugely welcome intervention at a time when we're seeing very concerning levels of gonorrhoea, including antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea,"" Sema Mandel, MBBS, consultant epidemiologist and deputy director at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said in an NHS press release. UKHSA is supporting the rollout of the program. 

""Not only will this rollout provide much needed protection to those that need it most, but it will make the UK the first country in the world to offer this protection and a world leader in protecting people against gonorrhoea.""

NHS says local providers will identify and contact those eligible for vaccination through sexual health services.",1ksa4sv,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/gonorrhea/england-begin-vaccination-program-prevent-gonorrhea?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKbKPNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuPnWzufamFiUerXnldOR_x453PAxNsc-98rDgYQ-aDPog9HbnA8ulf65xmJ_aem_LP6w2C_RmNlrymPmaMUTqQ,45
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747846942.0,"Covid-19 vaccines, what just happened at the FDA, and why it matters (via YLE)","Yesterday, the FDA Commissioner, Marty Makary, and his new advisor, Vinay Prasad, unveiled a major shift in U.S. Covid-19 vaccine policy—via a New England Journal of Medicine perspective piece and a live FDA event.

Their bottom line: Going forward, Covid-19 vaccines will only be recommended for people over 65 or with at least one chronic condition. If manufacturers want to offer updated vaccines to younger adults, they must run a new placebo-controlled trial after a variant arrives. Their rationale is that, given higher levels of population immunity, the original trials are no longer relevant. Vinay followed up by saying, “This is a restoration of trust. It’s bringing us back to evidence.”

On the surface, this sounds reasonable. After all, severe Covid-19 is far less common in healthy young people. Given growing immunity, real scientific questions exist about whether annual boosters are still warranted for everyone. And, yes, other countries do things differently.

But beneath the surface, this move is deeply troubling. It bypasses the scientific systems built to answer these questions, replacing the public process in health policy with the opinions of two political appointees with chips on their shoulders.

Scientific questions deserve a scientific process.
Reassessing Covid-19 vaccine policy isn’t new. In fact, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—a group of independent scientists, doctors, and public health experts—has been doing exactly that, using evolving real-world data as the virus changes and immunity shifts.

While early decisions relied on placebo-controlled trials, that approach became impractical as variants emerged quickly. Instead, ACIP adapted—reviewing real-world data on protection, safety, and impact. Each year, they evaluated whether annual vaccines were providing meaningful added protection. And each year, the data said yes—especially for high-risk groups, but also across broader populations. ACIP also considers other factors, including equity, accessibility, ease of implementation, and cost effectiveness.

ACIP was already scheduled to revisit these recommendations this June. (YLE covered this in detail at the last ACIP meeting.)

**How vaccine policy should be made**

In normal times, the U.S. vaccine process works like this:

FDA Approval. Once a vaccine goes through clinical trials, an external advisory committee of experts (called VRBPAC) and FDA assess whether a vaccine is safe and effective. Then that vaccine is given a license. Thereafter, for fast-mutating viruses like flu or Covid they decide whether a vaccine formula needs to be updated based on evolving data.

CDC Recommendation. ACIP then reviews how the vaccine should be used: who should get it, when, and how often. Insurance companies use this recommendation to cover vaccine costs for you. Then the CDC Director signs off.

This process is public, deliberative, and based on evidence, ethics, and implementation factors. As STAT pointed out yesterday, during the pandemic, Makary posted on X that making a 2022 decision about Covid vaccines without holding an FDA advisory committee was “unconscionable.”

Yet, here we are. This decision was made without a VRBPAC vote. No ACIP meeting. No new data. No transparency or public discussion. Two FDA appointees decided the Covid-19 vaccine policy needed to change.

This matters for several reasons:

**It undermines the evidence-based process.**

Makary and Prasad—neither of whom is a vaccinologist or has experience leading vaccine policymaking—circumvented the rigorous, transparent system in place. This was neither collaborative nor grounded in new evidence. There was no urgent reason to bypass that process. VRBPAC meets this Thursday, just two days after this announcement.

**It preempts ACIP’s scheduled review.**

ACIP was already preparing to formally reassess Covid-19 vaccine guidance in June. ACIP could still recommend Covid-19 vaccination for younger Americans, even off-label, as has happened with other vaccines like Tdap and flu. But that normally happens in lockstep with FDA—not in conflict. This time, FDA’s move feels like a dare: “Go ahead. Try to contradict us.” If ACIP pushes back, they risk appearing divided— losing public trust and causing confusion. And, in the end, RFK Jr. would likely overrule ACIP anyway, so is this a hill to die on? It’s an impossible decision.

It’s impractical—and unethical.

FDA’s new proposal would require placebo-controlled trials for healthy young adults every time a new variant emerges. But it’s already spreading by the time a new variant is identified. Public health uses predictive modeling (like the flu model) to stay ahead and be proactive (rather than reactive). This is also unethical and not feasible. Scientists can’t give people a saline placebo when we know a vaccine offers protection. No ethical review board would approve this. Also, running an RCT in the seasonal timeframe is unrealistic.

**So what does this mean for you?**

If you’re under 65 and don’t have a chronic condition, there’s a very real chance you won’t have access to a Covid-19 vaccine this fall. Much depends on what happens next month. ACIP could defy the FDA and recommend vaccines for broader use, but that would be risky. We’ve never been in this situation before.

If this FDA policy goes through, the eligible chronic conditions are below.

Interestingly, some groups are missing despite extensive evidence of their high risk. For example, overweight individuals and caregivers are missing, but a common recommendation in other countries.


**Bottom line**

This isn’t about whether everyone needs a yearly Covid-19 vaccine—that’s a legitimate, ongoing scientific debate, and one ACIP was already tackling in June.

This is about how decisions are made—and who gets to make them. FDA political appointees are sidelining expert panels, bypassing transparency, and turning public health into a performance. That might fly in other arenas, but shouldn’t when it comes to people’s health and daily lives.

Vaccine decisions must be rooted in evidence, debate, and transparency.

If this is the new model, we should all be alarmed.",1ks328z,https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccines-what-just-happened?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKa5fdjbGNrAprl8WV4dG4DYWVtAjExAAEeMUcqLEkkDRRpY7dti5zGxjexSd3jrLz3Uc-wbRpDZVITZDnsQbz-V_47Bos_aem_kL0L-Ylkt1eSf6nTxtuatw,105
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747852129.0,West Nile virus detected in UK mosquitoes for first time,"West Nile virus, which mainly spreads between birds but can also infect people if they're bitten by an infected mosquito, has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, UK health officials say.

Although the virus can sometimes make people seriously ill, there is no evidence it is spreading in the UK and the risk to the general public is ""very low"", the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.

The virus is found in many parts of the world, including Africa, South America and mainland Europe.

Climate change and other factors have been pushing mosquitoes - and the diseases they carry - further north in recent years.

West Nile virus causes either very minor symptoms or none at all - but around 20% of infected people can experience headaches, high fever and skin issues. In rare cases, it can kill through serious brain illnesses, including encephalitis or meningitis.

No specific treatment or vaccines exist for humans.

To date, there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK - although, since 2000, there have been seven cases of the disease linked to travel to other countries.

West Nile virus is usually present in several regions across the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, South America and Europe, and has expanded in recent years.

Research by the UKHSA and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) found fragments of the virus in mosquitoes collected at ponds near Retford, Nottinghamshire in 2023.

""While this is the first detection of West Nile Virus in mosquitoes in the UK so far, it is not unexpected as the virus is already widespread in Europe,"" said Dr Meera Chand, a deputy director for travel health and infections at UKHSA. 

Dr Arran Folly, who led the project which found the virus, said its detection is part of a ""wider changing landscape, where, in the wake of climate change mosquito-borne diseases are expanding to new areas"".

While the Aedes vexans mosquito is native to Britain, he added that warming temperatures may bring non-native species to the UK and, with them, the potential of infectious disease.

Prof James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the development was ""serious"" but there was no need for the public to be alarmed.

He said surveillance systems were in place to monitor increased mosquito activity and shifting bird migration caused by warmer weather.

""But as conditions change, we need to stay one step ahead,"" he said.

""This is a moment to recognise that the UK is no longer immune to some diseases once considered 'tropical'.""

Prof Logan said the virus is likely to have arrived via an infected bird or mosquito, which can both travel considerable distances during seasonal migration.

Chihuahua is the state with the highest number of cases and deaths from the measles virus.

According to Excélsior's online edition, the Ministry of Health reported the deaths of two minors, one 7 years old and the other 11 months old, due to complications from measles. This brings the total to three deaths from the same cause in 2025.

In these new cases, both children had pneumonia, one had leukemia, and the other had kidney disease.

The children, originally from Namiquipa and Ojinaga, belonged to the Mennonite community, and neither had been vaccinated against the disease.

 In the case of the 11-month-old, the mother was also unvaccinated, so she could not transmit immunity to the infant.

Once these cases were reported to the General Directorate of Epidemiology in Mexico City, an official report was issued after analysis.

Health officials hailed the treaty, a goal of which is to enable the more equitable distribution of vaccines and treatments, as a historic milestone. Countries reached agreement on its terms last month after more than three years of negotiations, kicking off in late 2021 as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus swept around the world and underscored the gulf in vaccine availability between wealthy and developing nations.

But the treaty’s successes are dimmed by the departure from the negotiations earlier this year of the United States, once the Trump administration moved to withdraw the country and its funding from the WHO. The issue was not broached Monday as dozens of countries discussed their views on the treaty here at the annual meeting of WHO’s member states, before they ultimately voted to endorse the treaty late Monday. Among the countries that voted, 124 supported the treaty, 11 abstained, and none opposed it. 

“The agreement is a victory for public health, science, and multilateral action,” Tedros Adhanom. 

 Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said Tuesday at the World Health Assembly, marking the formal adoption of the treaty. “It will ensure we, collectively, can better protect the world from future pandemic threats. It is also a recognition by the international community that our citizens, societies, and economies must not be left vulnerable to again suffer losses like those endured during Covid-19.”
Yet there is more work to be done.

 Countries are still negotiating the details for how a country is meant to share samples and sequences of pathogens it discovers within its borders, and access to the response tools — including vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests — that are developed with that information. The plan is to have manufacturers donate or sell at low prices 20% of what they make. 
Delegates said they hoped to have the provision finalized by next year’s assembly. 

Member states also still need to ratify the treaty, and there are outstanding questions about how closely countries and drugmakers will follow the strategies in the pact. 

But it is only the second time that WHO’s member states have reached such a legal agreement, following a tobacco control effort more than 20 years ago. The wrangling over the pandemic treaty lasted a year past the original target date.

“In a time of growing geopolitical tensions and seismic changes, this agreement is proof that the world is still together,” Precious Matsoso, a South African regulatory expert who co-chaired the negotiating body, said Monday. “It is a strong signal that multilateralism is not being treated in ICU, because we see before us that countries have raised their voices and demonstrated that the international community of nations still matters.”

The treaty aims to strengthen global health security by outlining steps that countries should take to prevent potential pandemics — for example, by reducing the risk of pathogens spilling from animals to people — and to get ready for future health crises. It touches on improving support and access to personal protective equipment for health care workers, encourages drugmakers to share the recipes for making their products with manufacturers in the developing world, and promotes the rapid sharing of data about emerging diseases.

“Within its provisions lies a promise — access for all to vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and other pandemic health products; sustained investment in our health workforces; equitable sharing of knowledge; and innovation through research and development,” said Teodoro Herbosa, the health secretary of the Philippines. He added that it was “a product not of imposition, but of painstaking dialogue across differences, indeed a signal of hope in the divided world.”

Some experts have criticized the pact for not going far enough in guaranteeing that vaccine manufacturers will have to supply more doses to developing countries sooner, and for not including enforcement mechanisms or more resources for developing countries to bolster their health security. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747757859.0,"FDA to limit covid shot approval to elderly, those with medical conditions","The Food and Drug Administration unveiled plans Tuesday to narrow its approval for updated coronavirus vaccines to older adults and people with at least one health condition that puts them at high risk for severe disease, marking a significant shift in the agency’s approach to green-lighting the shots.
The new guidelines indicate updated vaccines will probably be available in the fall for Americans over the age of 65, as well as those older than 6 months who have at least one condition putting them at higher risk of severe illness, as well as people with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer and obesity, in addition to pregnant women. Top FDA leaders estimate over 100 million Americans would be eligible for the shots under the new framework. In past years, the shots have been broadly recommended, including to children and otherwise generally healthy Americans.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad, who was recently tapped as FDA’s top regulator of vaccines, detailed the new approach in a New England Journal of Medicine article released Tuesday morning. The change — which top Trump health officials had earlier forecasted in vaguer terms — comes just two days before the agency’s independent advisers are set to make recommendations on selecting the formula that vaccine makers should use to potentially adjust their shots to target the strain of the coronavirus currently circulating in the country.

The new framework will also require vaccine makers to conduct a randomized controlled trial before the agency signs off on a coronavirus shot for healthy people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years. When possible, the agency will “encourage manufacturers” to complete such trials after they get the agency’s approval for a vaccine for high risk groups, a potentially expensive endeavor.

“The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,” Makary and Prasad wrote. “These clinical trials will inform future directions for the FDA, but more important, they will provide information that is desperately craved by health care providers and the American people.”
About 74 percent of adults have at least one condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness from covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Prasad recently replaced Peter Marks, an architect of the U.S. program to rapidly develop coronavirus vaccines and whom the Trump administration forced out in late March.

Federal health officials had already been weighing limiting recommendations for a coronavirus shot to older adults and high-risk individuals. But that change was set to come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is charged with developing recommendations for which populations should get the shots. The FDA is tasked with reviewing the safety and efficacy of vaccines, approving the shots and creating regulatory frameworks for drugs and vaccines.

Five years after the coronavirus first launched mass shutdowns and a global health emergency, health experts say many more Americans have protection against the disease either through natural infection or multiple vaccinations. While the virus still causes significant health impacts for certain individuals, covid-19 is now less deadly.

Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he always believed updated shots should have been targeted toward high-risk groups, such as the way some other countries approach the vaccines.

“I don't have any major objection to it other than the fact that I think that we need to have a discussion about routine childhood immunization,” he said.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has questioned the testing of vaccine safety for coronavirus shots, introducing uncertainty over whether an updated shot would be available in the fall. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary and founder of a prominent anti-vaccine group, has said he intends to shift the way vaccines are tested, a notion that has sparked concern among medical experts who say the United States has one of the most rigorous vaccine safety systems and that doing so could limit access to lifesaving shots.
Kennedy has a long history of disparaging vaccines, including falsely calling the coronavirus shot “the deadliest ever made.” Kennedy has countered that he is simply seeking good data about vaccines, and his health department has since taken aim at reexamining coronavirus vaccines.

Several vaccine experts have pointed to the Trump administration’s restrictions on Novavax’s shot as a sign for how it would approach annual updates to the more widely used vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

On Friday, the FDA granted a narrow approval to Novavax’s coronavirus vaccine, but with stricter conditions than usual. The use is limited to older adults as well as those 12 to 64 years old who have at least one health condition putting them at higher risk of severe illness. The FDA is also seeking for the company to conduct a number of studies, including a new clinical trial.

The company’s shot has been available under emergency use authorization since 2022 and is the only vaccine that uses a more traditional protein base instead of messenger RNA — an appealing option to some who have reactions to mRNA shots. But the approval ultimately granted to the company differs from how the agency had initially planned to handle the company’s vaccine.

FDA was on track to grant full approval to the vaccine April 1 for Americans 12 years and older, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. But top Trump FDA officials told agency regulators to pause the approval, the people said — a move that sparked alarm from some vaccine experts who said it amounted to political interference into decisions generally left to career staff who review reams of data.

“The FDA, in some ways, has usurped the role of the CDC by making a recommendation” on Novavax, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the panel of FDA’s expert vaccine advisers.

The CDC’s vaccine advisory panel is scheduled to meet June 25 to vote on a coronavirus vaccine recommendation for the fall. Members are expected to be asked to vote to replace the current universal covid vaccination recommendation with the more targeted one outlined by the FDA. The panel could also vote to allow other people who would like to get the shot if they wanted one. Once the recommendations are approved by the CDC director, they become official U.S. policy, and insurance companies are required to cover the cost of the shots with no out-of-pocket charges to consumers.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747755493.0,RFK Jr. calls for global health cooperation outside the World Health Organization,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday called on other countries to work with the U.S. on global health outside of the World Health Organization, as he rejected the pandemic agreement WHO members just adopted.

“We want to free international health cooperation from the straitjacket of political interference by corrupting influences of the pharmaceutical companies, of adversarial nations and their [non-governmental organization] proxies,” Kennedy said in prerecorded video remarks aired Tuesday at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, an annual gathering of top health officials from WHO member countries. The WHO is an arm of the United Nations, and the U.S. has long been its biggest financial supporter.

But President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the organization on his first day in office and stopped paying dues. Kennedy said the Trump administration is in contact with like-minded countries interested in cooperating outside the WHO, which works to combat disease across the world, and encouraged others to join them.

“Global cooperation on health is still critically important to President Trump and myself, but it isn’t working very well under the WHO, as the failures of the Covid era demonstrate,” Kennedy added.

Trump, who believes the pandemic began with an accident at a Chinese government virology lab, blames the WHO for helping to cover it up.

Kennedy accused the WHO of caving to pressure from China to suppress reports that the coronavirus that caused the pandemic was transmitted among humans, in the early days of the outbreak.

The health secretary also alleged that the WHO “worked with China to promote the fiction that Covid originated from bats or pangolins, rather than from Chinese government-sponsored research at a biolab in Wuhan.”

The WHO has rejected both accusations. And while three U.S. agencies — the Department of Energy, the FBI and the CIA — have said a lab leak likely caused the pandemic, there’s no scientific consensus about it, with many virologists still pointing to a spillover of the virus from animals to humans as more plausible.

[...] 

Kennedy also criticized the newly adopted pandemic agreement meant to prevent and better prepare countries for future disease outbreaks. The agreement “will lock in all of the dysfunctions of the WHO pandemic response,” Kennedy said, adding that the U.S. will not participate in it.

**“We need to reboot the whole system, as we are doing in the United States,” he added.**

Kennedy touted the priorities he’s brought to U.S. health agencies, tasking them with combating chronic diseases; removing artificial dyes from food; reducing consumption of ultra-processed food and seeking the causes of autism and other chronic diseases.

“We’re going to support lifestyle changes that will bolster the immune systems and transform the health of our people,” he said, adding that “few of these efforts lend themselves easily to profits or serve established special interests.”",1kr7zal,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/20/rfk-jr-pandemic-covid-china-un-00358464,19

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747538859.0,F.D.A. Approves Novavax Covid Vaccine With Stricter New Conditions,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and for others over age 12 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk from Covid.

Scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who typically make decisions on who should get approved shots and when, have been debating whether to recommend Covid shots only to the most vulnerable Americans. The F.D.A.’s decision appeared to render at least part of their discussion moot.

The new restriction will sharply limit access to the Novavax vaccine for people under 65 who are in good health. It may leave Americans who do not have underlying conditions at risk if a more virulent version of the coronavirus were to emerge. It could also limit options for people who want the vaccine for a wide array of reasons, including to protect a vulnerable loved one. 

The vaccine had previously been authorized under emergency use. Covid vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which are more widely used by Americans, were granted full approval in 2022. However, the companies are working on updated shots for the fall, and the new restrictions on the Novavax shot portend a more restrictive approach from the F.D.A.

The F.D.A.’s new restrictions also appeared to reflect the high degree of skepticism about vaccines from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and the other leaders he has appointed at health agencies.

“This is incredibly disappointing,” said Dr. Camille Kotton, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who cares for immunocompromised patients, and a former adviser to the C.D.C.

”I don’t know why they would make this restriction; I don’t know of any indication to make this change,” Dr. Kotton said, adding that many people are still hospitalized and dying as a result of Covid. “This is a dark day in American medicine.”

 [...] 
The new restrictions on the shot could create a raft of problems for those who want the vaccine. For one, the approval document is unclear about what qualifies as an underlying condition. Prescribing the shots in healthy people under 65 would be considered off-label use, making it less likely that insurers would broadly cover the shots.

”I think we’re left confused about what this means for the consumer,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the F.D.A.

“I think the goal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is to make vaccines less available, more expensive and more feared,” Dr. Offit said. “His goal is to tear away at the vaccine infrastructure, because he believes that vaccines are not beneficial and are only harmful.”

Approval of the Novavax Covid shot also bucks norms that have been in place since the vaccines were first approved. This is the first time that the F.D.A. has included health criteria for Covid shots. Those decisions are typically made by the C.D.C.’s advisers.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747504620.0,Measles Is Just the Start,"It’s hard to keep up with Canada’s measles outbreak. Last month, the federal health database reported more than 1,500 cases across the country. More recent stats from Public Health Ontario counted more than 1,400 cases and 100 hospitalizations in Ontario alone. Of these, some 70 per cent are in Southwestern Ontario, 95 per cent of patients are unvaccinated and most all can be traced back to last fall, where a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick unknowingly became a superspreader event that’s still unfolding today.

Many people from the Mennonite community, if and when they decide to seek medical attention, come to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital in St. Thomas, Ontario, about a half hour south of London. 

There, they’ll find chief of paediatrics Asmaa Hussain, leading her team through a measles outbreak she never thought she’d see in her lifetime in this part of the world. Declining vaccination rates have caused the return of the highly contagious disease: just 83 per cent of Canadian children have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, whereas herd immunity requires 95 per cent to prevent outbreaks. 

Here, Hussain describes what it’s like to manage measles on the ground, if she’s ever successfully swayed people to vaccinate, and whether the end is near. 

**St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital has been in the thick of a measles outbreak for a few months now. What’s it like in there? **

Since the end of November, we’ve admitted 17 patients with measles, two adults and 15 children. They’ve been spread over multiple months, so we haven’t had a significant overload of patients, but those that we do have require a significant amount of care. Each patient needs their own special negative pressure room that ensures the infection doesn’t spread throughout the hospital. March had our highest number of admissions, with nine patients, and now we’re trending down. Hopefully we’re through the worst of it here, but I don’t know. Nobody does.  [...] 

**Do you remember the first time you saw a case of measles?**

I’d seen measles in Iraq before I came to Canada in 2007, but lots of doctors here have never seen it. For them, seeing the first measles patient was like, Oh my god. Knowing that patient has inevitably been in contact with many other people, you know that more cases are coming.

As for this outbreak, I saw the first case at the very end of November. I was on call at the hospital when a patient—a child—came in with respiratory problems. When I assessed him, I noticed an odd rash that looked very uncommon. I asked if they’d had any contact with someone with measles, and they said, “No.” I asked the patient if they were vaccinated, they said, “No.” So I checked with Public Health Ontario, who gave me the names of two reported cases two weeks earlier. I went back to this child’s parents, who confirmed those two reported cases were their neighbours. They said, “Oh, yes, but that was two weeks ago so we were safe.” I eventually found out they’d visited these neighbours a few days ago. 

**Seriously?! Were they deliberately lying to you or just clueless or what?**

I’m not sure, but this kind of thing happens a lot. People interact with other people assuming they’re safe. Sometimes people are in denial. There’s definitely an element of guilt. People will say they took a level of precaution that they really didn’t, and they’ll only tell their doctor or come into the hospital when things have gotten bad. All of these are factors about why they didn’t admit to contact until I specifically asked about it. 

**Does that mean there’s a whole cohort of people and kids who had or have measles and we’ll never know?**

Absolutely. The number of measles cases that we have in hospitals is probably barely scratching the surface. We suspect there’s a massive amount—multiples and multiples and multiples of who we actually see. For a lot of the admissions, we did, in fact, ask if and where there’d been measles exposure, and the parent would say, “Yes, my seven other children all had measles at home three weeks ago.” Many people will never get tested and never seek medical help and continue to spread the disease, knowingly or otherwise. 

**How are you not more frustrated? I would be infuriated.**

Sometimes people make poor choices, but doctors have to treat the patient just the same. And while it’s true that a lot of the Mennonite community is unimmunized, I see people from all walks of life who have decided not to vaccinate. Vaccination rates over the last decade have been getting worse everywhere, including in Mennonite communities, and vaccine hesitancy has increased, especially since COVID. Mennonites are a bigger, more recognizable group that often chooses not to vaccinate. But I see all kinds of families who don’t vaccinate their children.

[...] 

**Have you ever successfully changed someone’s mind about vaccines?**

No. I have the discussion all the time, and I’ve convinced vaccine-hesitant people who are on the fence and willing to listen and learn, but that’s it. Even for those who get measles, a mild case often serves to vindicate their ideas that it’s a simple infection and doctors are making too big of a deal over it. If the case is severe enough that they come to the hospital, they figure they’ve had it now anyway and won’t get it again. We’re lucky that we haven’t had any deaths from measles, and it’s true that most people will be fine, but what about the people that won’t be fine? We need to protect everyone, especially children. 

**What’s been the hardest part of the outbreak for you?**

The hardest part is the “what if.” What if polio is next? What if it’s a bacterial infection causing meningitis? There are many vaccine-preventable diseases that are much more serious than measles—which is already serious itself—in that they cause widespread disabilities and deaths in children. So, the hardest part for me is worrying about if this is a sign of what’s to come.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747500650.0,Ontario changes measles vaccine eligibility for children amid growing outbreak,"Ontario has adjusted its guidelines for the measles vaccine amid a growing outbreak of the contagious disease.

As of Friday, young children can get their shots even earlier.

The Ministry of Health said babies, between six months and one-year-old, are now eligible to get the measles vaccine.

They are also recommending **that children, from one-years-old to four-years-old, get their second dose as a soon as possible. Previously, the were eligible after their fourth birthday.**

Adults born in 1970 or later, who have not had their two measles vaccines, are urged to get another dose.

According to the latest update from Public Health Ontario, 1,622 measles cases were reported in the province between Oct. 18, 2024 and May 13, 2025.

The majority of those infections, approximately 76.3 per cent, were in infants, children or adolescents.

Public Health Ontario said more than 95 per cent of them were also unimmunized.

In Waterloo Region, there have been 59 confirmed or possible cases of measles since Oct. 28, 2024, with 11 news cases since the May 6 update from the province. Two confirmed illnesses resulted in the closure of Eastwood Collegiate Institute and St. Mary’s Catholic Secondary School this week.

The virus’ activity in Hong Kong is now “quite high,” Albert Au, head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the city’s Center for Health Protection, told local media this week. The percentage of respiratory samples testing Covid-positive in Hong Kong recently reached its highest in a year.

Severe cases - including deaths - also reached its highest level in about a year to 31 in the week through May 3, the center’s data shows. While the resurgence is yet to match the infection peaks seen in the past two years, rising viral load found in sewage water and Covid-related medical consultations and hospitalizations suggest the virus is actively spreading in the city of over 7 million people.

Rival financial hub Singapore is also on Covid alert. The city-state’s health ministry released its first update on infection numbers in almost a year this month, as the estimated number of cases jumped 28% to 14,200 in the week through May 3 from the previous seven days while daily hospitalization rose around 30%. Singapore now only provides case updates when there is a noticeable spike.

While the increase in cases could be due to factors including waning population immunity, there is no indication that the circulating variants are more transmissible — or cause more severe cases — than during the pandemic, Singapore’s health ministry said.

The surge in two of Asia’s biggest cities comes as Covid has risen across the region in the past few months, with waves of the now-endemic disease swelling periodically. Health authorities have called on people to keep their vaccinations updated, reminding high-risk individuals to get booster shots.
Unlike other respiratory pathogens that tend to be more active during colder months, Covid’s comeback just as much of the northern hemisphere enters into summer shows the virus can still sicken a large swath of the population even when the weather is hot.

Hong Kong singer Eason Chan also came down with Covid and had to cancel his concerts in Kaohsiung, Taiwan originally scheduled for later this week, the concert’s official account on Chinese social media Weibo said Thursday.

China is on track to see a Covid wave reach last year’s summer peak, according to data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The Covid test positivity rate more than doubled among patients seeking a diagnosis at hospitals across the mainland in the five weeks through May 4.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s Department of Disease Control has reported there have been two cluster outbreaks this year, with cases rising after April’s annual Songkran festival, which brings together crowds.

Those numbers represent **a more than tripling of cases of the mosquito-borne disease recorded for all of 2024, the agency said.**

**Most cases, deaths in Brazil**

The 212 cases were confirmed from December 29, 2024, through April 26, 2025, with data for Ecuador analyzed through May 2. Brazil has the most cases and deaths—110 and 44, respectively. Colombia has 60 cases and 24 deaths, Peru 35 cases and 12 deaths, Ecuador 4 fatal cases, and Bolivia, 3 infections, including 1 fatal case.

""In 2024, human cases of yellow fever were reported mainly across the Amazon region of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Peru,"" the WHO said. ""In 2025, however, cases have been detected mainly in areas outside the Amazon region, including in the state of São Paulo, Brazil and the Tolima department, Colombia."" Last year, the Americas region had 61 confirmed yellow fever illnesses.

The five affected countries have implemented actions to respond to the outbreaks, focusing on strengthening preventive measures, improving surveillance, and implementing immunization campaigns. 

The WHO determined that the risk of yellow fever spread in the region is high. ""The occurrence of yellow fever cases outside of the Amazon basin, combined with high fatality, varying vaccination coverage across affected countries, and limited vaccine supply, contributes to the overall classification of yellow fever risk in the Region of the Americas, especially in endemic countries, as high,"" the agency said.

However, the Louisiana Department of Health say there is encouraging news about measles cases in the state.

Measles is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable respiratory virus. However, no new cases have been identified following two cases reported earlier this year.

LDH released the following statement to keep the spread of measles low:

*“The most effective way to prevent measles is through immunization. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether the MMR vaccine is right for you.”*

Though there is good news for measles cases, whooping cough cases are still on the rise.

“This is a concerning number of cases, especially because the whooping cough is an incredibly is incredibly dangerous disease for infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated,” Dr. Bruce Greenstein, Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health.

 “Our little ones are vulnerable, and they rely on the rest of us, parents, caregivers, grandparents, older siblings, neighbors, etc., to help protect them.”

**Louisiana is on track to set a record high in 2025, exceeding the previous record of 214 cases reported in 2013.**

Southwestern Ontario's public health unit is still where most of the new cases are concentrated. 

Measles cases in Alberta have reached nearly 400 since mid-March, infecting just over 120 kids under age five.

The highly contagious disease continues to primarily infect unvaccinated children, infants and teenagers, both in Ontario and Alberta.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747310567.0,Polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea confirmed by World Health Organization,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed deep concern and says neighbouring countries are at risk as it declares an outbreak of polio virus in Papua New Guinea.

Community transmission of the virus was confirmed in the city of Lae, after a screening program detected the fast-spreading virus in stool samples from two healthy children.

Poliovirus Type 2 has also been found in environmental samples in the capital Port Moresby.

WHO representative in PNG, Dr Sevil Huseynova, said the outbreak posed a serious risk to young children in PNG, where less than 50 per cent of the population immunised against the disease.

""In communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another,"" she said. [...] 

**Polio anywhere is a threat everywhere**

PNG experienced a small polio outbreak in 2018 but it was brought under control the same year and there have been no detected cases until now.

The WHO said the recently detected virus was genetically linked to strains circulating in Indonesia, which shares a land border with PNG.

Dr Huseynova said because the virus spreads rapidly, it also posed a risk to other nations.

Polio anywhere is a threat everywhere, especially to our children. Polio in Papua New Guinea can spread to neighbouring countries and anywhere in the world,"" Dr Huseynova said.

The PNG Department of Health has launched a rapid response program with assistance from the WHO, UNICEF and the Australian government.

It will focus on vaccinating people, especially children under five years of age, in target areas, along with monitoring and surveillance.

PNG Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the outbreak was likely due to low immunisation rates.

""WHO requires us to have immunisation coverage of above 80 per cent at the moment, **unfortunately our coverage is below 50 per cent and that has been a huge concern to us,"" he said.**

""Many of our parents do not take that responsibility to bring their children or babies to be immunised.""

He said no clinical cases had been detected at this stage and the two children who were exposed to the virus were vaccinated and therefore did not become infected or symptomatic.

The mass immunisation program will target around 3.5 million vaccinated and unvaccinated children between the ages of 0 and 10.

In Australia, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said the federal government was supporting PNG's response to the outbreak with ""targeted technical assistance"".

""Australia is working closely with Papua New Guinea, the World Health Organization and UNICEF to help respond to the detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""Australia is proud to be PNG's partner of choice and we will continue to work with PNG to support the health and development of its people, and to ensure a healthy region.""

UNICEF PNG country representative Veera Mendonca said she was confident the outbreak could be contained with a rapid action plan.

""If you're immunised and you have the virus, it has no effect on you … if you're immunised, no problem. This is why it is important for every child to be immunised,"" she said.

She commended the PNG government for its efforts in improving vaccine coverage in the country prior to the outbreak by ensuring stocks and cold chains in remote areas.

""In the country we have areas with only eight per cent coverage. But we also have 82 per cent coverage — so we know it is possible,"" Ms Mendonca said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747349251.0,Federal Officials May Limit Recommendations for Covid Vaccine,"Come this fall, only older Americans and those with chronic health problems may be urged to get the Covid shot — assuming the vaccine is available at all.

For years now, scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been debating whether to continue to recommend that Americans 6 months of age and older be immunized, or to switch to a so-called risk-based strategy targeting only the most vulnerable, as is the practice now in most other countries.

The advisers are expected to decide on a way forward at a meeting in June. But the debate may have become irrelevant. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines, announced earlier this month, may delay the availability of shots that had formerly been updated annually without complicated trials.

“Substantial updates to existing vaccines — such as those related to seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift — may qualify as ‘new products’ and therefore require additional clinical evaluation,” the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

That category includes the Covid shots and “may” even include the seasonal flu vaccine, according to Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for H.H.S.

The Food and Drug Administration has already asked Novavax for more clinical data before approving its Covid vaccine. (Currently it has emergency use authorization, not full approval, for people aged 12 and older.)

“We want to see vaccines that are available for high-risk individuals, and at the same time we want some good science, we want some good clinical data,” Dr. Marty Makary, who heads the agency, told reporters at a conference on Thursday.

Officials in Washington have also been asking pointed questions of C.D.C. scientists about Covid’s toll on children under 12, an indication that they may be considering an end to the use of the vaccine in that age group, according to an official who did not wish to be identified for fear of retribution

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that H.H.S. plans to stop recommending the Covid vaccine for children and pregnant women altogether, citing people familiar with the matter. [...] 

But the vaccine should remain available to some people, including adults 75 and older, who remain at high risk, Dr. Krause and other experts noted.

“In my opinion, the data from the C.D.C. provide pretty strong evidence that there are some people who are still benefiting quite a bit from the vaccines,” he said. “There are still more Covid deaths than we would like.”

Mr. Kennedy has falsely asserted that none of the vaccines routinely offered to children have been tested in placebo clinical trials, prompting sharp rebuttals from several groups of scientists, and from Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, whose vote cinched Mr. Kennedy’s nomination as health secretary earlier this year.

Some experts fear that the new federal limits are just the first steps in a campaign to undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising doubts about their safety and imposing requirements that make it untenable for companies to keep making them.

“I think that we are in the midst of watching the vaccine infrastructure being torn down bit by bit,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the F.D.A.

Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University College of Public Health who tracks the anti-vaccine movement, said there was jubilation among some groups that all vaccines, including the decades-old flu vaccine, might be challenged.

“I think everything is a target,” she said.

Covid fatalities have plummeted each year since the start of the pandemic, although there were still roughly 1,000 deaths per week during last winter’s peak. The vast majority occurred among adults aged 75 and older.

Earlier this month, federal officials sent the C.D.C. an urgent request for the annual number of Covid-related deaths in children under 12, according to an official with knowledge of the matter.

In the year ending in August, the agency reported 150 pediatric deaths, a number comparable to deaths among children in a typical flu season.

“We all, I think, support the pediatric use of flu vaccines,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. If Covid is roughly as risky to children, “I find it hard not to at least allow the vaccine to be available.”

The number of Covid deaths in children seems low only when compared with fatalities in adults, said Sean O’Leary, chair of the infectious disease committee for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“That’s the wrong way to look at it, because pediatric deaths are actually quite rare,” he said. If the vaccine were withdrawn for young children entirely, “I would have a big problem with that. Those kids do remain at higher risk for hospitalization.”

Dr. Krause said he was puzzled that the pediatric vaccine had not been moved to full approval from emergency authorization, while the adult versions were fully approved years ago by the F.D.A.

It may be that the F.D.A. has access to data that has prevented them from approving the shot, he said. “That being said, I think there probably are some children who would benefit from the vaccine,” he said.

The F.D.A. has not elaborated on what additional testing of Covid vaccines might entail. But officials may offer some clarity before the agency’s scientific advisers meet next week to discuss vaccines for the fall.

It would be unethical to offer a placebo to participants in a randomized trial if the virus still poses risks. And the results of any new trials would not be available in time for the fall, experts noted.

“In order to to create new requirements for vaccines, there would have to be evidence that that would have any benefit for the public,” said Dr. Eric Rubin, one of the F.D.A.’s advisers and editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.

“The issue, of course, is when you go into this having decided what the answer is, rather than looking at the data objectively,” he said.

Some of the C.D.C.’s advisers had mixed feelings even about moving to risk-based vaccine recommendations.

Such guidelines make sense in countries with universal health coverage, they said. But in the United States, insurance companies are not required to pay for an immunization that is not recommended by the C.D.C.

That may leave a vaccine that is too expensive for some who need it and are not explicitly included in a risk-based recommendation. A blanket recommendation may be more effective, some experts said.

“Vaccinations for children who have never been vaccinated, people with risk factors, are critically important,” said Dr. Denise Jamieson, one of the C.D.C. advisers.

It’s unclear whether the advisers retain much sway, however. Recommendations they made in April for use of several vaccines, which are typically promptly accepted by the C.D.C., have still not been endorsed by an agency leader.

The C.D.C. does not have a permanent director. Matthew Buzzelli, whom Mr. Kennedy pointed to on Wednesday as an acting director, is an attorney. Another official at H.H.S., Dr. William Archer, has sent the C.D.C. multiple questions about the advisers’ recommendations.

The outbreak cases—like those in New Mexico and Oklahoma—have been linked to the large outbreak in West Texas. Kansas's outbreak cases are in eight counties. So far, two people have been hospitalized. 

Among the 54 outbreak patients, 48 were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Of the state's overall cases, 45 patients are children. 

Officials said the most recent public exposure locations were an auto parts store in Cimarron, a library in Hutchinson, and the Wichita national airport. 

**Multiple exposures in Seattle area**

Elsewhere, health officials in Seattle-King County said yesterday they were notified about a measles case in a Canadian resident who had visited several locations in King and Snohomish County while infectious. 

Canada, like the United States, is experiencing a large outbreak, with cases reported in four provinces, mostly Ontario and Alberta. Canada's latest update listed 1,506 total measles cases, including 329 new ones.

The patient traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and visited several locations in Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett, and Woodinville while contagious. Officials added that the case isn't linked to any earlier local measles cases. Officials reported two earlier similar cases in in nonresidents who had traveled through King County, as well as five cases in Washington residents.

**Poll finds confidence mixed for Trump's measles response, high for vaccine**

In other developments, results from a new Reuters/Ipsos poll on President Donald Trump's job performance show that only 31% of respondents think the administration is handling the national measles outbreak responsibly, while 40% disagreed or did not answer the question. 

A large majority (86%) said they thought the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe for children, up a bit from 84% from a poll in 2020 in the early COVID pandemic months. However, 13% said the vaccine is unsafe for kids, up from 10% in 2020.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747263730.0,Lower fitness levels before infection linked to long COVID,"A study conducted in Dallas of 1,666 COVID-19 patients, of which 80 (5%) had long COVID, reveals that those with long COVID, on average, had lower pre‐COVID fitness. The study was published yesterday in the Journal of the American Heart Association. 

Researchers enrolled adults ages 20 to 74 years old with reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed at least twice from 2017 to 2023. CRF measures before 2020 were considered prepandemic; otherwise, self-reports of infection status or long COVID (persistent symptoms for 3 or more months) were used to determine participant status. 

All study participants completed at least two exercise treadmill tests, and CRF was estimated as final workload in metabolic equivalents. The authors also assessed total treadmill time and maximal heart rate and heart rate recovery at 1 minute.

Shortness of breath was main symptom 
At baseline, those who later developed long COVID had lower CRF—10.0 metabolic (MET) equivalents, compared with 11.1 in those who recovered, 10.7 in uninfected people, and 11.3 prepandemic. Self‐reported physical activity was lower among those with long COVID, by 880 MET‐minutes per week, compared to the other groups, as well.

Of note, the authors said unexplained shortness of breath with physical activity was similar pre‐COVID in each group (3.8% long COVID, 2.7% recovered, 3.0% uninfected, and 3.3% prepandemic), but at follow‐up was more prevalent among those with long COVID (5.0% versus 1.0% recovered, 1.1% uninfected, 2.1% prepandemic). 

Shortness of breath was the most common long-COVID symptom reported by those in the study who had symptoms for 12 or more weeks after initial infection.

""We did not find evidence for a greater decline in average CRF among people with long COVID compared with recovered, uninfected, or prepandemic participants,"" the authors concluded. ""In contrast, pre‐COVID baseline data suggest that lower measured CRF and lower levels of self‐reported physical activity before COVID may be associated with subsequent long COVID.""",1kmt77i,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/lower-fitness-levels-infection-linked-long-covid,15
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747227831.0,"Congress set to quiz RFK Jr. on budget cuts, measles response","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where the nation’s top health official is expected to be quizzed on his handling of the measles outbreak, the firing of thousands of federal health workers and major cuts to the health agencies he oversees.

Kennedy is slated to appear before a House Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday morning and will move to the Senate health committee in the afternoon. The pair of hearings marks Kennedy’s first time testifying before Congress since being sworn in as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in mid-February.

Since then, the Trump administration has moved to reshape the nation’s public health infrastructure through eliminating roughly 20,000 jobs, ousting top career officials, threatening billions of dollars in federally funded scientific research and proposing a major reorganization of the health department. Such actions have been deeply divisive, with Democrats and public health experts expressing deep concern that the changes will damage the nation’s public health infrastructure, and Kennedy and his allies countering that they are necessary to refocus the federal government on addressing chronic disease.
Kennedy plans to “share his vision on how HHS’ transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

The hearings are being billed as Kennedy’s opportunity to defend the Trump administration’s budget proposal released earlier this month, which proposed a 26 percent reduction to the department’s $127 billion budget of discretionary spending. But lawmakers typically capitalize on the moment to ask a wide range of questions, particularly demanding answers over the most controversial issues facing the nation’s sweeping health department.

That could be particularly true during a much-anticipated hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has a wide-ranging mandate and typically does not hold such budget hearings. The panel is chaired by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), a physician who openly wrestled with whether to support Kennedy’s nomination to lead HHS. Earlier this year, Cassidy implored Kennedy — the founder of a prominent anti-vaccine group — to stop invoking the debunked link between vaccines and autism. [...] 

Meanwhile, the nation is in the grip of the deadliest measles outbreak in decades, and Democrats plan to use the moment to hammer Kennedy on his response. He initially underplayed the severity of the outbreak and has promoted unproven treatments, while saying that vaccination is a personal choice. Kennedy has contended that he is simply seeking good data about vaccines and said during his confirmation hearing this year that he supports the measles vaccine.

“With respect to your views on vaccines, quite frankly, you are promoting quackery,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Connecticut), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, plans to say at the hearing, according to excerpts from her remarks. “Under your watch, our country is now failing to contain vaccine-preventable diseases.”

Some Republicans are expected to defend the cuts in funding to federal health agencies, arguing that the agencies spend massive amounts of money but their efforts have failed to close the life expectancy gap between the United States and peer nations.

“We clearly have a problem,” Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Alabama), the chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee tasked with overseeing HHS funds, plans to say in his opening statement. “Adding more and more money to the status quo simply isn’t solving the problem. It’s time to seek out bold and fresh ideas.”

Kennedy is planning to tell lawmakers that the budget provides funds to allow him to tackle issues related to nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, overreliance on medications and more.

“When a program is not as effective as it can be, or costs more than it ought to, or fails to deliver on its promise —change and reform are necessary,” according to a copy of Kennedy’s prepared remarks posted to the Appropriations Committee website.

The cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – a disease typically transmitted by camels – were reported between March 1 and April 21, 2025, according to the WHO.

Among the nine cases, a cluster of seven cases were identified in Riyadh, including six health and care workers who acquired the infection from caring for a single infected patient. Of the reported cases, five were male and four were female.

**Of the cases, only one had indirect contact with camels. The rest of the patients had no known history of contact with camels or camel products.**

The cluster was identified through contact tracing and subsequent testing of all contacts, with four of the six health and care workers being asymptomatic and two showing only mild, nonspecific signs including myalgia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.

“These cases show that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels and spilling over into the human population,” a WHO statement read Tuesday. “WHO recommends implementation of targeted infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to prevent the spread of health-care-associated infections of MERS-CoV and onward human transmission.”

The majority of cases (2,218; 84 percent), have been reported from Saudi Arabia. Since 2019, no human MERS-CoV infections have been reported from countries outside the Middle East.

The global health body also said that it has been monitoring the epidemiological situation related to MERS-CoV and conducting risk assessments based on the latest information.

Followed in 2022 by A Cryptic Report of A 2nd H10N3 Case from Hong Kong's CHP.

In April of 2023 a 3rd case was reported from Yunnan Province (see Nature Portfolio preprint)

And in January of 2025, 1 New H10N3 Case
 was reported from Guangxi)

Today's case is once again from Guangxi. 

Last July, in Frontiers: Phylogenetic and Mutational Analysis of H10N3 Avian Influenza A virus in China: Potential Threats to Human Health, we looked at a report that described 4 mutations of concern in the 2023 case (HA Q226L, PB2 D701N, PA S409N, and M2 S31N), along with the patient's treatment and course of illness.

>Last December Vet. Microbiology: The novel H10N3 Avian Influenza Virus Acquired Airborne Transmission Among Chickens: An Increasing Threat to Public Health reported the virus has become better adapted to poultry, is highly pathogenic in mice, can be transmitted via respiratory droplets between guinea pigs, and can also be transmitted via the airborne route by chickens.

They also reported on a serology study of poultry workers, which found a small but significant (1.5%) positivity rate. We've also seen other H10 viruses spillover to humans in China, including H10N8 and H10N5.  So far, we've seen no evidence of human-to-humans transmission. 

Today's HK CHP report also lists 8 new H9N2 cases, 7 of which are children.  Most H9N2 infections are mild, although several deaths have been reported. Details on the severity of illness of these cases is not provided, although no deaths are indicated.

Seroprevalence studies suggest that H9N2 is underreported around the globe (see FluTracker's list), but over the past five years we've seen a surge of cases reported from China (see ECDC Chart below), likely due to increased surveillance for COVID.

H9N2 is poorly controlled in Chinese poultry, despite the use of vaccines (see J. Virus Erad.: Ineffective Control Of LPAI H9N2 By Inactivated Poultry Vaccines - China), which has led to the creation and spread of numerous of genotypes.

>H9N2 also reassorts with, and often enhances, other novel influenza viruses (including H7N9, H5N1, and H5N6), making it an important viral co-conspirator (see Vet. Sci.: The Multifaceted Zoonotic Risk of H9N2 Avian Influenza).

H9N2 is such a versatile virus, it has even been detected in Egyptian Fruit bats (see Preprint: The Bat-borne Influenza A Virus H9N2 Exhibits a Set of Unexpected Pre-pandemic Features).  Six weeks ago, in Cell: Early-warning Signals and the Role of H9N2 in the Spillover of Avian Influenza Viruses, we took a deep dive into the evolving threat from H9N2. 

>While LPAI H9N2 is admittedly not at the very top of our list of pandemic concerns, the CDC has 2 different lineages (A(H9N2) G1 and A(H9N2) Y280) on their short list of influenza viruses with zoonotic potential (see CDC IRAT SCORE), and several candidate vaccines have been developed.

Which is why continued reports of cases in China (and elsewhere) are worthy of our attention.

In somewhat related news, colds and allergies are up. Tomatoes were recalled, a listeria outbreak is causing hospitalizations, and the president’s pick for Surgeon General is generally unqualified. There is also some good public health news in New York, and some things I’m noticing under the radar.

Here’s your dose of health information to feel equipped for the week.

**Common colds and allergies are peaking**

Feeling sick? You’re not alone. Lab-confirmed cases of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses—better known as the common cold—are high across the U.S. This is normal for this time of year, with a typical peak in mid-May before easing up for the summer.

Tree pollen is also surging, triggering a lot of allergy symptoms. Grasses will soon take over. This spring is another record-breaker for seasonal allergies, with more (and larger) particles in the air due to rising carbon dioxide levels and a warming climate.

What does this mean for you? Unfortunately, there’s no cure for the common cold, but here are a few YLE-backed immune system tips. As for allergies, here are at-home tips that can help.

Note: Allergies can weaken your immune system and make you more vulnerable to viruses like the cold. On the flip side, colds can make you more reactive to allergens. It’s a vicious cycle.

**Measles**

The U.S. has surpassed 1,000 confirmed measles cases—1,014 as of Saturday. While this is slightly behind Mexico (1,065) and Canada (1,867) case counts, it’s a troubling trend as we edge closer to breaking a 25-year record.

The North Dakota and Arkansas outbreaks (11 cases and 6 cases) and subsets of the Texas outbreak (the El Paso cluster is medium with 53 cases) are still small but continue to grow. We also had sporadic cases in California and New York the past week. **Note: Florida stopped publicly sharing infectious disease alerts; it’s unclear why.**

Growth in other places, like West Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, continues to slow down. This is due to a combination of two things:

In some places, the virus is running out of people to infect.

Local public health teams are actively tracing, isolating, quarantining, and vaccinating.

What does this mean for you? You’re well protected if you’re up to date on your MMR vaccine. However, if you live near an outbreak and have an infant under 12 months, talk to your pediatrician—MMR can be given as early as 6 months in some cases. Slowing spread is welcome news for those most at risk, including immunocompromised individuals, infants under 1, and others who are unvaccinated.

**Food Safety Alerts**

*At least 10 people are sick from a Listeria outbreak in 4 states*

Fresh and Ready Foods has recalled several ready-to-eat sandwiches and snack items sold in California, Washington, Nevada, and Arizona—including in healthcare facilities—due to a Listeria outbreak. So far, at least 10 people have been hospitalized. Those most at risk include pregnant women, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

The recalled products have “use by” dates between April 22 and May 19, 2025, and were sold under the brand names Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go, and Fresh Take Crave Away.

*Potential Salmonella vine-ripe tomatoes recalled in 11 states*

Ray & Mascari Inc. has issued a recall of 4-count vine-ripe tomatoes sold at Gordon Food Service Stores across 11 states. This is precautionary, as no illnesses have been reported so far, but salmonella was detected after routine testing.

If you bought these and live in one of the affected states (see map above), it’s best to toss them out.

Last week, New York joined eight other states in passing universal school meals for children. (Many other states are planning, drafting, or discussing.) This is a public health victory, propelled by a silver lining of the pandemic, which increased awareness of the importance of school meals for children.

[...] 

A lot is happening between the lines in the health policy world that isn’t necessarily getting picked up, so I figured I would call out a few that are unfolding:

1. Vaccine policy is stalling in an unusual way.

(Concern meter: Moderate)

At the most recent ACIP meeting, CDC’s external vaccine advisory committee voted to expand RSV vaccine eligibility to adults aged 50 and older. Normally, this recommendation would be approved by the CDC Director within 48 hours. But since we currently don’t have a confirmed director (Dr. Monarez awaits Senate approval), the decision fell to the Chief of Staff. That was weeks ago—and still, no sign-off.

Word is RFK Jr. has empowered his inner circle to privately access and review the science before making a decision, effectively bypassing the expert advisory process altogether. This delay and lack of transparency undermine the administration’s own stated commitment to transparent decision-making.

2. The Surgeon General nominee is… a wellness influencer.

(Concern meter: Low. Doing wonders for my impostor syndrome.)

Casey Means, a physician-turned-influencer and founder of a wellness tech company, has been nominated for Surgeon General. While the role doesn’t drive policy, per se, it does come with a huge megaphone—it’s “America’s Doctor,” after all. Past Surgeon Generals have shaped public understanding of cigarettes, alcohol, and loneliness.

While she rightly highlights important issues like nutrition, the solutions she promotes often lead Americans down the wrong path. For example, her company profits from selling continuous glucose monitors to the general public—despite strong evidence that these devices are only truly useful for people with diabetes who take insulin. (Note: The wellness industry is lucrative; worth more than $6 trillion.) She’s also questioned the number of childhood vaccines, advocated drinking raw milk during an H5N1 outbreak, and suggested unsafe practices like making Ozempic at home. 

But beyond these specific claims, what’s more troubling is what she represents: a growing trend of capitalizing on the failures of U.S. food and health policy by turning health into a consumer lifestyle brand. A movement often divorced from medical training, public health, and systemic reality—fueled by mistrust and the vacuum left by institutions slow to respond or evolve.

Interestingly, the political response has been chaotic. MAGA influencers inside the White House, like Laura Loomer, are angry that Means is even being considered. Some in the MAHA movement think she’s too supportive of vaccines.

I originally assumed her nomination would sail through. Now, I’m not so sure. Regardless, a wellness influencer getting a Surgeon General nomination is doing wonders for my imposter syndrome.

3. Eyes are on the RFK testimony

RFK Jr.’s upcoming testimony on May 12 is mainly triggered by the Executive Budget released a few weeks ago. But I expect (and hope) he’ll be asked about far more than budget line items. The public deserves answers on several fronts: how proposed cuts will actually impact community’s health, his role—or lack thereof—in responding to the measles outbreak, lack of transparency, and more. Here’s what you can do if you’re concerned about health cuts.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747095394.0,Data suggest COVID-19 reinfections less likely to cause long COVID,"A new preprint study on the preprint server medRxiv involving healthcare workers in Quebec shows that the risk of long COVID following any initial COVID-19 infection was similar among participants, cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with a much lower risk of long COVID than a person's first infection.

The study is based on 22,496 online survey participants and 3,978 telephone survey participants who took part in a retrospective cohort study from May 16 to June 15, 2023. It has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Participants, all healthcare workers, were asked to assess self-reported COVID-19–attributed symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity.  Results were compared with COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and with non-COVID controls (uninfected participants).

Among all online respondents, 17.0% said they had experienced persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infections, similar to the 15.9% of telephone respondents. Forty-three percent of respondents with long COVID said their case was moderate, and 33% classified their long COVID as severe.

The most common symptoms among those with long COVID were fatigue, shortness of breath, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise, and smell or taste disturbances.

**Risk 15% after first infection, 6% after second**

The cumulative risk of long COVID increased with the number of reported COVID-19 infections, rising from 13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.1% to 14.4%) for a single infection to 37.0% (95% CI, 33.0% to 40.9%) for three infections in the online survey, and from 11.8% (a single infection) to 29.5% (≥3 infections) in the telephone survey, according to the authors.

With both surveys combined, the risk of long COVID was two to three times higher after the initial infection (14.8%) than after first (5.8%) or second (5.3%) reinfections.

""Severe symptoms were reported 5 to 22 times more often by long COVID cases than by COVID controls, except for fever, cough, insomnia, anxiety, and depression (2.7 to 4.5 times),"" the authors wrote. 

Risk for long COVID was highest following infections with the ancestral strain and lowest after Omicron infections. However, because Omicron caused such widespread transmission, that strain was associated with the most long-COVID cases.

""Our study indicates that long COVID risk is roughly two thirds lower following reinfection compared to first infection,"" the authors said. ""This may be partly related to greater host-specific resistance among individuals who did not have long COVID following their first episode.""",1kl8c02,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/data-suggest-covid-19-reinfections-less-likely-cause-long-covid,20
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1747085653.0,"FDA, CDC recommend pause in Valneva chikungunya vaccine for older adults","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on May 9 recommended a pause in the use of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine (Ixchiq) in people ages 60 and older while officials investigate severe adverse events, some neurologic and cardiac, in vaccine recipients. 

Globally, 17 severe adverse events, 2 of them fatal, have been reported in people ages 62 to 89 years who received the vaccine. Six were from the United States. The FDA said it will conduct an updated risk-benefit assessment.

The FDA approved the vaccine in November 2023 for use in people ages 18 and older at increased risk for the mosquito-borne disease. At its meeting in April, CDC vaccine advisors recommended including a precaution about the vaccine’s use in people ages 65 and older. The FDA and CDC said about 80,000 doses have been given globally.

Ixchiq contains a weakened form of the virus, which may cause symptoms of chikungunya. Federal officials said some of the severe adverse events reported are similar to severe complications from the disease.

In a statement today, Valneva supported precautionary measures that groups have announced. It added that most of the reports involved those who had underlying health conditions or were taking other medications. It said a thorough investigation is critical for sorting whether the adverse events are related to use of the vaccine.

**Pause follows earlier alert, regulator actions in Europe**

The recommended pause for use in people ages 60 and older follows a CDC alert in early March that said it was investigating five hospitalizations in people ages 65 and older who had received the vaccine. 

In late April, French drug regulators updated their recommendations for Ixchiq after reports of adverse reactions in older people with underlying health conditions who were prioritized the receive the vaccine in a large ongoing outbreak in La Reunion and Mayotte. On May 7, the European Medicines Agency announced that its safety committee had launched a review of Ixchiq in older people and said the vaccine must not be used in people ages 65 and older.

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1747015373.0,New measles case in Auckland New Zealand linked to overseas travel with exposure on ferries and at supermarket,"Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora has confirmed today that a new case of measles has been identified in Auckland, linked to overseas travel. National Public Health Service (NPHS) is supporting the person with measles and their household. Those who are non-immune are now in quarantine to help reduce the chance of spread of this highly contagious disease.

The person with measles has travelled recently to Asia where they are thought to have caught the virus but was not infectious while flying home. There are a number of public locations in Auckland where the person has been while infectious. Measles is a serious and highly infectious illness so people should check their immunisation status and follow public health advice.

The NPHS is asking people who were at these locations during the times to check their immunisation status. You are considered immune to measles if you have proof of two doses of the MMR vaccine. People born before 1969 or have evidence of having measles previously are also considered immune. 

Check your immunisation status 

People can check their immunisation records by logging onto My Health Record via www.my.health.nz (external link) or by contacting their local healthcare provider. My Health Record is a secure website where most New Zealanders can view their immunisation records, from the year 2005 onwards. In the event of any difficulties, or for records prior to 2005, people should contact their local healthcare provider. The Vaccination Helpline on 0800 28 29 26 can also check vaccinations for children and young people during business hours (8.30am-5pm, Monday-Friday). 

Not immune?  

Anyone exposed at these places and who is not immune should ring Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice as they are considered close contacts. If you are not immune, please stay at home until you have contacted Healthline. 

Healthline offers a convenient callback option. This service allows you to leave your phone number, hold your place in line, and receive a call when it's your turn. 

The locations of interest are on the  info.health.nz (external link) website. This will be updated with new locations as part of the NPHS case investigation.  

Watch for measles symptoms 

Anyone exposed at these times should also watch for symptoms of measles and if they develop any, they should contact Healthline immediately on 0800 611 116 and stay home until they receive advice from public health services.

Measles symptoms to be aware of: 

the illness begins with high fever (over 38 C), cough, runny nose, and sore red eyes (conjunctivitis) 
a rash, beginning on the face and gradually spreading down the body to the arms and legs. The rash lasts for up to one week. 
“Measles is a serious and highly infectious illness, which can affect adults as well as children and babies,” says Health NZ NPHS, Protection Clinical Director Dr Susan Jack. “The MMR vaccine is the only thing that prevents measles.” 

If a person with suspected measles infection needs to seek healthcare from a doctor or healthcare provider, they should phone ahead and tell the clinic that they may have been exposed to measles.

“Now is an important time to remind everyone to check if you and your whānau are immune to measles. You are considered immune if you have had two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine after the age of 12 months. People born or living in New Zealand before 1969 or have had measles previously (confirmed by blood results) are also considered immune. 

If you are unsure of how many doses of the MMR vaccine you have had before, for most people it’s safe to get immunised again,” says Dr Jack. 

The MMR vaccine is free in New Zealand for anyone 18 years or under, and for people who are eligible for free healthcare.  

“Being immunised not only protects you, but also those around you from becoming seriously ill and from spreading the disease to others, including friends, loved ones and people in your community,” says Dr Jack.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746970776.0,"Florida whooping cough cases nearly double from this time last year, CDC says","Whooping cough, or pertussis, is on the rise again in the United States, and the number of cases in 2025 are nearly double what they were for this same period last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC released numbers for pertussis cases up until April 26. There have been 9,034 cases reported in 2025 compared to 4,698 by this date in 2024.

The CDC says that whooping cough is a very contagious respiratory illness that unlike a common cold can cause coughing for weeks or months.

The data shows that the state of Florida, where 468 cases have been reported, is also seeing this trend, with 27 just this week. At this same time last year, only 96 cases had been reported.

In 2024, a total of 708 cases were recorded in the state, according to the Florida Department of Health.

The numbers for this year ""are trending towards levels reported pre-pandemic in 2019,"" the Department of Health said. ""Mitigation efforts used during the pandemic likely lowered transmission of pertussis.""

In early April, a Weston elementary school warned parents that one case of whooping cough had been confirmed there. The health department then held a free voluntary vaccination event at the school.

The best way to prevent whooping cough is to get vaccinated, the CDC says.

NBC News reported that whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again. 

A 2024 CDC report found that the percentage of U.S. kindergartners during the previous school year who had been vaccinated against both measles and whooping cough dipped to less than 93%. In 2019, the national coverage rate was 95%.

What's more, the pertussis vaccine doesn’t work as well as it used to. In the 1990s, manufacturers altered the way the vaccine was made to reduce its side effects, like fevers and vomiting. As a result, the shot’s effectiveness isn’t as robust. Boosters are needed every 10 years.

And research published by the CDC in 2019 suggested that the bacteria behind the disease had mutated. In 2024, the Food and Drug Administration met to discuss the need for more robust and longer-lasting versions of the whooping cough vaccine.",1kk194e,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/florida-whooping-cough-cases-nearly-double-from-this-time-last-year-cdc-says/3610212/,231
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746909106.0,Mosquito-borne viral disease sweeping Indian Ocean islands,"Twenty years ago, when the painful viral disease chikungunya exploded on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion and sickened hundreds of thousands, doctors longed for a vaccine. Now the virus is surging again, causing 50,000 confirmed cases and 12 deaths on the island, a French department, and spreading on neighboring islands including Mauritius. This time a vaccine called Ixchiq is readily available. But safety problems have cropped up, and on Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspended the vaccine’s use in people 65 years and older after two deaths and several serious adverse events. 

The outbreak on Réunion may be showing signs of ebbing. But need for the vaccine may not, as the virus is expected to spread beyond the Indian Ocean, imported with travelers returning from that region. Tulio de Oliveira, director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI) at Stellenbosch University, notes, “There’s a special concern when summer is starting in Europe and there is higher susceptibility for chikungunya transmission.” [...]

The disease exploded on Réunion in 2005–06 after the virus acquired a mutation in its envelope gene that is thought to make it more readily transmitted by A. albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, which predominates on Réunion. The virus causing the new outbreak “evolved a bit [since 2005–06], but the circulating lineage now still carries [that mutation],” Muriel Vincent, an epidemiologist on Réunion with Public Health France, said at a World Health Organization (WHO) webinar on 7 May. “We assume that’s why we saw such an explosive circulation.”

Houriiyah Tegally, a bioinformatician who is head of data science at CERI, believes there is another factor. “It’s been a really long time now, 20 years” since the last big outbreak, enough time for an entire generation of young people to be born without immunity to the virus, says Tegally, who with colleagues is studying the genetics of the virus on Réunion and Mauritius and supporting the outbreak response. In addition, she says, French people and other Europeans often retire to Réunion, providing an additional population of immunologically naïve people.

The new vaccine promised to help stem the spread. Made of a live, weakened version of the virus, Ixchiq was approved last year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for those ages 18 and older in the United States and by other regulators for use in this age group in the European Union, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Last month, it was approved for those ages 12 to 17 in the EU.

But earlier hints of safety problems had led a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee to recommend on 16 April that the vaccine be used with caution in people 65 years and older. 

The problems became clearer in recent weeks as Réunion launched an emergency vaccination campaign against chikungunya with a priority, according to a Valneva press release, on older, more at risk adults. But now, because of the adverse events, including two deaths, “Ixchiq must not be used in adults aged 65 years and above” or in people with weakened immune systems, EMA wrote, saying the halt is a temporary measure while it conducts an in-depth review. 

The recommendation followed a similar one made by the French vaccine regulatory agency on 25 April, which stopped the administration of vaccines to those in that age group on Réunion. And hours after this article was published, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended pausing the use of the Ixchiq vaccine in people 60 years and older while the agencies investigate the serious adverse events.""

The adverse events in the elderly are “pretty big news [but] not so surprising,” says David Hamer, an infectious disease physician at Boston University who is surveillance lead for GeoSentinel, an infectious disease surveillance network. Hamer notes that similar problems have emerged with the yellow fever vaccine, which also consists of a weakened virus that can sometimes cause problematic infection in recipients. In people with weak immune systems because of age or immunosuppression for other reasons, Ixchiq “may not be a safe vaccine,” he says.

In a press release on 7 May, Valneva asserted that all of those affected by adverse events had “significant underlying medical conditions and/or co-medications.” EMA noted that the two deaths, both on Réunion, occurred in an 84-year-old man who developed brain inflammation and a 77-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease.

But the vaccine’s limitations worry public health experts. “The age range for which it’s approved and the safety concerns are limiting the ability to use the vaccine in people at highest risk of severe disease,” says Philip Krause, a physician and former vaccine regulator with FDA who participated in a recent WHO consultation on chikungunya vaccines. Very young children, for whom it is not approved, along with the elderly, are most vulnerable to the disease. For instance, of 70 patients hospitalized with severe disease on Réunion, 23 were infants less than 6 months of age. [...] 

With the arrival of cooler weather in the Southern Hemisphere, the number of cases on Réunion may be on the decline, Vincent said during the Wednesday webinar. The average of 20,000 weekly cases reported by family medicine clinics (though not necessarily confirmed with genetic testing) in recent weeks fell to 14,000 in the week that ended on 4 May, she said. Since the epidemic was declared in January, there have been about 174,000 such cases.

Hamer says a tailing off wouldn’t be surprising. “The natural history of these outbreaks, especially on an island is they blast through in a very short period of time and fade away.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746877830.0,How Colombia is responding to a deadly Yellow Fever outbreak,"Bogotá, Colombia — Colombian authorities are trying to contain a Yellow Fever Outbreak following President Gustavo Petro’s declaration of a health emergency on April 15.

The Pan American Health Organization recorded twice as many cases in the Americas in the first three months of 2025 compared to all of 2024, noting a “particularly concerning” situation in Tolima, Colombia.

Since September 2024, Colombia has recorded 85 cases and 38 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health, representing a 44% mortality rate. In comparison, 2023 saw only two cases in the country while none were recorded between 2019 and 2022.

In the same period since the outbreak began, 78% of confirmed Yellow Fever cases have been in Tolima, which has registered 67 incidents of infection and 25 deaths.

Speaking to Latin America Reports, Tolima’s Health Secretary, Katheirne Rengifo, explained the department’s response plan which follows multiple “strategic lines.” The first of these entails a mass vaccination campaign.

“The first challenge was to reach the rural area where the first case occurred,” said Rengifo.

She explained that the region’s remoteness meant that health authorities had to travel with basic equipment up to eight hours to vaccinate local farmers.

The vaccine rollout in Tolima was part of a nationwide program under Petro’s health emergency. 

According to the president, some 540,000 people received vaccines across the country’s 32 departments, with the majority in Tolima. Petro also said that the country had 3.7 million vaccines available for the disease.

In addition to inoculation, the department’s outbreak response has sought to improve its treatment of patients with the disease. While Yellow Fever is technically untreatable, mortality can be reduced through methods to reduce dehydration and fever. 

Rengifo notes that since the beginning of the outbreak, the disease’s mortality rate in Colombia has dropped from 47% to 37%. She cited the role of new government guidelines issued by the national Ministry of Health and Social Protection two weeks ago.

The Health Secretary also stressed the importance of communications campaigns that seek to raise awareness about the dangers of the disease. 

“We have to ensure that we deliver the message in a timely manner, not with the purpose of generating fear, but to protect and warn the population,” said Rengifo.

The department has sought to raise awareness about the importance of vaccinations and reducing exposure to mosquitoes. It has also worked with religious leaders to stress that the best form of protection is vaccination.

While this outbreak is not unusual in of itself, given the cyclical nature of the disease, its geographical spread makes it notable.

There have been cases recorded in areas previously unaffected by Yellow Fever, which Petro has blamed on climate change. 

In a statement on April 21, the president highlighted invisible threats brought by changing environmental patterns.

“Something you cannot see, but that advances and advances quickly, is the number of viruses that, due to changing climatic conditions, are beginning to come into contact with human beings where they were not previously,” said Petro. 

Changing climate patterns including higher temperatures and increased rainfall can increase the habitat range of mosquitoes that transmit Yellow Fever, according to Colombia’s Ministry of Health. 

In response to the outbreak, the government has increased travel warnings within the country.

The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) also elevated its travel warning level for Colombia, encouraging U.S. tourists to “practice enhanced precautions.”",1kj8foc,https://latinamericareports.com/how-colombia-is-responding-to-a-deadly-yellow-fever-outbreak/11455/,14

The steady rise in cases is fueled by multiple outbreaks, with two more reported this week. The CDC is tracking 14 outbreaks that are responsible for 93% of cases. 

**More infections in Texas, Arkansas**

The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 7 more cases since its last update on May 6, lifting the state's total to 709 confirmed patients, of whom 679 (96%) were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.

Five more hospitalizations were reported, putting that total at 92. The number of deaths remained at two.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746791126.0,"With measles outbreaks growing in Canada, this mother pleads with parents to vaccinate","Rebecca Archer lovingly places a pair of small glasses on a shelf filled with memorabilia like trinkets and photos. They belonged to her 10-year-old daughter, Renae, who suddenly died after a measles infection.

""She was just really intelligent. Just a really happy child, always smiling,"" she remembers.

Renae was just five months old when she got the measles – too young to be vaccinated, but unable to avoid being exposed during an outbreak in Manchester, England, in 2013.

The infant was hospitalized, but recovered. For the next 10 years, Renae had no other medical issues, her mom says. 

But the measles virus was sitting dormant in her brain for years. When it woke up, Renae started having seizures. Then, she couldn't speak, or eat, or even stay conscious. 

""The fact that it was measles, I just couldn't get my head around it,"" Archer said. 

With measles cases on the rise in Canada at rates unseen in almost three decades — and vaccination coverage for childhood vaccines like the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot falling since the pandemic  — Archer and others who have suffered from measles complications are pleading that those who can get vaccinated do. 

**You never think it's going to happen to you**

**When Renae's seizures began, she was suffering from a rare complication of measles called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE.** Out of 100,000 measles cases, it happens to less than a dozen people. 

**But for kids like Renae who get measles before they're 15 months old, the risk level rises significantly – to one in 609.**

It is almost always fatal, and there's little doctors can do to help — a hard truth for Archer to accept.

""I always had it in my mind, once we found out what was actually wrong, Renae, we'll get her back to herself again,"" she said.

Instead, doctors told Archer her first-born daughter had no brain activity. There was nothing to do – except decide when to turn off her life-support machines.

The mother says she didn't imagine measles could do this much damage. Now, her grief is tinged with rage: she says that Renae would still be alive if others were immunized against measles.

""You never think it's going to happen to you,"" she said.

""It does make me really angry, and make me want to help people understand how serious it is.""

**Fears of a death this year in Canada**

Dr. Michelle Barton has seen a case of SSPE once in her career – not in Canada, but in a developing country.

""It's a sad picture to watch, because there is really not much you can do.""

It's not a complication physicians would normally consider in countries like Canada, where measles was declared eliminated in 1998, said Barton, who heads the pediatric infectious diseases division at the Children's Hospital in London, Ont. 

With the virus continuing to spread in Canada, with cases in every province, Barton fears physicians may need to start thinking about measles complications like SSPE more frequently. 

""In this outbreak, there have been no deaths. And we are grateful for that,"" said Barton, who has been seeing some of the sickest patients in the province — and doing everything possible to prevent a death.

Alberta has been seeing a sharp increase in the past few weeks — on Thursday, the province reported 313 cases since the outbreaks began in March.

Saskatchewan, too, is seeing a rapid increase in cases. Cases there have more than doubled in the past week, and the province's top doctor says he's expecting daily increases for the next weeks, or even months. 

But the heart of the spread continues to be Ontario, which is reporting 1,453 cases so far this year, the vast majority in those not fully vaccinated against the highly-contagious virus.

Dr. Upton Allen, the head of the division of infectious diseases at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) says those numbers are troubling. 

For children with a healthy immune system, he says, there is a risk of complications like pneumonia, or a bad ear infection, in about one in every 10 cases. Measles can also cause encephalitis – inflammation of the brain at a rate of one per 1,000, he said. 

The risk level is much higher for those whose immune systems are compromised, Allen said. 

""They need to be protected,"" he said, ""we protect them by vaccinating those around them.""

**Lifelong complications**

Those who do survive measles, may be left with lifelong complications —  like 73-year old Barbara Leonhard, who lives in Columbia, Mo. 

It was the late 1950s, before a measles vaccine was available. Leonhard, who was six at the time, remembers her legs giving out, losing the ability to speak, before everything went black. The measles virus had caused her brain to swell, and she fell into a 30-day coma. 

When she woke up, she was told she would never walk again.

""It felt like I was condemned, like a sentence was passed,"" she remembers.

Leonhard says she didn't accept that. She spent months, pulling herself out of the wheelchair, dragging her feet in the living room, teaching herself to walk again. She was successful — but she remains deeply scarred.

""It was traumatic and scary,"" she said. Today, she struggles with muscle weakness — something her neurologist attributes as a lasting effect of her encephalitis, all those years ago. 

She's pleading with parents to vaccinate their kids against measles, if they haven't done so already.

""You have to think about the life of your child, what you're risking.""

Rebecca Archer, still grieving her daughter, hopes by sharing her family's story, more people will decide to get vaccinated: enough to reach herd immunity — 95 per cent — which she says could have saved her daughter.

Archer says she's sharing her story, with the hope others will understand the stakes — so no other parent would have to go through what she did. ",1kigg7l,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-complications-1.7530506,381
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746790488.0,"RSV sent fewer babies to the hospital last winter, after new treatment and vaccine arrived","A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows there was a substantial drop in hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus this winter among very young children, who are at the highest risk of becoming severely ill if they contract RSV.

This past winter was the first during which new options for protecting babies from the virus became widely available in the United States, though the products were first introduced in a limited way in advance of the 2023-2024 season. 

The study, published in the CDC’s online journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, cannot prove that the new tools are the reason for the drop in hospitalizations among children under 7 months old, the age group targeted for these interventions. But a rise in hospitalizations among slightly older children — still at risk but too old to be eligible for the products — shows the decline occurred in the context of a severe RSV season.

RSV is the No. 1 cause of hospitalizations of infants, with seriously ill babies struggling to breathe. 
The new tools are a vaccine, made by Pfizer, that is offered to pregnant people in their third trimester if they are due to deliver between September and January, and an injection of monoclonal antibodies, made by Sanofi and AstraZeneca, which should be given at or near birth to babies whose mothers were not vaccinated, or near the start of the RSV season for babies who were born in the spring or summer. Infants should benefit from one or the other, but do not need both.

The vaccine, sold as Abrysvo, generates antibodies that are passed to the baby in the womb, giving protection during the first months of life. The antibody injection, sold under the name Beyfortus, is also given to some children entering their second RSV season, if they are considered at high risk of serious illness if they contract RSV. 

“Although we need to do more, we know now that we can dramatically lower hospitalization rates due to severe RSV disease in young infants using our new tools — monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization,” said one of the authors, Janet Englund, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington.

These products are believed to have the potential to dramatically reduce the toll RSV takes on infants, their families, and health care systems that can become overwhelmed during RSV season. 
A number of publications from Europe, where the products were introduced earlier, have shown substantial reductions in severe RSV disease, especially in places where a high percentage of infants are protected. 

In this study, scientists from the CDC and a number of academic institutions looked at data from two different surveillance networks, comparing hospitalizations this past winter to those that occurred during the two RSV seasons that preceded the Covid-19 pandemic, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020. 
They saw a decline of between 45% and 52% in RSV hospitalizations of infants ages 0 to 2 months, when compared to the earlier years. When data from Houston were removed from one of the datasets, the decline in this age group was actually 71%. The RSV season in Houston began in September, before the product rollouts began.

“The goal of the study was to …  see if these products made a difference — they did,” said Natasha Halasa, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, and a co-author of the paper. “The findings from this study indicates that we are on the right path in reducing the risk of RSV hospitalizations in infants.”

When data for all children ages 0 to 7 months were included, the reduction was between 28% and 43%.  
The researchers did not know what percentage of the babies in these two cohorts had been protected, either by receiving the monoclonal injection or because they received vaccine-induced antibodies in the womb, so they could not calculate how effective the products were in protecting the individual children.

Rollout of these products has been challenging, especially the antibody injection. Though it is covered by insurance and by the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program, it is expensive for birthing hospitals and pediatricians to stock, creating a situation where some might opt to let the other provide this service.
Halasa said more work is ongoing to identify the barriers to getting all babies protected, either via maternal vaccination or an antibody injection. “The goal is: Let’s get this in every baby we can,” she said in an interview.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746708590.0,‘I felt like I was on fire’: Sask. woman recovering from serious case of measles,"A Saskatchewan woman who contracted measles last month wants more people to get vaccinated against the disease to prevent others from getting sick.

Michelle Knorr, 55, was hospitalized late last week after fighting a high fever, body shakes, dehydration, vomiting and diarrhea for several days.

“I just kept on thinking it was the worst flu bug I had ever had in my life,” she told CTV News from her home in Kindersley.

“Once the rash hit, I knew it was a problem.”

A bright red rash extended from Knorr’s scalp all the way to the tips of her toes. It radiated heat, she said, and caused the pores in her face to stretch from the swelling.

“I felt like I was on fire,” she said.

The blotchy rash is a telltale sign of measles, which often appears a few days after the initial symptoms.

Knorr was taken by ambulance from Kindersley to a hospital in Saskatoon. She had to be treated for sepsis, high blood pressure, jaundice and liver damage that led to hepatitis.

“If I would have been a less healthier person, I might not be here today. I was in very critical condition,” she said.

The latest data from the Government of Canada shows there were 1,117 confirmed measles cases in the country as of April 19. Ontario has recorded the most with 993 cases, followed by Alberta with 120.

Knorr joins at least 12 others who have tested positive for measles in Saskatchewan this year – the highest amount of people to contract the disease in the province since 2014 when 16 patients got sick with it.

The substitute teacher believes she contracted the disease from one of the schools where she works.

“It’s beyond frustrating because as teachers, we’re given a lot to deal with but the least of which we should have to be worrying about is a 19th century disease,” she said.

Knorr falls under the age group that received a single dose of measles vaccine before a second one was made routine.

“That second dose of measles vaccination was added in 1996 in most parts of Canada,” said infectious diseases physician Dr. Isaac Bogoch.

“There were catch-up campaigns, but they were far from perfect, and there are people walking around who have had a single dose of a vaccine. 

Canadians born before 1970 are presumed to have acquired natural immunity to measles, according to the federal government’s website.

“This is largely an infection in people who are born after 1970, and usually in younger cohorts who are not immune,” Bogoch said.

Knorr counts herself lucky. She is back at home and on her way to recovery. Her rash has faded but she’s still tired and dealing with lingering symptoms.

She wants to remind others that her situation was preventable through vaccines.

“This didn’t have to happen. It did not have to be like this for me,” she said.

“There’s no way a measles virus should be running rampant.” [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746707004.0,Scientists Hail This Medical Breakthrough. A Political Storm Could Cripple It.,"To scientists who study it, mRNA is a miracle molecule. The vaccines that harnessed it against Covid saved an estimated 20 million lives, a rapid development that was recognized with a Nobel Prize. Clinical trials show mRNA-based vaccines increasing survival in patients with pancreatic and other deadly cancers. Biotechnology companies are investing in the promise of mRNA therapies to treat and even cure a host of genetic and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

But to some state legislators, mRNA therapies are “weapons of mass destruction” and a public health threat. They argue that these vaccines are untested and unsafe, and will be pumped into the food supply to “mass medicate” Americans against their will. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official, has inaccurately called the mRNA shots against Covid “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”

Short for messenger RNA, mRNA exists naturally in every cell of every living organism — its discovery in 1961 was also celebrated with a Nobel Prize. But its association with Covid has thrust it to the center of a political storm, buffeted by vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, anger over lockdowns and mandates, and the ascendance of the Make America Healthy Again movement in the Trump administration.

States and federal health agencies are playing on public wariness about vaccines to cancel research into mRNA more broadly, indicating how much the lingering politicization of Covid is fueling the new attacks on science.

The National Institutes of Health, which historically has funded the research behind almost every drug on the market, this month announced that it would shift money that had been spent studying mRNA vaccines to pay for a $500 million grant to study a universal vaccine using traditional, non-mRNA technology. Jay Bhattacharya, a leading critic of the Covid response and the new director of the N.I.H., called it a “paradigm shift.”

The N.I.H. had already canceled or paused many grants studying mRNA vaccines, and asked for an accounting of all other research it funds on mRNA, which scientists fear is a step toward terminating federal funding — especially as the N.I.H. has slowed grants and President Trump has proposed cutting its budget by $18 billion.

Dozens of bills in legislatures from Montana to New York would regulate or ban products that contain mRNA, beyond Covid shots and including products that are not on any market.

Scientists and biotech leaders say the demonization of mRNA will cut short research into promising treatments and cures, and send it to other countries where health authorities and investors are rolling out a welcome mat.

“The consequences are enormous,” said Drew Weissman, director of the Institute for RNA Innovation at the University of Pennsylvania and a 2023 Nobel laureate in medicine for the discoveries that enabled the mRNA Covid vaccines. “It has so much potential for other therapies.”

Dr. Weissman saw one of his federal grants canceled, and said hundreds of others that study vaccine hesitancy have been terminated, including a half-dozen at Penn, because they mentioned mRNA.

“The research is going to continue, but it’s going to continue in Europe and Asia and China,” he said. “I agree with President Trump that it would be great to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.; what the U.S. is good at is medical therapies, creativity, new medical inventions. They’re driving that away.”

As proof of the promise of mRNA therapies, many scientists point in particular to results published in February showing their success in pancreatic cancer. The disease has a five-year survival rate of 13 percent; in an ongoing study, an mRNA vaccine has prevented the cancer from returning after four years in some patients.

Some scientists said they had hoped that President Trump would embrace this promise, since his first administration was responsible for Operation Warp Speed, the project that developed and distributed the mRNA vaccines.

At the White House ceremony in January where Mr. Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion public-private partnership to develop artificial intelligence, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, hailed the potential to use A.I. to create personalized mRNA cancer therapies.

But Mr. Trump’s supporters among a network of anti-vaccine activists immediately denounced the president. Del Bigtree, who with Mr. Kennedy co-founded the Make America Healthy Again Action Network, titled an episode of his podcast: “Stargate to Hell?”

“It baffles my mind because the mRNA technology has been around for decades, but Donald Trump introduced it to the world — he should be taking a victory lap,” said Jeff Coller, a professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins and a co-founder of the Alliance for mRNA Medicines, a trade group started in 2023 in part to counter public misunderstandings about mRNA. “But somehow it got warped into mask mandates and shutdowns and the debates over the origins of Covid. These things have become so blurred that people can’t separate it.”

A spokeswoman for the N.I.H. said the request for a list of work being done on mRNA was simply a “data call.” But scientists say they do not trust that it is that simple, given the other signals from Washington.

Dr. Bhattacharya, the new N.I.H. director, once praised the mRNA vaccines, but in an interview last year doubted the safety of all mRNA platforms, saying “it’s going to take two or three more Nobel Prize-winning discoveries before this is ready for prime time.”

Even scientists whose mRNA work does not involve vaccines say they are scrubbing their grants of any mention of it, for fear of tripping up the filters that have been used to cancel grants with other problematic words, like “diversity.”

“The sort of reverse engineering of a problem with mRNA because somebody didn’t like the way Covid was handled is bizarre,” said Dr. Phillip Zamore, the chairman of the RNA Therapeutics Institute at UMass Chan Medical School. “If they don’t like the way a particular cancer treatment is going, we’re not allowed to work on whatever protein causes that cancer?”

The role of mRNA is to carry the genetic messages from DNA to the ribosomes, instructing them to make the proteins that are the building blocks of any organism.

Used in a vaccine, mRNA delivers a message to make proteins that fight disease, essentially instructing the body to make its own medicine. The proteins can turn on an immune response, to fend off Covid or bird flu or stop cancers from growing. They can also tamp down the overactive immune responses that cause diseases like Type 1 diabetes and Crohn’s. Scientists are also exploring mRNA therapies that treat genetic diseases by delivering a correct copy of the flawed gene.

For decades, scientists worried that the technology would not deliver as promised — not because it is not safe but because mRNA breaks down quickly. Would it stick around long enough to set off the intended immune response? Covid proved that it could, and supercharged research into using the same technology to fight other diseases, especially cancers that have resisted traditional therapies.

But the pandemic also supercharged misinformation about the technology. Changing guidance on masks and the spread of the virus fed distrust of science and public health authorities, including those who approved the vaccines. Many of the legislative proposals across the country reflect that.

Proposed bans on mRNA therapies in Montana and South Carolina, for instance, falsely claim that the vaccines are “gene therapies” that can change the human genome and pass on random genetic variations to the next generation, that they are “contaminated” with DNA and other particles, and that they can “shed” to infect others.

Bills in New York would ban mRNA vaccines until studies could determine that the benefits “outweigh the risks.” A proposed moratorium on mRNA use in Idaho is named for a rancher who, the bill says, “was severely injured immediately after receiving a genetic immunization” — though the rancher testified that he was partially paralyzed after receiving a traditional, non-mRNA vaccine.

Utah and Tennessee passed laws requiring foods containing vaccines to be classified as drugs, even though no such foods are on the market. Legislators pointed to a University of California study that is investigating whether it is possible to put vaccines in lettuce.

“You eat a bunch of this lettuce, take a bunch of these mRNA vaccines, and you go back and get your DNA tested again, it’s going to be a little different, it’s not going to be the same as it was that you were born with, that you got from your parents,” Frank Niceley, a Tennessee Republican state senator, said during the debate last year, arguing that the legislature should ban mRNA entirely. “This is dangerous stuff.”

In fact, mRNA vaccines cannot change the genetic code, because they cannot access the nucleus of the cells, where DNA resides. Small amounts of DNA are in all vaccines — often, as with the flu vaccine, because they are made from eggs — but the Food and Drug Administration enforces strict limits, and the levels are so small that they are negligible. Scientists had been conducting clinical trials on mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer for years, well before Covid: on mice in the 1990s and in humans starting in the early 2000s. While no vaccine is without side effects, including deadly ones, the mRNA vaccines often have fewer side effects than traditional vaccines that insert a small amount of live virus.

“mRNA is not some foreign substance, it’s something that you’re exposed to all the time,” said Melissa Moore, who was chief scientific officer at Moderna when it produced the Covid vaccines. “Every time you’re eating whole foods, meat or vegetables, you are consuming lots of mRNA and your body is breaking it down and creating its own.”

Even if the bills do not pass, their proponents say they are playing a long game. Last month, Republicans in Minnesota proposed a ban that would classify mRNA products as weapons of mass destruction, adding it to a list that includes smallpox, anthrax and mustard gas. The ban copied the language of a bill written by a Florida hypnotist, Joseph Sansone, who says he wants to try to get the ban passed in every state and in Congress. In his newsletter, Mr. Sansone praised local Republican organizations that have adopted resolutions in favor of the bans, and encouraged his followers to start showing up at political events to challenge politicians.

It’s “poking them in the eye,” he wrote, “which has an important psychological effect.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746744494.0,Sierra Leone battles mpox surge,"Sierra Leone reported its first mpox cases in January, and activity is now skyrocketing, so much so that the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has added the country to its list of most affected nations.

At a weekly briefing today, however, Ngashi Ngongo, MD, PhD, MPH, who leads Africa CDC's mpox incident management team, said cases are down in the other high-burden countries, such as Burundi, Uganda, and even the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been the main hot spot throughout the region's outbreaks.

""We've started seeing some light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.

**Exponential growth in Sierra Leone**

Last week, Sierra Leone had half of Africa's confirmed cases, with its outbreak expanding over the past 6 weeks and cases up 71% last week compared to the week before. Ngongo added that the country is averaging about 100 new cases a day.

The outbreak in Sierra Leone is driven by clade 2b, the global strain of the virus. Ngongo said 68% of patients are male, mostly 30 to 35 years old.

Seven percent of the illnesses are in people who have HIV, a high-risk group seen in other African countries during the outbreak.

Most of the cases are concentrated in the western part of the country, including Western Area province, which includes Freetown, the country's capital.

He said the country has only 60 mpox isolation beds, and most of the patients are receiving home care, which makes it difficult to ensure compliance with isolation. And though Sierra Leone has good mpox testing coverage and a good testing rate, it currently has a low contact-tracing ratio.

So far, nearly 24,000 people have been vaccinated, almost 60% of them healthcare workers. Other target groups include contacts of patients and people in high-risk areas.

Promising signs in the DRC, other affected nations
Ngongo said the situation in the DRC' North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, where conflict had nearly shut down the response over the past several months, is stabilizing and that officials have started redeploying health workers and restarting vaccination.

Testing coverage has been a challenge owing to insecurity and global health cuts, but he added that testing coverage is rising steadily, at nearly 60%, in Kinshasa, which has been the DRC's other mpox hot spot. 

In Uganda, cases have declined in the past 4 weeks, down 60% from the peak at week 11 of the epidemiologic calendar, he said. The country has also seen higher deaths in people with HIV. 

Of 10 districts that have reported the most cases, illnesses are still elevated in only 2: Masaka City and Holma City.

Burundi's cases are down more than 84% from the peak in late October 2024, and the country has intensified surveillance, with a goal of interrupting the remaining transmission chains.

Though the trends in the main outbreak countries are encouraging, ""we're not yet out of the woods,"" Ngongo said.",1ki3kov,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/sierra-leone-battles-mpox-surge,9

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746718673.0,Genetic Study Retraces the Origins of Coronaviruses in Bats,"In the early 2000s, a coronavirus infecting bats jumped into raccoon dogs and other wild mammals in southwestern China. Some of those animals were sold in markets, where the coronavirus jumped again, into humans. The result was the SARS pandemic, which spread to 33 countries and claimed 774 lives. A few months into it, scientists discovered the coronavirus in mammals known as palm civets sold in a market at the center of the outbreak.

In a study published on Wednesday, a team of researchers compared the evolutionary story of SARS with that of Covid 17 years later. The researchers analyzed the genomes of the two coronaviruses that caused the pandemics, along with 248 related coronaviruses in bats and other mammals.

Jonathan Pekar, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Edinburgh and an author of the new study, said that the histories of the two coronaviruses followed parallel paths. “In my mind, they are extraordinarily similar,” he said.

In both cases, Dr. Pekar and his colleagues argue, a coronavirus jumped from bats to wild mammals in southwestern China. In a short period of time, wildlife traders took the infected animals hundreds of miles to city markets, and the virus wreaked havoc in humans.

“When you sell wildlife in the heart of cities, you’re going to have a pandemic every so often,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and an author of the new study.

The study lands at a fraught political moment. Last month the White House created a web page called “Lab Leak: The True Origin of Covid 19,” asserting that the pandemic had been caused not by a market spillover but by an accident in a lab in Wuhan, China.

On Friday, in its proposed budget, the White House described the lab leak as “confirmed” and justified an $18 billion cut to the National Institutes of Health in part on what it described as the agency’s “inability to prove that its grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology were not complicit in such a possible leak.”

The Chinese government responded with a flat denial that Covid had been caused by a Wuhan lab leak and raised the possibility that the virus had come instead from a biodefense lab in the United States.

“A thorough and in-depth investigation into the origins of the virus should be conducted in the U.S.,” the statement read.

Sergei Pond, a virologist at Temple University, said that he did not consider the origin of Covid settled. But he worried that the incendiary language from the two governments would make it difficult for scientists to investigate — and debate — the origin of Covid.

“If it wasn’t tragic, you’d have to laugh, it’s so farcical,” Dr. Pond said.

In the first weeks of the Covid pandemic in early 2020, claims circulated that the virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, was a biological weapon created by the Chinese Army. A group of scientists who analyzed the data available at the time rejected that idea. Although they couldn’t rule out an accidental lab leak, they favored a natural origin of Covid.

As time passed, Dr. Worobey, who was not part of that group, became frustrated that there was not yet enough evidence to choose one theory over the other. He signed an open letter with 17 other scientists calling for more investigation to determine which explanation was more likely.

“To us it seemed that there was a lot we don’t know, so let’s not discard the lab-leak idea,” Dr. Worobey said. “Let’s study it.”

As Dr. Worobey and other scientists started studying the origin of Covid, American intelligence agencies were also assessing it. Their assessments have been mixed. The F.B.I., and the C.I.A. favor an escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although with only low certainty. The Department of Energy leans with low confidence to the virus escaping from a different lab in Wuhan. Other agencies lean toward a natural origin.

The agencies have not made their evidence or their analyses public, and so scientists cannot evaluate the basis of their conclusions. However, Dr. Worobey and other researchers have published a string of papers in scientific journals. Along the way, Dr. Worobey became convinced that the Covid pandemic had started at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.

“Scientifically, it’s as clear as H.I.V. or Spanish flu,” Dr. Worobey said, referring to two diseases whose origins he has also studied.

For the new study, Dr. Worobey, Dr. Pekar and their colleagues compared the genomes of 250 coronaviruses, using their genetic similarities and differences to determine their relationships. They were able to reconstruct the history of the coronaviruses that cause both SARS and Covid — known as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The ancestors of both coronaviruses circulated in bats across much of China and neighboring countries for hundreds of thousands of years. In the last 50 years or so, their direct ancestors infected bats that lived in southwestern China and northern Laos.

As the coronaviruses infected the bats, they sometimes ended up inside a cell with another coronavirus. When the cell made new viruses, it accidentally created hybrids that carried genetic material from both of the original coronaviruses — a process known as recombination.

“These aren’t ancient events,” said David Rasmussen, a virologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the new study. “These things are happening all the time. These viruses are truly mosaics.”

In 2001, just a year before the SARS pandemic started in the city of Guangzhou, the researchers found, SARS-CoV underwent its last genetic mixing in bats. Only after that last recombination could the virus have evolved into a human pathogen. And since Guangzhou is several hundred miles from the ancestral region of SARS-CoV, bats would not have been able to bring the virus to the city in so little time.

Instead, researchers generally agree, the ancestors of SARS-CoV infected wild mammals that were later sold in markets around Guangzhou. A few months after the start of the SARS pandemic, researchers discovered SARS-CoV in palm civets and other wild mammals for sale in markets.

The researchers found a similar pattern when they turned to SARS-CoV-2, the cause of Covid. The last recombination in bats took place between 2012 and 2014, just five to seven years before the Covid pandemic, several hundred miles to the northeast, in Wuhan.

That was also a substantial departure from the region where the virus’s ancestors had circulated. But it was comparable to the journey that SARS-CoV took, courtesy of the wildlife trade. [...] 

Dr. Pond said that the new study was consistent with the theory of a wildlife spillover. But he does not consider the matter settled. He noted that last year two statisticians took issue with the model behind the 2022 study. Dr. Worobey and a colleague have countered that criticism. “That debate is still ongoing,” Dr. Pond said.

Marc Eloit, the former director of the Pathogen Discovery Laboratory at Pasteur Institute in Paris, said that the new study was significant for providing a clear picture of where SARS-CoV-2 came from.

But he also observed that the coronavirus was markedly different from its closest known relatives in bats. After it split from those viruses, it must have mutated or undergone recombination to become well adapted for spreading in humans.

“I maintain that the possibility of a recombination event — whether accidental or deliberate — in a laboratory setting remains just as plausible as the hypothesis of emergence via an intermediate host on the market,” Dr. Eloit said.

Dr. Eloit and other scientists agreed that finding an intermediate form of SARS-CoV-2 in a wild mammal would make a compelling case for a natural spillover. Chinese authorities looked at some animals at the start of the pandemic and did not find the virus in them.

However, wildlife vendors at the Huanan market removed their animals from the stalls before scientists could study them. And once China put a stop to wildlife sales, farmers culled their animals.

“There’s a big missing piece, and you really can’t dance around it,” said Dr. Pond.

Stephen Goldstein, a geneticist at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new study, said that the research served as a warning about the risk of a future coronavirus pandemic. Wild mammals sold in markets anywhere in the region where SARS and Covid got their start could become a vehicle to a city hundreds of miles away. “The pieces of these viruses exist in all these places,” Dr. Goldstein said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746620489.0,Trump administration has shut down CDC's infection control committee,"The Trump administration has terminated a federal advisory committee that issued guidance about preventing the spread of infections in health care facilities.  

The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) crafted national standards for hand-washing, mask-wearing and isolating sick patients that most U.S. hospitals follow. 

Four committee members said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delivered the news about HICPAC’s termination to members Friday.  

A letter reviewed by NBC News — which members said the CDC sent out after a virtual meeting — says the termination took effect more than a month previously, on March 31. According to the letter, the termination aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for a reduction of the federal workforce.  

Four professional societies previously asked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a letter on March 26 to preserve the committee amid widespread cuts to federal health agencies. The CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 

Several of the committee’s web pages have been archived, meaning they are still available to view online but are no longer being updated. 

Some members now say they fear that its guidelines will be frozen in time, unable to evolve with new scientific research or the spread of drug-resistant organisms, which are a particular threat to hospitals. 

“At some point, when things need to change, the guidelines likely won’t change, and then people will be sort of flying by the seat of their pants,” said Connie Steed, a HICPAC member since 2023 and former president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. 

Dr. Anurag Malani, a fellow at the Infectious Diseases Society of America who joined HICPAC in January, said the committee was close to finalizing new guidelines for airborne pathogens before the termination. The guidelines, which had not been updated since 2007, included a controversial recommendation that would allow surgical masks in lieu of N95 respirators to prevent the spread of certain pathogens. 

“There was really a lot of important material in there and, I think, a lot of lessons learned from Covid that helped shape those guidelines to put us in a better place than we were pre-pandemic,” Malani said.  

Jane Thomason, the lead hygienist at National Nurses United — a professional association for registered nurses that criticized the new mask recommendations — lamented the loss of the committee. HICPAC appointed Thomason to a work group last year.  

“While we had significant concerns regarding HICPAC’s make up and proposed guidance, the termination of the committee removes important public transparency,” Thomason said in a statement Tuesday. “Without HICPAC’s public meetings, there is no longer any public access to the process for drafting CDC guidance on infection control for health care settings. This further undermines safety for patients, nurses, and other health care workers.” [...] ",1kgvyvg,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-shut-cdcs-infection-control-committee-rcna205209,610
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746658199.0,Donald Trump taps wellness influencer close to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for surgeon general,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is tapping Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer with close ties to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as his nominee for surgeon general after withdrawing his initial pick for the influential health post.

Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that Means has “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials” – referring to the “ Make America Healthy Again ” slogan – and that she will work to eradicate chronic disease and improve the health and well-being of Americans.

“Her academic achievements, together with her life’s work, are absolutely outstanding,” Trump said. “Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.”

In doing so, Trump withdrew former Fox News medical contributor Janette Nesheiwat for U.S. surgeon general, marking at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Thursday for her confirmation hearing. [...] 

Casey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts.

In interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions. [...] 

Means has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’s controversial and debunked views on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits.

She trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.

If confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling MAHA agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from U.S. foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs.

[...] 

The surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746632076.0,That mystery brain disease plaguing people in New Brunswick? A new study finds it's not real,"A new study is debunking “an alleged ‘mystery’ neurological illness” that emerged in New Brunswick six years ago.

The research, published Wednesday in JAMA Neurology, took another careful look at 25 cases of people previously diagnosed with what’s dubbed a neurological syndrome of unknown cause (NSUC), 11 of whom have since died.

“There was no evidence supporting a diagnosis of NSUC in this cohort,” the study concludes.

Instead, well-known conditions were identified in all 25 cases, including common neurodegenerative diseases, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer.

“Based on the 11 autopsy cases, a new disease was extremely unlikely, with a probability less than .001,” said the study.

New Brunswick neurologist Dr. Alier Marrero has said he’s seen hundreds of patients in recent years — including some from neighbouring Nova Scotia — who are experiencing inexplicable symptoms of neurological decline. Those include anxieties and difficulty sleeping, as well as more acute symptoms including limb pain and trouble balancing, teeth chattering, violent muscle spasms, vision problems and hallucinations. Many of them were under the age of 45.

Last November, New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said she wanted the Public Health Agency of Canada to investigate.

An oversight committee appointed by Progressive Conservative Blaine Higgs’ former government rejected the idea that the cases are linked. It indicated that most of the patients in the cluster were misdiagnosed.

“Despite these findings, the number of cases reported in the media has grown to more than 500 patients with more than 50 deaths, although (Public Health New Brunswick) has received only 222 verified submissions,” said the new study. “Speculations regarding the underlying cause have included an unknown prion disease, toxins from cyanobacteria, glyphosate, glufosinate, and heavy metals. However, despite extensive media attention, no clinical or pathological case descriptions have been published in the medical literature to our knowledge.”

The sample of 25 cases was drawn from a cohort of 222 people who received an initial NSUC diagnosis.

“Eligible patients were offered a second opinion; four families of deceased patients provided consent for reporting autopsies and waivers of consent were obtained for seven,” said the study.

The research was conducted at Horizon Health Network in New Brunswick and University Health Network in Ontario.

“Complex neurological disorders benefit from a second, independent and/or subspecialist evaluation and require multidisciplinary support throughout the diagnostic journey,” said the study that collected data between November 2023 and this past March.

“Clinical and neuropathological evaluations demonstrated that all 25 cases were attributable to well characterized neurological disorders,” it said. “The final primary diagnoses, and in some cases secondary diagnoses, included Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, other neurodegenerative conditions, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury or persisting post concussion symptoms, and others.”

The independent assessment of 25 patients “provides no support for an undiagnosed mystery disease in New Brunswick,” said the study. 

“The gold standard, neuropathological assessments with second, blinded independent evaluations, revealed well-defined diagnoses for 11 deceased patients.”

When all 25 cases were included in the mix, “100 per cent of patients in this sample did not have a new disease and with 95 per cent confidence, the probability of no new disease is between 87 per cent and 100 per cent,” said the study.

“The lower bound of 87 per cent reflects a conservative estimate based on the data and statistical methods accounting for uncertainty in the sample, including the possibility of diagnostic error or unmeasured variability. However, practical knowledge and clinical reasoning suggest that the actual probability of no new disease is much closer to the upper bound of 100 per cent.”

The new study said “it is crucial to highlight the factors that fuel persistent public concern of a mystery disease despite the provincial investigation rejecting this possibility. Public trust in health institutions has decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, while trust in individual healthcare professionals remains high, which can make vulnerable people susceptible to claims that the institutional oversight processes are flawed, especially if originating from trusted physicians.”

The new research comes with a caution.

Misinformation regarding the New Brunswick “cluster has proliferated in both traditional and social media, from not only the predictable and easily identifiable groups coopting the crisis to suit their agenda, such as antivaccine advocates, but also those who are unknowingly amplifying an incorrect diagnosis from their physician,” said the study.

“In this way, misdiagnosis and misinformation become inextricably entwined and amplify patient harm exponentially: to the best of our knowledge, only 14 patients sought independent reevaluation by another neurologist when offered, and 52 refused a second opinion, choosing instead to remain with the one neurologist who originally made and continues to promote the diagnosis of a mystery disease. Not only do our data indicate that affected patients likely have other diagnosable neurological conditions that could benefit from multidisciplinary treatment and other resources, but the low uptake also impedes the rigorous scientific evaluations necessary to counter the claims raised in the first place.”",1kh0crx,https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/new-brunswick-mystery-brain-disease-neurological-syndrome-of-unknown-cause?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=NP_social,37

Texas, like several other states, also continues to report a spate of other measles illnesses not linked to the main outbreak. The state has recorded 16 such cases.

Other states have reported measles cases linked to the Texas outbreak, and today Oklahoma reported one more infection, raising its total to 17, which includes three probable cases.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746619537.0,H5N1 and H5N6 Co-circulation Leads to the Emergence of Seven Novel Genotypes in China,"China has often been called the `cradle of influenza', primarily because human, avian, and swine influenza viruses circulate there more-or-less year round, population densities are very high, and because live poultry markets and backyard livestock afford ample opportunities for spillovers.

During the 20th century, 2 of the 3 major influenza pandemics (1957 Asian Flu, 1968 Hong Kong Flu) are thought to have originated from this region. The emergence and global spread of H5 A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (gs/GD) lineage in Southeastern China in the mid-1990's only helped to cement that reputation.

In March of 2013, in EID Journal: Predicting Hotspots for Influenza Virus Reassortment, we looked at a paper that identified areas of the globe most likely to spawn the next novel flu virus.

Timing, as they say, is everything. Less than 3 weeks later, China announced the emergence of the biggest avian flu threat seen to date - H7N9 - which first appeared (as predicted) in the central coastal provinces of China (Anhui, Shanghai). Over the next 5 years it would spark 5 distinct waves with an apparent fatality rate (among those hospitalized) of roughly 30%.

A few months later the first of several H10Nx infections were reported in China, and in 2014 they reported the first of (now > 90) H5N6 spillover events, which have been fatal in roughly 50% of reported cases. 

China also leads the world in reported human H9N2 infections, and has detected a handful of other zoonotic influenza spillovers (H7N4, H3N8, etc.).

While official reports of novel flu outbreaks and infections from China (and elsewhere) are often belated, `sanitized', or are only released `strategically' (see From Here To Impunity), we've seen a steady stream of refreshingly blunt scientific papers coming out of China warning on the increasing incidence, and complexity, of their novel flu viruses. [...] 

**To this list we have a report - published yesterday in Emerging Microbes & Infections - which details the increasingly complex, unique, and intertwined constellation of HPAI H5 viruses circulating in China.**

While China's H5N6 virus has been on our radar for more than a decade, it - unlike H5N1 - has only rarely been detected in wild or migratory birds. It has remained geographically limited to Mainland China, with a few excursions into Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

That, however, may be changing as H5N6 continues to co-circulate with, and reassort with, the vagabond clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus. The authors report:

>. . a novel H5N6 genotype, N6.4, has been detected, whose HA gene and some internal gene fragments are directly derived from G-II H5N1 viruses. Animal experimental results further confirm that the N6.4 virus shows greater virulence and pathogenicity in chicken and mouse models than G-I H5N6 viruses, suggesting that it has enhanced adaptability and a heightened potential for cross-host transmission.""

>Although the risk of human-to-human transmission of H5 viruses is still low now, their expanding host range and the outbreak of H5N1 in the US dairy cattle emphasize that Clade 2.3.4.4b viruses are constantly adapting to mammals[51,52].

>Since 2023, seven H5 virus genotypes have emerged in China. However, overall genetic diversity remains lower than in Europe and the Americas[53]. This is partly attributable to inactivated vaccines are widely used in China, effectively curbing the spread of H5 viruses[54,55]. Also, H5N6 mainly spreads in poultry, restricting its gene pool expansion. Nevertheless, the emergence of new N6.3 and N6.4 genotypes in 2024 indicates that the co-circulation of H5N1 and H5N6 viruses is driving viral diversity evolution in China.

>Antigenic analysis shows that vaccine-induced antisera have good cross-reactivity with Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 isolates. Yet, given the ongoing genetic reassortment and evolution of H5 viruses, it is crucial to continue updating vaccine strains dynamically. In the future, monitoring of H5 viruses and vaccine development should be strengthened to provide solid scientific support for AI prevention and control in China, and contribute Chinese expertise to global AI prevention.

We rarely see reports of H5N6 in Chinese poultry, likely because the H5+H7 vaccines used in China can sometimes mask the symptoms while still allowing them to spread (see Preprint: Association of Poultry Vaccination with the Interspecies Transmission and Molecular Evolution of H5 Subtype Avian Influenza Virus).

Often, when human cases do emerge, testing of asymptomatic flocks turns up the virus (see China CDC Weekly: Infection Tracing and Virus Genomic Analysis of Two Cases of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A(H5N6) — Fujian Province, China).

The prospect of seeing a more host-adaptable or more widespread H5N6 virus is not a welcome one. And since reassortment can be a two-way street, anything that might increase the virulence of our current H5N1 virus would be equally unwelcome.

While the recent lull in human case reports in the United States is encouraging - given the limits of surveillance and reporting - most of H5's evolution and global spread occurs outside of our view.

The brief glimpses we do get, however, suggest any respite we enjoy today may be fleeting.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746558654.0,Scientists estimate higher rate of new-onset diabetes after COVID than in general population,"Today in Emerging Microbes & Infections, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine–Qatar present a systematic review of 35 studies on new-onset diabetes after COVID-19 infection, estimating an incidence of 1.37%.

The researchers mined databases to identify and analyze studies from around the world on COVID-related type 1 or type 2 diabetes published up to October 2023. The studies included a total of 4.4 million COVID-19 patients of all ages, and 47.7% were male.

**Vast majority of cases were type 2**

Of the 4.4 million COVID-19 patients, 60,189 (1.37%) had new-onset diabetes (0.84% type 2, 0.017% type 1). The type of diabetes wasn't available for 28 studies (0.51% of cases).

Factors associated with incident diabetes were SARS-CoV-2 variant type, severity of infection, underlying medical conditions, demographic factors, and vaccination status. The risk of diabetes rose over time, with the highest rates seen at 3 to 12 months post-infection.

The study authors noted that the real-world incidence could be higher because many studies reported cases of new-onset diabetes only for patients who returned to the hospital for readmission or follow up. 

""However, this rate is still higher than the estimated rate of new onset diabetes in a general population,"" they wrote. ""For example, among adults aged 18 years or older in the USA, the crude estimates for 2021 were 1.2 million new cases of diabetes (0.59%).""

The exact causes of post-COVID diabetes are unclear, the researchers said: ""The mechanisms behind COVID-19-induced diabetes may include direct damage of the pancreatic beta cells, inflammation, insulin resistance, and autoimmune responses.""

They recommended that healthcare providers monitor COVID-19 survivors for signs of new-onset diabetes, particularly those with risk factors such as hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, severe infection, pre-existing metabolic disorders, and COVID-19 variants associated with higher risks.

""A multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, primary care physicians, and infectious disease specialists should be implemented in the management of post-COVID patients to address both the acute and long-term complications, including metabolic changes and risk of diabetes,"" they added.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746474031.0,"Thirty years on, our research linking viral infections with Alzheimer’s is finally getting the attention it deserves","The common cold sore virus, which is often caught in childhood, usually stays in the body for life – quietly dormant in the nerves. Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people. But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious: Alzheimer’s disease.

Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a surprising discovery. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people. It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called “blood-brain barrier”.

Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer’s, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is many times greater.

To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we infected with the virus. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.

We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation. Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer’s in some people.

We later found the virus’s DNA inside the sticky clumps of these proteins, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.

Large population studies by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer’s, and that specific antiviral treatment reduced the risk.

Our research didn’t stop there. We wondered if other viruses that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.

Shingles vaccine offers another clue
When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop dementia at all.

A new Stanford University-led study gave similar results.

This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer’s. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer’s.

We then explored how risk factors for Alzheimer’s such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.

Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer’s. But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn’t happen.

All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer’s, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.

What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.",1kfktzz,https://theconversation.com/thirty-years-on-our-research-linking-viral-infections-with-alzheimers-is-finally-getting-the-attention-it-deserves-254656,923
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746541443.0,"Measles slowing? Flu deaths, water safety, and lots of talk in vaccines (via Your Local Epidemiologist)","Good morning! This is coming a day late—I was in New York over the weekend for a graduation, and there's truly nothing more energizing than being around students.

Here’s your dose: the context behind this week’s public health headlines. From shifting disease trends and overlooked drowning risks to the latest in vaccine falsehoods and messy talking points—here’s what you need to know, and why it matters.

Flu and Covid activity remain very low nationwide—normal for this time of year. But we’re now seeing final tallies from this past winter, and the U.S. just recorded the highest number of pediatric flu deaths in recent years.

Flu vaccination rates continue to decline—year after year since 2019. This may be our new normal, and it’s hard to swallow.

**Measles**

As of Sunday, the U.S. had 967 confirmed cases. We are getting closer and closer to reaching the record high (1,200) since we eliminated measles in 2000.

Of that, 817 cases are from the Southwest outbreak. The good news is that it may be slowing down in West Texas. We know this from three soft data points:

This is the first week with no hospitalized children in West Texas for measles.

A downward trend in reported weekly cases (a promising “epi curve” below). Ultimately, we want a bell-shaped curve, which may be starting to take shape.

Fewer new cases are reported anecdotally by clinicians on the ground.

Transmission continues, just at a slower pace. While any case could still spark a new outbreak in communities with low vaccination rates (for example, all eyes are on El Paso right now), big thanks to the public health workers working to contain.

Other sporadic cases continue to pop up in the past week. Also, a small outbreak in Montana continues to grow, and a new outbreak in North Dakota:

Illinois: +2 (unrelated cases)

Montana: 7 (+2: household cluster)

Ohio: +1

Arkansas: +1

California: +1

North Dakota +4

Missouri +1

[...] 

**Vaccines & placebos: Let’s clear the air**

RFK Jr. recently claimed that “none of the vaccines on the CDC’s childhood recommended schedule was tested against an inert placebo, meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products.” That’s not true—but it’s also more nuanced than a soundbite allows.

A lot of our vaccines have been tested against placebos, like saline. (Here is a running list a few infectious disease doctors put together.) When we have a brand new pathogen, like Covid-19 or RSV, this is important in evaluating safety and efficacy.

However, some vaccines haven’t been tested against a saline placebo but rather against another vaccine. Scientists do this when they combine vaccines, change strains, or develop a next-generation vaccine. These “bridge studies” allow scientists to see if the new vaccine (or drug) is as good or better than the original vaccine (that went through a placebo clinical trial). If not, they don’t go to market. This is like building blocks, advancing from a foundation rooted in randomized placebo trials.

Two reasons why we do it this way:

Ethics: We can’t withhold known protection. In other words, we cannot give someone a placebo vaccine if there’s already a better alternative to getting the disease. Imagine testing a better car seat by giving half the kids no seat.

Feasibility: Some vaccines (like flu) are updated yearly to match circulating strains. These are tweaks—not new products. In this case, we don’t have a randomized control trial because the virus mutates too quickly.

What it means for you: Vaccine science is complex, but our current processes are top of the line. Falsehoods, half-truths, or messy talking points—especially when amplified by the highest health office in the U.S.—can be confusing and do real harm.

**State legislation targeting mRNA vaccines**

Falsehoods can turn into policy changes. Several states are considering bills that would restrict or even criminalize mRNA vaccines:

Iowa: Providers could face fines of up to $500 for administering mRNA vaccines (approved by a Senate subcommittee).

Idaho: Would ban mRNA vaccines for ten years; six counties already restrict the health department from distributing Covid vaccines.

Montana: Considered a similar action, but was defeated in the House.

Minnesota: A bill to label mRNA vaccines “weapons of mass destruction” (unlikely to pass).

These bills build upon false claims that mRNA technology is gene-editing and/or gene-based, a falsehood we debunked as early as 2020.

Why would this be bad? Beyond Covid-19, mRNA technology is revolutionizing treatments for cancer and other diseases. Early clinical trials show dramatic survival improvements in pancreatic cancer (overall survival, which was previously 10%, has increased to 50% in a Phase 1 clinical trial) and kidney cancer (in a Phase 1 trial, the vaccine appeared to be essentially curative), with the potential to transform outcomes for some of the hardest-to-treat illnesses. Cutting off this technology would be devastating for patients—and medical progress.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746531494.0,LA County declares hepatitis A outbreak,"Public health officials say cases of hepatitis A have more than tripled in L.A. County since 2023, prompting the county to declare an outbreak.

Last year, 165 cases were identified; there have been 29 to date this year. Typically, the county sees 30 to 50 cases a year.

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that affects the liver. It’s most often spread when people eat food or drink water that’s been contaminated by the virus, and contamination usually happens because people did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom.

Most people recover from hepatitis A without lasting liver damage, but in some cases it can lead to liver failure or be deadly.

The L.A. County Department of Public Health identified the uptick in cases using a new tool: wastewater analysis.

“Because we are beginning to see this increase again, and because most of our cases do not have risk factors, we are letting everyone know that any L.A. resident who hasn't been previously vaccinated for hepatitis A should go ahead and get vaccinated,” said Dr. Sharon Balter, director of the county public health department’s division of communicable disease control and prevention.



Since 2023, they’ve analyzed samples from the Hyperion and A.K. Warren wastewater treatment plants, which receive sewage from about 75% of L.A. County residents.

Public health officials initially thought the outbreak that began in 2024 was getting better, but this year's numbers are elevated again.

In just the first three months of 2025, 29 cases of hepatitis A have been identified, compared to just 14 cases during the same time period in 2024. At least seven people have died during this outbreak, officials said at a news conference Monday.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746472600.0,US scientist who touted hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid named to pandemic prevention role,"A proponent of using the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 despite scant evidence of its efficacy has been named to a top pandemic prevention role at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Washington Post reports.

Steven J Hatfill is a virologist who served in Donald Trump’s first administration, during which he promoted hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus in the early months of the pandemic, when vaccines and treatments were not yet available. He recently started as a special adviser in the office of the director of the administration for strategic preparedness and response, which prepares the country to respond to pandemics, as well as chemical and biological attacks.

The Trump administration embraced using the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, along with other drugs such as ivermectin and chloroquine, as treatments against Covid-19, despite concerns over both their efficacy and potentially serious side-effects. In June 2020, just months after the pandemic started, the Food and Drug Administration warned against using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19 over “reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues”, even after Trump approved ordering millions of doses of the drug for US patients from Brazil.

Last year, a study released at the onset of the pandemic that promoted hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 was withdrawn by the publisher of the medical journal.

In an interview with the Post, Hatfill defended his support of hydroxychloroquine, which remains in use to treat diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. “There is no ambiguity there. It is a safe drug,” Hatfill said, noting that “they gave the drug to the president” in 2020.

In his new job, Hatfill said he would “help get us ready for the next pandemic” and work with his agency’s scientists on achieving “complete awareness of the scientific literature, not just for influenza, bird flu or Covid but other global diseases that could represent a threat to the US”. 

“It is unfortunate that the Department of Health and Human Services has hired a senior adviser whose views about some Covid-19 drugs are not grounded in the evidence,” said Robert Steinbrook, the director of the health research group for progressive non-profit Public Citizen.

“It has been established many times that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are not effective drugs for Covid-19. Officials who help the United States prepare for pandemics and biological and chemical attacks should evaluate new medicines and vaccines based on science, not their personal views.”

Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former appointee under Joe Biden, told the Washington Post: “My hope is that Dr Hatfill will pursue the things that are of greatest value in preparing for another pandemic, such as new medicines and vaccines.”

He noted that hydroxychloroquine “doesn’t cure Covid and has risks”.

In 2021, a Democratic-led House subcommittee investigating the pandemic response made public emails from Hatfill indicating that he was among the White House officials who looked for evidence that backed up Trump’s false claims of vote rigging following his election defeat the year prior.

A health ministry spokesperson said in an email that the government wouldn’t disclose their ages out of concern for privacy.

At a press conference Monday, Dr. Sunil Sookram, Alberta’s interim chief medical officer of health, said there have been no deaths.

Sookram said the risk of getting the highly contagious disease in Alberta is at its greatest point in almost 30 years.

He was appointed to the role last month, after the province’s former top public health official declined to stay on when his contract ended.

“Up until now we thought the disease had been eradicated, but things have changed,” said Sookram.

“Measles is now circulating in several areas in our province, and it’s quite concerning.” 

Alberta reported 55 new cases Monday, bringing the provincial total to 265 since the beginning of March.

The majority of confirmed cases are in children, with 77 of those under five.

Alberta Health Services also issued an alert warning that an individual who was contagious recently attended the south Edmonton Cineplex Odeon movie theatre.

The health authority said anyone who attended the theatre on April 26 between 8:30 p.m. and 1 a.m. the next morning and who hasn’t received two doses of the measles vaccine is at risk.

Health Minister Adriana LaGrange announced that the government will be launching a vaccination campaign featuring advertising in a variety of formats and languages, as well as a measles hotline.

“The campaign is simple: ‘Don’t get measles. Get immunized,’” she said, adding that the government is also looking to provide daycares with information for parents.

LaGrange said the government’s existing social media advertising campaign encouraging Albertans to check their vaccination status has been a success, but “we realize we need to do more.”

“Our hope is that this awareness campaign increases immunization rates and makes sure that Albertans have the access to information that they require as well,” LaGrange said.

“Getting immunized against measles is the single most important thing you can do to protect your loved ones and yourself and your community.”",1kfkqhl,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/alberta/alberta-ramps-up-measles-vaccination-push-as-3-children-in-intensive-care/article_7a06652f-387e-5d72-9bda-6cd32f3889aa.html,64
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746390514.0,Will America be “flying blind” on bird flu? A key wastewater-tracking program may soon end,"Peering into wastewater for public health has a history dating back at least to the late 19th century, when a biologist in Boston cultured sewage in beef jelly, bouillon, boiled potatoes, and milk to see if anything would grow. Later, scientists in Scotland looked at wastewater to assess the spread of typhoid. After injecting monkeys with sewage in the 1930s, American researchers realized that wastewater polio virus concentrations correlated with community infections. It was the COVID-19 pandemic, however, that led to skyrocketing investment in wastewater disease surveillance in the United States—this time with the aid of modern biotechnology and without bouillon or monkeys.

As COVID transitioned from a deadly novelty to something closer to a mundane nuisance, testing for the virus fell off a cliff. Wastewater surveillance became central to public health officials’ ability to track COVID. The same is true for other threats, like H5N1 avian influenza. Bird flu has now spread from wild birds, to poultry, to cattle, and, worryingly, to a wide variety of other mammals, including people. Still testing remains limited. The federal government has invested at least $500 million in building wastewater-surveillance capacity since 2021. But that funding expires in September. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist who is the director of The Brown University Pandemic Center, told me we may soon be left with an even murkier understanding of how diseases like COVID and bird flu are spreading.

“We’re kind of flying blind, and we will be totally blind if we get rid of wastewater,” she said of H5N1 surveillance when I spoke with her in late April. While some potential use cases of wastewater surveillance, like the ability to track infections to specific buildings or test for drug use, raise ethical questions, wastewater testing is overall one of the most exciting developments of the pandemic era, she said.  She worries that it could disappear later this year. “What I keep hearing is that this could go away as of the summer,” Nuzzo said. “I have gotten multiple confirmations from people that there is deep concern about that.” [...] 

**Will federal wastewater surveillance continue to be funded?**

What I keep hearing is that this could go away as of the summer. I have gotten multiple confirmations from people that there is deep concern about that. I will also say we have multiple different forms of wastewater surveillance, and states may choose to do it on their own. But if we wanted a national picture of what’s happening, the worry is that it would go away. My concern is that states probably won’t keep doing it, because they’re going to have budgetary constraints.

**In terms of the United States’ efforts to prevent H5N1 from becoming a pandemic, how big of a hit would it be if federal wastewater surveillance funding dried up?**

Let’s just say that the human surveillance is terrible. The testing on farms is pretty terrible. The ag (agricultural) testing is pretty terrible. There’s also questions about the continued availability of ag testing. I’m not an ag person, but I’ve heard from some ag folks that some of the labs and some of the people overseeing the ag testing or ag H5N1 response are either gone or imperiled by recent funding cuts. We don’t really have H5N1 testing. The best we have right now is wastewater, and it’s really limited.

There are an increasing number of reasons to be worried about H5N1. I know a lot of colleagues who are certain it won’t become a pandemic. I continue to try to understand that perspective, but so far, I’ve not been convinced that there’s any particular data underpinning that. I think it’s largely based on a belief of “it hasn’t happened, so it won’t happen.” That’s not how statistics work. [...] 


**How concerning is the overall H5N1 picture at this point for you?**

I’m deeply worried. I have seen no data that makes me less worried. Now it’s true, recent infections have largely been mild. But we had a 13-year-old in British Columbia who was hospitalized for more than a month. We don’t know how the 13-year-old contracted it. That does not make me feel good; I’ve got a 12-year-old at home.

A degree of immunity may exist in the population as a result of the H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009, but I don’t know what that means for individuals. When someone asks me, “How worried should I be as someone who works with animals,” I can’t tell them. I don’t know if they have protection and to what degree. I continue to be worried seeing what this virus does to people, seeing what it does to animal models like ferrets, seeing what it has historically done. Historically, 50 percent of the known cases have died.

I will say we are likely missing milder infections. We know this, but all of the serologic studies that have been done, including in high-risk populations, including in outbreak areas, have suggested we miss some mild infections. They have not told us that we are missing a whole lot such that our understanding of the percentage of infections that result in fatalities is vastly off. A lot of people just want to say, “Well, 50 percent case fatality, that’s got to be wrong.” Yes, it’s wrong. COVID was probably 1 percent case fatality. We have a long way to go for H5N1 to be deeply worrisome.

In terms of a pandemic scenario, I have to be clear H5N1 is not the pandemic virus. It has to change to become a pandemic virus, and whether it will change through the small little drifts that we’ve been seeing—that’s a possibility. The most likely scenario that all the virologists will tell you about is that it reassorts with another flu virus, in which case it may not be H5N1. What the next pandemic flu virus will be, and how severe it will be, we just simply don’t know.

But what we do know is that flu pandemics happen regularly. There were three of them in the 1900s. So we have a whole lot of data that we will have another flu pandemic.

**Is H5N1 of particular concern, more so than just any other flu virus?**

It has long been a worry because we generally understand that pandemic viruses often start in animals then move to humans, and we’ve seen H5N1 do that. It is a particular worry today because in the last two years we’ve seen this virus do things that it didn’t do before: There’s been a rapid geographic expansion and a rapid expansion in terms of numbers of species infected.

A pandemic is a term of geographic spread. It is not a term of severity. We could have another pandemic and have it be mild, or we could have another pandemic and have it be like the 1918 great influenza. We just simply don’t know. There are an increasing number of reasons to be worried about H5N1. I know a lot of colleagues who are certain it won’t become a pandemic. I continue to try to understand that perspective, but so far, I’ve not been convinced that there’s any particular data underpinning that. I think it’s largely based on a belief of “it hasn’t happened, so it won’t happen.” That’s not how statistics work. 

**Can you characterize for me the US government’s response to the H5N1 threat? There’s been upheaval at the health agencies. How do you think we’re doing?**

I’m deeply worried and deeply dismayed by the level of concern that exists for this virus. To be clear, I was very critical of the Biden administration’s response to H5N1, and I continue to be critical of the US government’s response to H5N1 under Trump. I have more reasons to be worried now, because I think we are systematically dismantling many of the systems that exist to protect us from this and many other viruses, including the firing of the USDA (US Department of Agriculture) folks who were working on this and including the lack of information-sharing between CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and state health departments.

There used to be regular calls with outside experts that I would participate in so that I could keep tabs on what was going on. They’re not happening anymore. They haven’t happened since the start of the Trump administration. I cannot conclude anything from that other than stuff’s just not happening. I would love to be proven wrong. I would love them to say, “No, we’re doing all this stuff in the background.” I just see no evidence of it. At the same time, there are a lot of people in public health who will say, “Well, we don’t really think this as the next threat.” I would love that to be the case, but I have no evidence that makes me able to say that. Hope is not a strategy, and I think we are relying way too much on hope right now.

I’m also worried about medical countermeasures, there’s been rumors about potentially canceling contracts with additional vaccine companies. I have worries about surveillance infrastructure and testing.

I don’t think we have faced the facts this virus is not going away. This will be a long-term threat to human health on farms and economic security and economic competitiveness because the United States is so far much more affected than other countries. And the strategies for dealing with the situation on farms, I think, just assume that this virus is going to up and move out of the country or just disappear in a few months. And that’s just simply not the case. It is not going away. We need long term strategies to help farms not become infected with this virus and to rapidly respond if they do.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746416238.0,Alabama: Human West Nile Virus case confirmed in Mobile County,"
The Mobile County Health Department confirmed a human case of West Nile Virus (WNV), the first case in the county this year.

Humans with WNV and other mosquito-borne diseases often have symptoms of high fever, severe headache, nausea, stiff neck, confusion, muscle weakness, paralysis, disorientation, and seizures that are severe enough to require medical attention. In rare cases, WNV can cause coma or death. The seriousness of an illness may depend on a person’s health and age.

The risk of encephalitis spread by mosquitoes is highest from August through the first freeze in the fall. Vector Services will increase spraying and conduct door-to-door surveys in the immediate areas. Inspectors will also attempt to trap adult mosquitoes and test them for the presence of WNV.

Health Officer for Mobile County, Dr. Kevin Michaels warns warns that it is extremely important that people taking part in outdoor activities make every effort to reduce their exposure to mosquitoes and should always keep mosquito repellent with them when outdoors. Mosquito activity peaks at dusk and again at dawn. He goes on to advise that draining standing water will stop mosquitoes from multiplying, cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house and cover skin with clothing or appropriate repellent.

WNV is transmitted from bird to mosquito to bird. Mosquitoes can spread these viruses by feeding on the blood of infected birds and then biting another host animal or mammal, such as a human or a horse.

Although humans and horses can become ill from the infection, the disease cannot be spread from people or horses. The likelihood of transmission to humans and horses can be decreased by personal mosquito avoidance and the use of WNV and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) vaccines in horses. There are no WNV or EEE vaccines available for humans.

In 2024, 1,466 human West Nile Virus cases, including 1,063 neuroinvasive disease cases were reported from 48 states.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746306732.0,"World may be ‘post-herd immunity’ to measles, top US scientist says","A leading immunologist warned of a “post-herd-immunity world”, as measles outbreaks affect communities with low vaccination rates in the American south-west, Mexico and Canada.

The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak has killed two unvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.

“We’re living in a post-herd-immunity world. I think the measles outbreak proves that,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

“Measles – because it is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, the most contagious human disease really – it is the first to come back.”

The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 jurisdictions. Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.

Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and the US now account for the overwhelming majority of roughly 2,300 measles cases across the World Health Organization’s six-country Americas region, according to the health authority’s update this week. Risk of measles is considered high in the Americas, and has grown 11-fold compared with 2024.

Only slightly behind, data released earlier this week from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO also noted that measles cases across Europe were up tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That data also indicated that the 2024 measles cases in Europe followed a seasonal pattern, which was not previously noted in 2021 through 2023.

Of the European cases, which reportedly hit 35,212 for 2024, 87% were reported in Romania. The ECDC said the dip in vaccine rates has impacted the recent spike in measles, with only three countries, Hungary, Malta and Portugal, having coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.

“This virus was imported, traveling country to country,” said Leticia Ruíz, the director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua, Mexico, according to the Associated Press.

Many cases are in areas with large populations of tight-knit Mennonite communities. The religious group has a history of migration through the American south-west, Mexico and Canada.

Mennonite teaching does not explicitly prohibit immunization, according to an expert in the religion. However, as some in the Mennonite community in Texas resist assimilation and speak a dialect of Low German, community members may have limited contact with public health authorities, leading to lower vaccination rates.

Immunologists fear the rate of infection of such diseases – and the unnecessary suffering they bring – will increase as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, spreads misleading claims about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases, undermines public confidence in vaccines’ benefits, threatens to make some vaccines less accessible, guts public health infrastructure and pushes leading vaccine experts out of the department. 

The National Institutes of Health said it would launch a “universal” influenza vaccine trial with $500m in funding, but the news comes as the administration displays hostility toward Covid-19 vaccines.

“Here, Robert F Kennedy Jr is exactly who he has been for the last 20 years. He’s an anti-vaccine activist, he is a science denialist and a conspiracy theorist,” said Offit.

“He has a fixed belief that vaccines are doing more harm than good – as he’s said over and over again.”

Although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine. Just this week, Kennedy told a crowd that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.

Kennedy’s health department also stated this week that it would implement new safety surveillance systems and approval requirements for vaccines, but did not provide any specifics about the design.

Experts said running certain trials, such as for a decades-old vaccine like MMR, would be unethical because it could expose people to a dangerous disease when an intervention is known to be safe.

Kennedy recently visited the most affected community in Texas, centered in Gaines county, in his capacity as health secretary. There, he made misleading claims about measles treatment, including that the antibiotic clarithromycin and steroid budesonide had led to “miraculous and instantaneous recovery”.

The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective. Still, Kennedy has said he will ask the CDC to study vitamins and drugs to treat the viral disease. [...] ",1ke3b5c,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity,318

Compared to 153 total state cases in 2024, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) has identified 164 cases in the first four months of 2025. Nationwide, over 8,400 cases have been reported this year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

LDH reported that 40 people have been hospitalized with whooping cough, or pertussis, since September 2024, with 70% of those being babies younger than 1 year old. Two babies in Louisiana have reportedly died with the rise in cases.

Experts said whooping cough peaks every two to five years, occurring around this time of the year and in the fall. State Epidemiologist Theresa Sokol described the surge in cases as a “return” to disease activity patterns before the COVID-19 pandemic.

“What I can tell you is that we had a very low number of cases during the pandemic because people were practicing mitigation measures that decrease the spread of respiratory diseases,” Sokol told Louisiana First News.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746280620.0,WHO warns of anthrax outbreak in DRC,"In a statement released on Thursday, WHO reported that 16 suspected and one confirmed human cases of the disease have been recorded in North Kivu Province in the east of the country.

“There has been one death among the cases. The outbreak has affected four health zones around Lake Edward on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. It is linked to the one that is ongoing on the Ugandan side of the lake, where seven suspected human cases have been reported in the western Kabale district. Response efforts are ongoing, including livestock vaccination”, reads the statement in part.

In DRC, WHO is assessing to determine the risk of the infection spreading further and is supporting health authorities to strengthen the response, including disease surveillance and investigation to identify the source of the outbreak and chains of transmission, as well as provision of medical supplies and treatment. WHO is also facilitating cross-border coordination between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda to enhance outbreak response.

“Our efforts are focused on swiftly breaking the animal-to-human transmission. We’re working closely with the government, communities and partners to strengthen response measures to protect public health now and in the future,” said Dr Boureima Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Anthrax is a bacterial infection that mainly affects animals. People can get the disease directly or indirectly from infected animals or through exposure to infected or contaminated animal products. Anthrax in humans is not generally regarded as contagious, although rare records of person-to-person transmission exist.

The disease has three forms in humans, all needing prompt medical attention. The most common is cutaneous anthrax, which happens when spores come into contact with broken skin, causing an itchy bump that turns into a black sore. This form can also lead to headaches, muscle aches, fever, and vomiting.

Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs from eating infected meat, causing food poisoning-like symptoms that can worsen to severe stomach pain, bloody vomiting, and diarrhoea. The rarest and most serious form is inhalation anthrax, which results from breathing in the spores, starting with cold-like symptoms before rapidly leading to severe breathing problems and shock. All human cases of anthrax require hospitalisation.

The disease is treatable with antibiotics, which need to be prescribed by a medical professional. Vaccines exist for livestock and humans. However, human vaccines are in limited supply and used primarily for the protection of selected individuals with possible occupational exposure to anthrax.

Initial alerts about the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo were raised on 22 March 2025 in Virunga National Park, where dozens of buffalo and hippopotamuses have died.

Now, WHO reports that efforts are underway to vaccinate livestock in communities living near rivers as veterinary teams safely dispose of animal carcasses to avoid potential infection, while public awareness campaigns are being stepped up to enhance preventive measures.

Preventing the disease in animals protects human health. Experts say response through One Health, a unified approach to safeguard human, environmental and animal health, is vital in addressing the full spectrum of disease control – from prevention to detection, preparedness, response and management, thus contributing to global health security.",1kdtkh0,https://www.independent.co.ug/who-warns-of-anthrax-outbreak-in-drc/,27

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746188835.0,"The MMR vaccine doesn’t contain ‘aborted fetus debris’, as RFK Jr has claimed. Here’s the science","Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the United States’ top public health official, recently claimed some religious groups avoid the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine because it contains “aborted fetus debris” and “DNA particles”.

The US is facing its worst measles outbreaks in years with nearly 900 cases across the country and active outbreaks in several states.

At the same time, Kennedy, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, continues to erode trust in vaccines.

**So what can we make of his latest claims?**

There’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine
Kennedy said “aborted fetus debris” in MMR vaccines is the reason many religious people refuse vaccination. He referred specifically to the Mennonites in Texas, a deeply religious community, who have been among the hardest hit by the current measles outbreaks.

Many vaccines work by using a small amount of an attenuated (weakened) form of a virus, or in the case of the MMR vaccine, attenuated forms of the viruses that cause measles, mumps and rubella. This gives the immune system a safe opportunity to learn how to recognise and respond to these viruses.

As a result, if a person is later exposed to the actual infection, their immune system can react swiftly and effectively, preventing serious illness.

Kennedy’s claim about fetal debris specifically refers to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine. The rubella virus is generally grown in a human cell line known as WI-38, which was originally derived from lung tissue of a single elective abortion in the 1960s. This cell line has been used for decades, and no new fetal tissue has been used since.

Certain vaccines for other diseases, such as chickenpox, hepatitis A and rabies, have also been made by growing the viruses in fetal cells.

These cells are used not because of their origin, but because they provide a stable, safe and reliable environment for growing the attenuated virus. They serve only as a growth medium for the virus and they are not part of the final product.

You might think of the cells as virus-producing factories. Once the virus is grown, it’s extracted and purified as part of a rigorous process to meet strict safety and quality standards. What remains in the final vaccine is the virus itself and stabilising agents, but not human cells, nor fetal tissue.

So claims about “fetal debris” in the vaccine are false.

It’s also worth noting the world’s major religions permit the use of vaccines developed from cells originally derived from fetal tissue when there are no alternative products available.

**Are there fragments of DNA in the MMR vaccine?**

Kennedy claimed the Mennonites’ reluctance to vaccinate stems from “religious objections” to what he described as “a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles” in the MMR vaccine.

The latter claim, about the vaccine containing DNA particles, is technically true. Trace amounts of DNA fragments from the human cell lines used to produce the rubella component of the MMR vaccine may remain even after purification.

However, with this claim, there’s an implication these fragments pose a health risk. This is false.

Any DNA that may be present in this vaccine exists in extremely small amounts, is highly fragmented and degraded, and is biologically inert – that is, it cannot cause harm.

Even if, hypothetically, intact DNA were present in the vaccine (which it’s not), it would not have the capacity to cause harm. One common (but unfounded) concern is that foreign DNA could integrate with a person’s own DNA, and alter their genome.

Introducing DNA into human cells in a way that leads to integration is very difficult. Even when scientists are deliberately trying to do this, for example, in gene therapy, it requires precise tools, special viral delivery systems and controlled conditions.

It’s also important to remember our bodies are exposed to foreign DNA constantly, through food, bacteria and even our own microbiome. Our immune system routinely digests and disposes of this material without incorporating it into our genome.

This question has been extensively studied over decades. Multiple health authorities, including Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration, have addressed the misinformation regarding perceived harm from residual DNA in vaccines.

Ultimately, the idea that fragmented DNA in a vaccine could cause genetic harm is false.

**The bottom line**

Despite what Kennedy would have you believe, there’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine, and the trace amounts of DNA fragments that may remain pose no health risk.

What the evidence does show, however, is that vaccines like the MMR vaccine offer excellent protection against deadly and preventable diseases, and have saved millions of lives around the world.",1kczpaw,https://theconversation.com/the-mmr-vaccine-doesnt-contain-aborted-fetus-debris-as-rfk-jr-has-claimed-heres-the-science-255718,648

A total of 935 cases have been confirmed in 29 states including Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

At least six states including Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas are reporting outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases.

The CDC says 13% of measles patients in the U.S. this year have been hospitalized, the majority of whom are under age 19.

Among the nationally confirmed cases, CDC says about 96% are among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.

Meanwhile, 2% are among those who have received just one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.

Dr. Conrad Fischer, chief of infectious diseases at One Brooklyn Health in New York City, told ABC News he is concerned about the growing number of cases in the U.S.

""This is a disease that was at the level of complete eradication; this should not be happening,"" he said. ""It's very sad to have an enormously safe vaccine that has been used in billions of people and to have a sort of cultural societal amnesia about what these illnesses were like in the past.""

In the decade before the measles vaccine became available, the CDC estimates that 3 to 4 million in the U.S. were sickened by measles every year, about 48,000 were hospitalized and about 400 to 500 people died. About 1,000 people suffered encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain. [...] 

Meanwhile, officials in Denton County -- in the eastern part of the state outside Dallas and Fort Worth -- reported its first measles case this week in a patient who attended a Texas Rangers game.

The infected individual, an adult with unknown vaccination status, visited Globe Life Field and a handful of restaurants and other locations, Denton officials said.

Additionally, Chicago reported its first measles cases this week, one in a suburban Cook County resident with unknown vaccination status and another in an adult Chicago resident who traveled internationally and received one dose of the MMR vaccine, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health and Cook County Department of Public Health.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746204665.0,"CDC reports 216 child deaths this flu season, the most in 15 years","NEW YORK (AP) — More U.S. children have died this flu season than at any time since the swine flu pandemic 15 years ago, according to a federal report released Friday.

The 216 pediatric deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eclipse the 207 reported last year. It’s the most since the 2009-2010 H1N1 global flu pandemic.

It’s a startlingly high number, given that the flu season is still going on. The final pediatric death tally for the 2023-2024 flu season wasn’t counted until autumn.

“This number that we have now is almost certainly an undercount, and one that — when the season is declared over, and they compile all the data — it’s almost certain to go up,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

There are likely several contributors to this season’s severity, but a big one is that fewer children are getting flu shots, added O’Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.

The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.

Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O’Leary said.

The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as “ highly severe,” and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.

CDC officials have information about underlying conditions on nearly 5,200 adults who were hospitalized with flu this season, and 95% had at least one existing health problem. But among 2,000 hospitalized children with more detailed health information, only about 53% had an underlying condition — including asthma and obesity.

The CDC report did not say how many of the children who died were vaccinated. The agency did not make an expert available to talk about the flu season.

The good news is that flu indicators have been waning since February, and last week all 50 states were reporting low or minimal flu activity.

The season has seen more of a mix of flu strain circulating than in many other years, with two different Type A strains — H1N1 and H3N2 — causing a lot of infections. But CDC data released earlier this year suggested flu shots were doing a pretty good job at preventing deaths and hospitalizations.

The CDC continues to recommend that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine.

Childhood vaccinations in general have been declining, driven by online misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also echoed some of the rhetoric of antivaccine activists since taking over as the nation’s health secretary.

But there may be other reasons fewer children got flu shots this year, O’Leary said.

Many pediatricians offices are understaffed and are not holding as many after-hours vaccination clinics as in the past. Also, more Americans are getting their vaccinations at pharmacies, but some drugstores don’t vaccinate children, he said.

”My hope is that this season will be a bit of wake up call for folks that we actually do need to vaccinate our kids against influenza,” O’Leary said.",1kd5sy7,https://apnews.com/article/flu-deaths-children-cdc-e79b1e4169d629ad4bc1095d95d82110,140
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746204936.0,Trump’s Budget Calls for Deep Cuts to Public Health Programs and Research,"Two of President Trump’s favorite targets — the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — will have their funding cut nearly in half under Mr. Trump’s proposed budget, which also wipes out a $4.1 billion program that helps low-income Americans pay their heating and cooling bills.

The budget blueprint, released Friday, advances, in hard numbers and biting words, Mr. Trump’s assault on the nation’s universities and scientific research enterprise. It calls the N.I.H., the world’s premier biomedical research agency, “too big and unfocused,” and proposes to cut its funding to $27 billion from roughly $48 billion — a stark contrast from its heyday in the 1990s, when Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill agreed to double its budget over a period of five years.

“NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health,” the budget document declares.

It goes on to effectively accuse the institutes of funding research that led to the coronavirus pandemic, and says the N.I.H. has “also promoted radical gender ideology to the detriment of America’s youth.”

Funding for the C.D.C., whose mission has expanded greatly over the past several decades, would drop to $4 billion from about $9 billion under the proposed budget, which eliminates entire divisions of the agency, including programs devoted to chronic disease prevention; injury prevention, including those from guns; environmental health; and global health and public health preparedness.

The budget says those programs are either duplicative, focused on diversity equity and inclusion, or “simply unnecessary.”

While chronic disease and injuries are now major causes of death in the United States, **the C.D.C.’s scope would be narrowed, and would return to its original mission of protecting Americans against infectious disease.**

The budget outline also calls for the elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program — labeling it “unnecessary” because Mr. Trump is planning to increase domestic oil and gas production and reduce energy prices.

The Government Accountability Office has raised significant integrity concerns related to fraud and abuse in the program, but it currently helps 6.2 million Americans from Texas to Maine offset their high utility bills. Last month, the administration fired everyone working in the office that administers the program.

Additionally, the budget proposes to cut more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which directs funds and support nationwide to address two of the country’s biggest public health crises.

While Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a recovering heroin addict, has said he is concerned in particular about the opioid epidemic, the budget rails against the public health strategy known as “harm reduction,” which was supported by the Biden administration and involves decreasing the risk of deaths and overdoses by ensuring that people who use illicit substances can do so safely.

It specifically criticizes “safe smoking kits” and “syringes.”

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1746140311.0,"RFK Jr. asks CDC for new treatment guidance for measles and other diseases using drugs, vitamins “and other modalities” not proven to work (so much for gold-standard science)","By Alexander Tin

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop new guidance for treating measles with drugs and vitamins, an HHS spokesperson said.

The move comes as Kennedy has faced criticism during this year's record measles outbreaks for remarks misleading people into thinking that measles infections are easily curable and inflating myths about measles vaccines. Vaccination is the only way to prevent the highly infectious disease that can cause serious health complications or death in some cases.

""Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,"" the HHS spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.

The statement said the CDC effort would involve working with universities ""to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.""

While the CDC is continuing to recommend vaccination ""as the most effective way to prevent the disease,"" the statement says they recognize some Americans ""may choose not to vaccinate.""

""Our commitment is to support all families — regardless of their vaccination status — in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles,"" the statement said.

Kennedy hinted at the plans on Tuesday, telling reporters that there were ""many, many good ways to treat measles and doctors need to know that and to know those methods."" 

""We are developing now a worksheet for doctors to address the epidemic, to address people who have it, not just with vaccination, but actually with budesonide, with clarithromycin, with vitamin A and many, many other treatments that have been shown very effective,"" Kennedy said in Texas, according to a video published by local television station WFAA.

The CDC did publish a fact sheet on Thursday for doctors treating measles, saying that other treatments ""such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.""

**Budesonide and clarithromycin**

For weeks, Kennedy has praised the use of the drugs budesonide and clarithromycin for treating measles, claiming ""miraculous and instantaneous recovery"" for some patients despite scant evidence for the recommendation.

Anecdotal claims about success using the drugs stem from two Texas doctors — Dr. Ben Edwards and Dr. Richard Bartlett — whom Kennedy says he spoke with. 

Experts have criticized Edwards for his approach for treating children in the outbreak, including interacting with patients and their families while he was sick with the highly contagious virus. Bartlett previously was criticized for the unfounded claim that budesonide was a ""silver bullet"" for treating COVID-19.

""There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It's misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,"" the American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, said last month of the claim.

Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the AAP committee that develops recommendations for doctors treating measles and other infectious diseases, told CBS News earlier this year that the drugs can sometimes help hospitals treat severe complications of measles.

While budesonide can help with lung inflammation and clarithromycin can fight off co-infections from other germs, Campbell cautioned that neither were antivirals for fighting the measles virus infection itself. He said decisions to use these drugs were best left up to doctors managing measles hospitalizations on an individual basis.

""In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the U.S. because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,"" Campbell had said in an email.

**Vitamin A**

Kennedy's request for the CDC comes days after the agency stepped up its warning against overuse of vitamin A, which does not cure measles infections but can be useful for reducing the risk of severe illness. High levels of vitamin A can be toxic.

""Vitamin A does not prevent measles and is not a substitute for vaccination. Consistent with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, vitamin A may be administered to infants and children in the United States with measles under the supervision of a healthcare provider as part of supportive management,"" the CDC said in updated guidance for doctors last month.

The agency cautioned that giving too much vitamin A to children could lead to toxicity ""and cause damage to the liver, bones, central nervous system, and skin.""

A total of two doses of vitamin A are recommended for doctors to prescribe under the agency's guidance, at specific doses depending on the age of the patient.

This is different from the unfounded approach touted by Kennedy to use cod liver oil to treat measles in children, which the AAP says can be dangerous.

""It has high amounts of vitamin A, much higher than the recommended daily amounts. It also can make kids sick if they take too much. In addition to vitamin A, cod liver oil is high in vitamin D — another nutrient that can be harmful if kids take more than the recommended daily amount,"" the association says.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746131873.0,US to develop universal vaccines to target multiple virus strains,"May 1 (Reuters) - The United States is investing $500 million in a vaccine project, with the goal of making ""universal"" vaccines that protect against multiple strains of a virus at once, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing emails.

The project involves producing vaccines from chemically inactivated whole viruses, reminiscent of how flu vaccines were made decades ago, WSJ said.

The move is part of what the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calls 'Generation Gold Standard', a universal-vaccine technology that represents a shift in funding from COVID-19 projects to studies of more viruses, the paper reported.

The project also includes research on a second universal flu vaccine and universal coronavirus vaccines, according to a HHS statement to the WSJ.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr would require all new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, The Washington Post reported late Wednesday.

Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, is well known as a vaccine sceptic and founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, which has sued in state and federal courts over common inoculations, including measles.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1746137958.0,WSJ: RFK Jr. Bets $500 Million on Universal Vaccines in Shift From Covid-19 Funding,"The influx of cash comes as the nation’s health agencies cut grants, staff and budgets

May 1, 2025 1:48 am ET

In a shift away from next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, the Trump administration is investing $500 million in a vaccine project championed by two scientists who were recently tapped to serve in senior roles within the National Institutes of Health, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. 

The unusually large sum comes as the nation’s health agencies are cutting budgets, shrinking staff and terminating hundreds of active research grants. 

-**The project involves producing vaccines from chemically inactivated whole viruses, a throwback to how flu vaccines were made decades ago**. The goal, one that scientists have chased unsuccessfully for decades, is to make “universal” vaccines that protect against multiple strains of a virus at once.

The move is part of what the Department of Health and Human Services is calling Generation Gold Standard, a universal-vaccine technology that officials said represents a shift in funding from Covid-19 projects to studies of more viruses.

In a statement, HHS promised, without citing specific evidence, that the platform could adapt to fight RSV, among other pathogens.

The shift appears to be a makeover of the Biden administration’s Project NextGen, a $5 billion effort to fund new Covid-19 vaccines that HHS called “wasteful.” Several of the projects within NextGen received stop-work orders in recent weeks.

The Generation Gold Standard project includes research on a “universal” flu vaccine co-developed by Dr. Matthew Memoli, who was handpicked by the Trump administration this year as acting director of NIH and now serves as its principal deputy director, and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, who was selected in April to be acting director of NIH’s sprawling infectious diseases institute.

**In 2021, Memoli opposed mandatory Covid-19 vaccination with shots available at the time and declined to be vaccinated.** 

The project also includes research on a second universal flu vaccine and universal coronavirus vaccines, according to the HHS statement. HHS aims to begin trials of universal coronavirus vaccines by 2026, “with FDA approval targeted for 2029,” HHS officials said in the statement.   

“Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement.

**Universal flu vaccines—aimed to protect against novel flu strains that could spur a pandemic and, potentially, seasonal flu viruses—have for decades been a goal of scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci. But no one has succeeded.**

The primary vaccine that is part of Generation Gold Standard, BPL-1357, has so far completed one preliminary safety trial with 45 participants. An HHS official said further trials are under development. The other vaccine, BPL-24910, has been tested for toxicity, according to a contract issued by HHS, but didn’t appear to have any clinical trials listed in a national registry.

**BPL-1357 is a universal flu vaccine that consists of four types of inactivated flu viruses.** The whole-virus cocktail is delivered in the nose or by injection. Memoli and Taubenberger, who are senior scientists on the preliminary safety study, recorded mild side effects including fever, headaches and pain at the injection site.  

“It isn’t a eureka moment in terms of approaches,” said Dr. Arnold Monto, co-director of the Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. He said he would need more data to know how this ranks among a multitude of other universal flu vaccine candidates. “It’s going back to the way certain vaccines were produced in the past.”  

Whole-virus vaccines can be produced quickly, which makes them potentially useful in a pandemic context, Monto said. They also provoke a good immune response from the body. However **the trade-off is that they more frequently produce mild side effects such as pain from the jab and fever, particularly in children, and were largely abandoned decades ago.**

The main flu vaccines for adults today contain synthetic viral proteins or pieces of viruses that produce those mild side effects less frequently.

The money is to come from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or Barda, a center within the HHS that funds measures to protect the public from threats such as pandemics.

Former and current HHS officials, who requested anonymity, told the Journal they are startled by the size of the award.  
NIH labs are typically funded by their respective institutes with money appropriated by Congress. For fiscal year 2023, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where Memoli and Taubenberger conduct their research, had $856 million budgeted for more than 120 staff scientists.

A $500 million transfer “seems like an astronomical number,” said Rick Bright, a flu vaccine expert and former Barda director who left in 2020 after clashing with HHS leadership. 

Before becoming health secretary, Kennedy in public comments and on social media accused NIH-funded scientists of profiting off inventions and promised to rid health agencies of conflicts of interest. HHS said in a statement that the universal platform is fully government owned and thus free “from commercial conflicts of interest.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746069110.0,"Tuberculosis, the world’s deadliest disease, could be America’s next outbreak","Earlier this month, a high school student in Joliet, Ill. tested positive for a highly contagious disease that has claimed more lives than any other throughout human history.  

Many mistakenly believe this pathogen was eradicated decades ago. It not only still exists but is thriving, especially in some of the poorest countries around the world. The ability to monitor this disease, save lives and protect the health of Americans grows weaker by the day as the U.S. deprioritizes international funding to combat it. 

It’s tuberculosis. Since its diagnosis in 1882, it’s killed more than a billion people — more than malaria, HIV/AIDS, smallpox, influenza, cholera and the plague combined.  

Tuberculosis has taken the lives of notable figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, George Orwell, Frederic Chopin and Charles IX, among others. And it’s still being transmitted in astonishing numbers today. 

Over 1 million people worldwide died from TB in 2023. Ten million had active symptoms the same year, including nearly 10,000 Americans, a number that’s been climbing steadily since the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates nearly 13 million people in the U.S. have “latent TB infection.” Up to 10 percent will develop active TB if they aren’t treated.   


Despite TB’s existence for over 4,000 years, there’s still much we don’t know about it.  

In his book “Everything is Tuberculosis,” author John Green gives a vivid account of the unpredictable way patients in poor countries react to TB infection. Some who are untreated or mistreated die within a few months; it kills others slowly, subjecting them to years of unspeakable pain and suffering.  

Tuberculosis can also remain dormant for decades, even across a person’s entire lifetime.  

A vaccine for TB provides some protection for infants and children, but is less effective for adults and adolescents. Leaders of every Western nation should question their priorities when, after a century-and-a-half, we still don’t have a modern vaccine that can prevent infection from the world’s largest pathogenic killer.  

Green’s book chronicles the inherent challenges that poor countries, where transmission rates are disproportionately higher, face in fighting the disease.  

These include widespread drug resistance to TB treatment, as patients are often prescribed the wrong drug regimen to treat their symptoms over and over again. Others stop taking their prescriptions altogether once they begin to feel better, which, akin to antibiotics, can lead to drug efficacy intolerance and the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 

Additional factors, including deficiencies in early TB detection, which increase rates of disease transmission, and malnutrition, promote the disease’s unabated spread in densely populated areas. 

Successful therapies to fight tuberculosis have been available for nearly 75 years, yet it remains the deadliest infectious disease around the globe. Over 150 million people have died since a cure has been found. Why? 

Underinvestment in health care systems and limited access to treatment and services are to blame. Many countries simply don’t have the resources to cover the cost of proven treatments or the type of accurate testing that can diagnose TB early. And most patients who live in those countries can’t afford the drugs or the transportation required to receive medical services far from home.  

Despite these challenges, global efforts to prevent, treat and test for tuberculosis in regions with high rates of infection have helped to save nearly 80 million lives over the past 20 years. Historically, the U.S. has been a major backer of these endeavors,  contributing nearly half of all international support in 2024 alone.  

Now, the U.S. is backing away from this commitment.  

Cuts at USAID have halted TB diagnosis, service and treatment support around the world. The U.S. has also withdrawn from the World Health Organization, impacting the ability to track and monitor its worldwide spread in real time.  

What’s more, a major U.S. program to combat tuberculosis that launched in 2023 is now in jeopardy due to delays in reauthorizing the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief while thousands of federal workers are being let go at U.S. health agencies. Important TB vaccine research at the National Institutes of Health is at risk of being suspended, too.    

We should be investing in active monitoring, research and services, not decreasing or eliminating funding for tuberculosis control and treatment. If we pull away, it will fuel the spread of tuberculosis around the world and increase America’s exposure to infection.  

As cases of measles — which the U.S. eliminated back in 2000 — rise across America, we should be mindful that other diseases, like tuberculosis, are lurking around the corner.    

And our best shot at defeating them is to continue supporting measures to stop their transmission, both here at home and abroad.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746108755.0,The Brainwashing Campaign That Is Measles Misinformation,"A long-running nationwide brainwashing campaign, conducted in plain sight, now comes to its deadly culmination. The predictable consequence—reviving a preventable childhood disease in the U.S.—is at hand.

With two children dead in Texas, an adult dead in New Mexico and nearly 900 confirmed cases of measles across 25 states, we are now at risk of a preventable, dangerous disease becoming endemic once more within a generation. A terrifically infectious disease, measles requires roughly 95 percent of people being vaccinated to stop its spread, and the U.S. has been below that since 2022.

Why is this happening? An April poll on measles beliefs from the health policy-centered Kaiser Family Foundation tells us. One quarter of the 1,380 people surveyed believe the false notion that the measles vaccine causes autism. Some 19 percent mistakenly believe the vaccine is more dangerous than the deadly virus it prevents. That’s simply untrue.

This is a shameful, mass propaganda campaign, unfolding in real time, championed by our top health official, a lawyer who recently announced a pointless study into the causes of autism. This propaganda exercise, headed by an unqualified anti-vaxxer, was conjured simply to raise questions about vaccines. The poll makes clear who this noise is aimed at: Republican voters, bidding to undermine their trust in science and government in ways familiar since COVID.

We are on the brink of an epidemic, one that could make millions of people sick with measles each year, and this is all being done for political and personal gain, with children as the collateral damage.

The tanning-booth cabal broadcasting this nonsense has helped one in three U.S. adults report they have now heard the falsehood that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than the disease, almost twice as many as said the same a year earlier. And people who identify as Republican are eating this up.

“We see that trust overall has fallen, but that’s really been driven by declining trust in government sources of health information among Republicans,” says Liz Hamel, vice president and director of public opinion and survey research at KFF. “And that’s whether you ask the question about information on COVID-19, or information on vaccines, or just to make the right recommendations on health care.”

Why undermine public trust in health recommendations? It’s good politics, Trump and his supporters have found, aimed at driving the country back to the gilded age. Public health, ensuring safe drugs and food, are public goods largely directed by federal agencies. If your goal is dismantling the federal government, making people think those (admittedly far-from-perfect) health agencies are lying about vaccines is a great place to start undoing the progressive era.

[...] 

Why pretend there isn’t a political brainwashing experiment going on? The Trump administration’s loudest voice on vaccines is (somehow) HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who after tepidly endorsing the MMR shot in the Texas outbreak (“stoking fury among his supporters,” according to NPR), pivoted to doubting their safety and embraced a Texas doctor who treated kids while reportedly ill with measles. His autism study move seems aimed at scaring parents into not vaccinating their kids by laundering the bogus link back to the syndrome into the news.

None of this is subtle. An April Journal for the Anthropology of North America study, looking at distrust for the government among Evangelical Christians in Oregon, nicely lays out how these kinds of views were transmitted to Republican voters in the COVID pandemic. “[I]ndividuals we met invoked well-worn and pervasive far-right and/or Christian conspiracy theories promulgated by right-wing media,” found the anthropologists.

A pastor counseled people to eschew vaccines out of Christian duty to demonstrate faith in God. A career nurse “read reports of how the COVID-19 vaccine made people sicker than the virus itself,” and stopped endorsing vaccines for kids. To some, “the COVID-19 vaccine symbolized everything wrong and threatening” about “big government” and “big medicine,” the study in Oregon found.

Such conspiratorial thinking is now standard stuff in our politics. Ever since President Donald Trump first botched the handling of COVID in 2020, when his administration fumbled the rollout of vaccines, the Republican Party has turned against inoculations. Partly, this turn against science was meant to inoculate Trump from the political cost of raising hopes of the pandemic ending “by Easter” in its first year. The subsequent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 cases ahead of the 2020 election led to attacks on then NIAID chief Anthony Fauci as a political scapegoating strategy.

In 2024 Trump brought RFK, Jr. (whom he once accused of being a “fake” anti-vaxxer) onto his campaign precisely for his anti–medical establishment credentials. Kennedy’s views, steadily peddled on right-wing outlets, attracted measles-vaccine-doubting voters. It was a classic case of “If you can’t beat ’em on lying about vaccines, give him control of the nation’s public health apparatus.”

The propaganda is effective enough that the parents of one girl who died of measles in Texas told the rabidly anti-vax group Children’s Health Defense (which was founded and until recently chaired by RFK, Jr.) that they still opposed vaccinations even after this preventable tragedy. In stomach-turning fashion, the group turned the family’s statements into a propaganda video against vaccines.

For the politicians and the grifters who pump out this dangerous dishonesty, these deaths don’t matter, so long as they get the votes. For everyone else, the deadly spread of measles is the dismal future they now promise our kids.",1kc9qf9,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/measles-vaccine-denial-is-a-massive-brainwashing-campaign/,89
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746052079.0,RFK Jr.'s HHS Orders Lab Studying Deadly Infectious Diseases to Stop Research,"A research facility within the US National Institutes of Health that is tasked with studying Ebola and other deadly infectious diseases has been instructed by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to stop research activities.

According to an email viewed by WIRED, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was told to stop all experimental work by April 29 at 5 pm. The facility is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is located at the US Army base Fort Detrick. It conducts research on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that are deemed “high consequence”—those that pose significant risks to public health. It has 168 employees, including federal workers and contractors.

The email, sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, says the lab is terminating studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare but lethal mosquito-borne disease that has been reported in several Northern US states. “We are collecting as many samples as is reasonable to ensure these studies are of value,” he says in the email. “We have not been asked to euthanize any animals so these animals will continue to be managed.” Holbrook did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.

The email says representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were padlocking freezers in BSL-4 labs, those with the highest level of biosafety containment used for studying highly dangerous microbes. Only about a dozen BSL-4 labs exist in North America. These labs work with the viruses that cause Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg, types of hemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Research Facility is one of few places in the world that is able to perform medical imaging on animals infected with BSL-4 agents.

“The sacrifice to research is immense,” says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, on the closure. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”
The facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, has also been placed on administrative leave, according to the email. Previously, Schmaljohn served as a senior research scientist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. She has more than 200 research publications and her work has led to several clinical trials of first-of-their kind vaccines. Schmaljohn also did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.

In an emailed statement provided to WIRED, Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, confirmed the halt in research activity. “NIH has implemented a research pause—referred to as a safety stand-down—at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause. During the stand-down, no research will be conducted, and access will be limited to essential personnel only, to safeguard the facility and its resources.”

Moss did not elaborate on the nature of the personnel issues, and said he did not know how long the research pause would last. Staff have not received an anticipated reopening date. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746132434.0,Ontario sees sharpest rise in measles yet with 223 new infections since last week,"
TORONTO — Ontario is reporting its highest increase in measles cases since its outbreak began, with 223 new infections in the province over the past week.

That brings the total number of people in the province who have fallen ill from the virus to 1,243 since October. 

Public Health Ontario said in a report today that 84 people have been hospitalized – including 63 children – during the course of this outbreak. Eight patients have been admitted to intensive care.

The agency notes that its southwestern public health unit has had 57 new infections, compared to 15 the previous week. Neighbouring Grand Erie Public Health is also seeing an uptick with 46 cases, compared to two the previous week.

Southwestern Public Health Unit’s Dr. Ninh Tran said this “sharp rise” is due to exposures in large unvaccinated households between siblings and other family members, and places where unimmunized people gather.

He said the increase in cases is not tied to any “particular singular” event, but rather, it’s due to a group of cases linked to one another. However, he did not pin the spread to a particular group.

Tran said the duration of hospital stays on average is usually just over three days, and ranges from about one to 11 days. 

Alberta reported 170 measles cases Wednesday – including nine hospitalizations – since its outbreak began in March.

Alberta Medical Association president Dr. Shelley Duggan told The Canadian Press last week the numbers suggest that within weeks, that count could skyrocket to more than 1,000, like in Ontario",1kcj78a,https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/05/01/ontario-sees-sharpest-rise-in-measles-yet-with-223-new-infections-since-last-week/,7

The potential change outlined in a statement would require all new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, sparking concerns among medical experts.

Rachel Roubein, 
April 30, 2025 at 7:55 p.m. EDTToday at 7:55 p.m. EDT

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to shift the way vaccines are tested, a move that the agency said will increase transparency but that medical experts fear could limit access to vaccines and undermine the public’s trust in immunization depending on its implementation.

The potential change outlined in a statement says all new vaccines will be required to undergo placebo testing, a procedure in which some people receive the vaccine and others receive an inert substance — such as a saline shot — before the results are compared.

“All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure — a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told The Washington Post in response to questions about Kennedy’s comments on the measles vaccines and general vaccine policy.

Vaccines for new pathogens are often tested this way. But for well-researched diseases, such as measles and polio, public health experts say it makes little sense to do that and can be unethical, because the placebo group would not receive a known effective intervention.

HHS did not clarify how the change will be implemented and for which vaccines the testing would apply, nor did it define what the department meant by “new vaccine.” But the government indicated it wouldn’t apply to the flu vaccine, which is updated year to year and which HHS stated “has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.” In response to questions about whether other vaccines previously safety tested would be newly scrutinized, the department focused on its concerns around the coronavirus vaccine but did not address other immunizations.

Kennedy has long disparaged vaccines, said they are not adequately safety tested and previously called for placebo testing for vaccines that are approved for use.

“Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” HHS said in a statement.

The HHS statement raised concerns among medical and public health experts who said the move could be a significant shift in how the country has ensured the safety of vaccines for decades, as well as cast doubt on vaccines that are safe, effective and key to public health. The potential change comes as public trust in vaccines continues to decline amid a growing measles outbreak and worries over Kennedy’s mixed messaging about immunizations.

Medical and public health experts also expressed dismay that the testing change could require coronavirus vaccines, and potentially others, to undergo costly and, in their view, unnecessary studies that would probably limit vaccine production and access — and leave more Americans at risk of preventable disease.

“You are watching the gradual dissolution of the vaccine infrastructure in this country,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The goal is to make vaccines less available and less affordable.”

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has injected uncertainty into the annual process for approving an updated coronavirus shot traditionally offered in the fall, indicating there may need to be more data.

“Except for the COVID vaccine, none of the vaccines on the CDC’s childhood recommended schedule was tested against an inert placebo, meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products,” HHS said in its statement.

Vaccine and public health experts said the statement from HHS is a combination of misinformation and exaggeration or misrepresentation of scientific studies.

“To make a blanket statement like that, I think that would go against the science,” said Sean O’Leary, a pediatric-infectious-diseases physician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases.

The move came as Kennedy urged parents this week to “do your own research” and said that “making sure the vaccines are safe” is one of his top priorities, during an interview with Phil McGraw, who is known as Dr. Phil.

Since Kennedy became HHS secretary, the department has appointed a vaccine skeptic to investigate the debunked link between vaccination and autism. Peter Marks, the nation’s top vaccine regulator, resigned under pressure. And Kennedy has not spoken as forcefully for vaccination amid an ongoing measles outbreak as the first Trump administration did.

The HHS statement and others from Kennedy casting doubt on vaccine safety are part of his long-running effort to decrease confidence in immunizations, said David Gorski, a Wayne State University School of Medicine professor of surgery and oncology and managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, which debunks misinformation in medicine.

“Instead of just an anti-vaccine activist … saying this stuff, now the federal government, HHS and FDA is now saying this stuff. That matters,” he said.

**Undermines real transparency**

Kennedy has previously claimed that vaccine testing studies are not long enough to capture potential safety issues, although vaccines are continuously and rigorously monitored.

“A lot of the injuries that come from medication are autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years,” Kennedy said in a 2021 interview. Waiting to conduct a multiyear study as per Kennedy’s suggestion would slow the development of vaccines and their release.

Now as head of HHS, Kennedy has said he wants to restore “gold standard” science to the federal health agencies and look at the data.

“HHS is now building surveillance systems that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits — because real science demands both transparency and accountability,” an HHS spokesperson told The Post.

Medical experts dismissed the idea that a new system was needed, saying the current system adequately tracks adverse events associated with vaccines.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) received a list of commitments from Kennedy before voting to confirm the secretary. That included a commitment to work within the “current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems” and giving a 30-day notice to the Senate health committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any federal vaccine safety monitoring programs, Cassidy said in a Feb. 4 speech on the Senate floor.

“Claiming vaccines have risks the data doesn’t show or trying to overstate vaccine risks is not transparency,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco who tracks public health vaccine law. “It’s misinformation, and it undermines real transparency and informed consent.”

Additionally, many vaccines have been tested against placebos, the experts said. And while HHS said the trials would be for “new vaccines,” if Kennedy tries to test vaccines that have already been approved, such as the measles vaccine, against a placebo, that would mean in practice some children would not get vaccinated against the infectious disease while their neighbors did — a quandary that physicians say leaves them susceptible to diseases when there is a vaccine that works.

Stanley Plotkin, a pioneer in the field who developed the rubella vaccine, said that when scientists test vaccines against a new disease, they typically look for evidence that the vaccinated individuals do not get a disease, compared with those who received a placebo. This is how the coronavirus vaccines were tested, in 30,000-person trials in which half of the participants received saline shots.

But when a disease is already well understood, scientists can look for evidence that vaccines induce a biological response that has been scientifically shown to protect against the disease — what scientists call “a correlate of protection.”

In the case of diseases that cause serious illness and can even be fatal, if there are existing interventions, the use of placebos is often not considered ethical.

“Ethics must be taken into account when you set up a study,” Plotkin said. “Can I ethically agree to having people acquire the disease because they receive a placebo?”

**Coronavirus vaccine in play?**

The administration has taken aim at reexamining the coronavirus vaccine.

When asked by CBS News on Tuesday whether the Food and Drug Administration plans to green-light updates to the coronavirus shots, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency was “taking a look.”

“We have a bit of a public trust problem,” Makary said. “I think there’s a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I’d like to see some good data.”

In a statement, HHS affirmed Makary’s comments: “Using the COVID pandemic as an eternal justification for blanket approvals of new products will not happen under the leadership of Commissioner Makary.”

**Additionally, the Trump administration is seeking for the drug manufacturer Novavax to commit to conducting a new clinical trial on its coronavirus vaccine after it gets approved**. The company’s shot has been available under emergency use authorization and is the only vaccine that uses a more traditional protein base instead of messenger RNA — an appealing option to some who have reactions to mRNA shots.

The FDA was on track to grant full approval to the vaccine April 1, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Top Trump FDA officials told agency regulators to pause the approval, these sources said — which some vaccine experts say amounts to political interference into decisions typically made by career staff tasked with reviewing the data.

“To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies,” Makary wrote Saturday in a post on X. Several vaccine experts dismiss the notion that the vaccine constitutes a new product.

Such a move would be costly and suggests a potential shift in how the agency may approach coronavirus vaccines going forward. **Typically, Pfizer and Moderna get instructions from the FDA on how to update their vaccines in June. It’s unclear whether they will need to run new clinical trials for their vaccines, which would be unlikely to occur before the annual coronavirus shot in the fall.**

“While we cannot comment on this specifically, we look forward to continued collaboration with the Administration and teams across HHS,” said Chris Ridley, a spokesman for Moderna.

Medical experts The Post spoke to predicted that the change by Kennedy could limit new vaccines approved under his watch, as well as slow investment by pharmaceutical companies. Ultimately, that would result in fewer vaccines available.

“It’s just not correct. They obviously don’t understand how vaccines are approved and how one obtains safety data,” said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert who advised President Joe Biden’s transition team, adding that the change threatened the existence of coronavirus vaccines.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1746049027.0,"Long COVID has unique symptoms, persistence not seen in flu, pneumonia, research suggests","Post-COVID symptoms, prevalence, and time to resolution are different from those seen after flu or pneumonia, better characterizing long COVID, University of Texas investigators say.

The study team analyzed health claims data from Medicare Advantage–covered and commercially insured US adults diagnosed as having symptomatic COVID-19 in 2020 (121,205 patients) and similar groups with flu (20,844) and pneumonia (29,052) diagnosed before the pandemic. Symptoms were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months after post-diagnosis.

The findings were published yesterday in PLOS One.

**Over time, only most severe cases still caused symptoms**

After 1, 3, and 6 months post-diagnosis, the odds ratios [ORs] of any symptom in the flu cohort relative to the COVID-19 group were 0.77, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively. In contrast, the respective ORs among pneumonia patients were 2.24, 2.41, and 2.46, meaning more than double the risk at those points in time.

The most common symptoms persisting beyond 4 weeks post-infection among COVID-19 patients were fatigue (25.4%), shortness of breath (24.7%), and joint pain (24.7%). Among flu patients, the most common symptoms were joint pain (19.8%), fatigue (18.2%), and cough (17.7%). In the pneumonia group, shortness of breath (42.2%), fatigue (34.8%), and cough (33.9%) were noted most often.

The odds of having any symptom didn't differ significantly between illness severity levels 4 and 3, but the ORs for severity levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 were 1.12, 1.16, 1.46, and 2.64 times those for severity level 3, respectively. 

With increasing time since diagnosis, only the most severe infections (severity levels 7 and 8) continued to cause symptoms. For level 7, the OR of having a symptom versus level 3 was 1.19 and 1.10 after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Likewise, the level-8 OR was 1.84 and 1.53 at the same time points. 

Underlying medical conditions resulted in higher odds for all time points and comorbidities. The chronic conditions with the greatest increased odds of symptoms after 4 weeks were rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 2.15), ischemic heart disease (OR, 1.80), and asthma (OR, 1.80).

**Magnitude of odds waned, but trend persisted**
Overall, relative to patients aged 80 and older, the odds of any symptom after 4 weeks were lower for all age-groups except for 70 to 79 years, which was not statistically different.

After controlling for demographic factors and chronic conditions, the likelihood of a diagnosis of anxiety, brain fog, fatigue, and shortness of breath after 1, 3, and 6 months rose along with COVID-19 severity. The probability of fatigue for severity level 8 after 4 weeks was 3.32 times that for level 3, and the OR of shortness of breath was 3.07. Over time, the magnitude of ORs ebbed but maintained the trend. 

The northeastern United States saw the highest rates of all lingering COVID-19 symptoms, except for headache, for which it had the lowest rates. White patients were more likely to have anxiety or fatigue than their Asian, Black, and Hispanic peers. Hispanic patients were the least likely to have persistent abnormal heart rhythms, brain fog, and shortness of breath.

""We found that COVID-19 symptomology could not be perfectly described by previously seen influenza or pneumonia symptomology,"" the study authors concluded.

**Fibrin and blood clotting**

We’ve known for a while that fibrin plays a role in acute severe disease and long COVID—but not how this worked. 

The **SARS-CoV-2 virus “hijacks the clotting system for its own purpose,”** with recent research showing its spike protein binds to fibrin, turning it into a “toxic form,” Professor Crabb says. 

The activated toxic form of fibrin lays down deposits on blood vessel walls, he explains, driving a “big inflammatory response” that causes the microvascular damage responsible for neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. **It also suppresses natural killer cells.**

“So **the process, firstly, is SARS-CoV-2 specific. Other viruses don’t do this**,” he says. “And it turns out this toxic form of fibrin is the driver of inflammation, not the result of inflammation. So it’s an underlying cause.”

Kansas is among the states with cases linked to the large outbreak in West Texas. Of the total, 42 patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Most infections involve children.

One patient was hospitalized in the Kansas outbreak, but no deaths have been reported.

In Montana, Gallatin County health officials reported two more cases, raising the county's total to seven. The newly confirmed patients had household exposure to five people whose earlier illnesses were linked to out-of-state travel.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services said the two latest patients weren't vaccinated and were isolating at home when their symptoms began. No other exposure sites were identified.

The initial five cases marked Montana's first since 1990.

Elsewhere, Defiance County, Ohio, has reported a confirmed measles infection in an adult resident with an unknown vaccination status who had minimal contact with other people. In a statement, the health department said the patient has recovered.

Officials didn't say where the patient might have contracted the virus.

Jeremy Faust, MD. Apr 29, 2025

Over the weekend, I reached out to FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary to get comments for an Inside Medicine article in which current and former FDA staffers describe some concerns about recent events at the agency. That piece will be published soon. Dr. Makary—who preceded me as editor-in-chief of MedPage Today—kindly agreed to an exclusive conversation (which took place via two phone calls and follow-up emails) to address the issues raised and related topics, to provide his impressions of the early days of his tenure, and to share his vision for the agency. Some of his comments will appear in the second piece, but the entirety of Dr. Makary’s on-the-record remarks appear below.

Among other things, Dr. Makary breaks some news here by stating, for the first time, that there will be no significant reorganization at the FDA, like those proposed for other HHS agencies.

Some excerpts below. More in the linked article.

**JF: What would you like people to understand about your goals and agenda?**

MM: Things that I believe most Americans find sensible—reducing animal testing, advancing AI, removing industry members from FDA advisory committees, and taking action to remove synthetic dyes from our food supply. In my opinion, the FDA should partner with industry and make the approval process more user-friendly, efficient, and faster, but the scientific review process needs to be independent of industry. It’s one step towards rebuilding public trust. Last week, we also took action to remove eight petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply. I expect more announcements in the coming weeks.

When people ask me “what’s my agenda,” I tell them I’m focused on cures and meaningful treatments, healthier food for children, facilitating innovation, and promoting public safety. There is literally nothing political about any of these priorities. I have tremendous confidence in the many scientists, inspectors, and staff at the FDA to help accomplish these goals and am excited to work with them. My goal is to get to know as many of them as I can.

  
**JF: Insiders and outsiders are saying that they see the Novavax approval as a bellwether for your ability to run the FDA independently. Here’s what you said on Twitter in 2021:**

https://preview.redd.it/bsnuqrjf1wxe1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=068ef973737a18ad5d1a8bfffd3acc418f482a36

**Do you still believe that? Do you think Novavax is less safe or less effective than the Covid vaccines that the FDA has fully approved?**

MM: I am responsible for 100% of decisions made at the FDA. No one above me has been or will be making decisions on products. Secretary Kennedy may have strong recommendations, which he has a right to, but I make my decisions based on the two guiding principles of gold standard science and common sense. When Secretary Kennedy offers a suggestion to me, he always adds, “You decide for yourself.” So, yes, there is independence.

On the Novavax question, my views evolve with data. I have been a fan of traditional vaccine platforms for Covid, especially in 2021, when it provided another pathway for people uncomfortable with mRNA to get vaccinated. But the big Novavax 2020-2021 study excluded people with natural immunity to Covid. Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can’t give an honest evidence-based answer to that question. These are new vaccine products, not the tried-and-true flu shot that has been around for 80 years. If we had a study showing that Covid boosters help keep people out of the hospital today, it could significantly increase the low Covid vaccine uptake rate that we have today. Look, 85% of healthcare workers declined the latest Covid booster vaccine last fall. Should we accept that and just keep pounding on parents to get their healthy 12-year-old daughter a 7^(th) Covid jab this fall? Or should we make evidence-based recommendations based on a meaningful study showing a clinical benefit today?

**JF: You’re arguing that in the post-immune era (that is, when everyone has some immunity to SARS-CoV-2, by way of vaccines, infections, or both), we need new data. But what’s the difference between this and the mRNA vaccines, which** ***do*** **have full FDA approval?**

MM: I think it’s time to get back to gold standard science. The *Wall Street Journal* [headline](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trial-fda-de5d3bb3) on this topic was accurate—that the FDA asking the vaccine maker to do a clinical study for a new vaccine product could cost “tens of millions of dollars.” But my job is upholding gold standard science and rebuilding public trust, not to save pharma companies tens of millions of dollars.

**JF: Will there be a significant reorganization at FDA? If so, what might that look like in terms of center/division realignment versus elimination of activities and staff?**

MM: No. There will not be a reorganization. Yes, we are consolidating travel offices, IT, and some other things that make sense for efficiency, but nothing else is planned. A proposal for a reorganization came from some staff, but I rejected that proposal. I said that we will work within the existing structure. We are going to focus on making the FDA a great place to work. Reviewing applications is hard work. Our staff deserve a great place to work.

**JF: And nothing ever came from DOGE on this?**

MM: No, but we maintain a very collaborative relationship with DOGE. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to modernize the agency. We have a big agenda. It’s time to turn our attention to it.",1kb6i06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagionCuriosity/comments/1kb6i06/exclusive_in_conversation_with_fda_commissioner/,18

Commissioner Makary echoes Kennedy by increasing scrutiny of vaccines

Lizzy Lawrence April 29, 2025

WASHINGTON — When Marty Makary was tapped to lead the Food and Drug Administration, public health experts hoped the Johns Hopkins physician would shield the agency from the vaccine criticism of his boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 

So far, that hasn’t been the case. Instead, Makary seems just as willing to use his power and position to more harshly scrutinize vaccines and to shift vaccination policy. 

Over the weekend, he signaled that the FDA may depart from longstanding precedent by requiring Covid vaccine makers to submit new effectiveness data before adjusting their products for new strains — a regulatory hurdle that could leave people unprotected from new versions of the disease.

Plus, a lot of confusion around Novavax Covid-19 vaccine approval and a new backup plan for vaccine policy.

Here’s the much-needed context and what it may mean to you.

**Infectious Disease Alerts**


**Measles**: We’re now at 923 cases nationwide. It’s hard to determine whether we’re at the beginning or middle of these outbreaks, given significant underreporting, but we’re quickly approaching the highest number of cases recorded in the past 25 years.

For the big Texas outbreak, I’m keeping a close eye on:

El Paso: 29 cases in just 18 days.

Chihuahua, Mexico: Outbreak is surging, with 605 cases reported.

New Mexico: Signs of slowing, with fewer new cases each week.

A new KFF poll shows a stark divide in public concern: 76% of Democrats say they’re worried about the measles outbreak, compared to just 28% of Republicans.

**Dengue** (also known as breakbone fever), traditionally considered a neglected tropical disease, is creeping northward due to a warming Earth, resulting in more locally acquired cases and an increase in cases from international travel. Last year, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency. Most infections are asymptomatic, but 1 in 4 infections cause flu-like symptoms and can occasionally (1 in 20 infections) cause more severe disease like hemorrhagic fever.

This year, CDC has reported 1,568 cases—mostly from international travel and mostly in Puerto Rico. But Hawaii made news last week as they already reported 7 travel-related cases—higher than expected for this time of year:

2024: 14 total cases

Previous years: 4 cases on average

We will likely see more cases in the U.S., but for now, it remains a rare occurrence.

What does this mean to you? Risk is very low and not uniform across the States. TX, CA, FL, and PR typically see the most locally acquired cases. Prevention is simple: EPA-recommended insect repellents, especially those with DEET. They really do work. Here is a YLE deep dive on mosquito-borne illnesses in the U.S. if you’re looking for more context.

[...] 


**What’s happening with Novavax? This is a good question.**

Unlike Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, Novavax uses a more traditional protein-based platform. It has been available under emergency use authorization while working toward full FDA approval—the gold standard for maintaining market access. Manufacturing delays have slowed that process. But a lot has changed in just the past month.

Here’s what I know:

Full approval was originally scheduled for April 1, but that decision was paused—eerily, just after Dr. Peter Marks was forced to resign—sparking speculation of political interference.

Last week, Novavax announced it’s back on track for full approval.

Then, over the weekend, the FDA said that it is requiring a clinical trial to reevaluate the effectiveness of Novavax.

And now, more recent comments suggest that the same bar might be applied to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines as well.

This is… not normal. A new clinical trial could cost millions of dollars—which isn’t my main concern, given the financial position of these companies—but it would also take time, and that is a concern. Fall is around the corner, and designing, recruiting, conducting trials, and manufacturing doses typically take years—unless we’re in a declared emergency.

Since the original Covid-19 vaccine trials, we have shifted to a model similar to flu vaccines: anticipate the virus mutating quickly and test a small number of people’s blood to confirm an immune response. The strain changes in the vaccine formula are minor—more like tweaking a few letters in a Word doc than changing the document’s content, length, or format. Meanwhile, real-world data from CDC continues to show that updated Covid vaccines offer additional protection, especially for those over 65.

Here’s what I don’t know: Are these just FDA talking points to the media, or will this actually become policy for fall approval? What kind of trial is being required—tens of thousands of participants? And why are Covid-19 vaccines now being treated so differently than flu?

There’s a lot we still don’t know. And until we get clarity, it’s unclear whether updated Covid vaccines will be available this fall—or if they’ll be delayed by shifting expectations and new rules.

**The Vaccine Integrity Project: a new backup plan?**

There are concerns that Secretary Kennedy will politically influence or change ACIP—the external committee for vaccine policy in the United States—which means the possibility of changing eligibility or access to vaccines. If this happens, it will be a mess. States will be on their own, insurance companies will be looking for third-party validation, and there would be a whole lot of confusion.

So, a shadow group was stood up University of Minnesota (called the Vaccine Integrity Project) backed by a philanthropic gift. This will be an eight-member committee to advise on vaccine protection, effectiveness, and recommendations outside of government.

What does it mean for you? The Vaccine Integrity Project won’t have formal authority. However, if ACIP’s role becomes politicized, it could serve as an important alternative. It’s another sign that public health groups are mobilizing to stay ahead of potential disruptions.

In a statement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, “Although the outbreak has been declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance to rapidly identify and respond to any re-emergence. Risk communication and community engagement will also continue to ensure the community stay informed and stigma to those who were affected is minimized.”

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed one more H5N1 avian flu detection in dairy cattle, a herd from Arizona. The state has now reported three detections since the middle of February, and the latest confirmation lifts the national total since March 2024 to 1,032 detections from 17 states.

Valneva today announced that French drug regulators have updated their recommendation for the company’s chikungunya vaccine (Ixchiq) following reports of severe adverse reactions in older people with underlying health conditions who were immunized on a priority basis during the response to a large ongoing chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion and Mayotte. Officials are investigating three adverse events that required hospitalization, one of them fatal. The hospitalized patients were older than 80 years old and had preexisting conditions. In early March, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an alert, noting that it was investigating five hospitalization for cardiac and neurological events following Ixchiq vaccination in people ages 65 and older. 

Earlier this month, the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel recommended chikungunya vaccines from Valneva and Bavarian Nordic for certain at-risk groups, but added wording that being age 65 years and older is a precaution for receiving Valneva’s live-attenuated vaccine.",1kapd2s,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/quick-takes-ebola-sudan-outbreak-over-h5n1-arizona-cows-france-modifies,17
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745896650.0,California reports sharp rise in valley fever cases for first three months of 2025,"California is heading toward another record year for cases of valley fever, the disease caused by fungal spores linked to cycles of drought and precipitation.

There were 3,123 reported cases of valley fever in the first three months of the year, according to state health officials — roughly double the 10-year average for the first-quarter time period. Cases ranged from a low of 801 in 2016 to 3,011 last year.

Most people who are infected with the fungus won’t experience symptoms, and their bodies will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do suffer symptoms however are often hard-pressed to recognize them, as they resemble the onset of COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease.

The disease is caused by inhaling spores of coccidioides, a fungal pathogen that thrives in the drier and dustier regions of the state. The fungus is released when the dry soil where it grows is disturbed.

“We actually had sort of seen this coming, just based on the climate cycle of the last few years,” said George R. Thompson, a professor of medicine at the UC Davis School of Medicine and a specialist in invasive fungal infections.

Research has shown that patterns of drought and precipitation play important roles in the number of valley fever cases in California, said Doua Ge Yang, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Public Health. “When there are several years of drought in California, followed by a wet winter, and then a dry summer,” there are increases in valley fever cases for the following two years.

She said 2023 typified such a scenario, and as predicted, 2024 resulted in a record-high case count, with 12,637 cases recorded.

“Valley fever is on the rise in California,” she said.

While the numbers for 2025 are so far higher than any previously recorded first quarter, Yang said health officials can’t predict whether it will remain a record year. She also noted that all the numbers from 2024 and 2025 are considered preliminary — and therefore demographic issues such as age, sex and race cannot yet be reported.

In addition to patterns of rain and drought, research shows that other factors can play a role in incidents of valley fever — including soil disturbance, such as the kind accompanying construction activity, wild fires and even archaeological digs.

Construction workers, firefighters and archaeologists working in the dry, arid regions of the state are at increased risk of getting the disease — especially as Californians move into these previously less inhabited regions of the state.

Last year, at least 19 people who attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County, came down with the disease — including several who reported severe effects that included pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion.

[...] 

Some theorize that the widespread use of antifungal chemicals on crops in areas where the fungus is endemic may be contributing to its resistance, but research on the topic is only just getting underway and answers so far are elusive.

He said there’s a statewide effort looking into these issues, that includes participation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s public health department, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and Cal State Fresno and Cal State Bakersfield.

He said the disease for years had largely been sidelined in public health circles, as attention and funding was targeted at other pathogens that had wider and more severe impacts.

“I hate to disparage that, but I think with limited resources, public health agencies do have to really prioritize certain pathogens,” he said.",1kae9o4,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-04-25/valley-fever-cases-record-high,26

The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating. WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.

From 1 January to 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, were confirmed in the WHO Region of the Americas, an **11-fold increase compared to the 205 cases of measles reported in the same period in 2024.**The cases have been reported from six countries: Argentina (n= 21 cases), Belize (n= 2 cases), Brazil (n= 5 cases), Canada [1] (n=1069 cases), Mexico [2] (n= 421 cases including one death), and the United States of America [3] (n=800 cases, including two deaths).

[...] 

**WHO Risk Assessment**

In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.

Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases.

 Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.

The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:

Ongoing virus circulation from imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains, secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.

Suboptimal vaccination coverage persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over 95% coverage for the first MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the second dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for 2024 is still being consolidated.

An increasing number of susceptible individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare, especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons, and Indigenous populations.

The overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.

The overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. 

These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. 

This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.",1ka5576,https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565,75
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745863784.0,Malaria Remains Endemic in 83 Countries,"On World Malaria Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for revitalized efforts, from global policy to community action, to accelerate progress toward the elimination of Malaria, a serious disease.

As of April 2025, the WHO has certified 45 countries and one territory as malaria-free. Of the remaining 83 malaria-endemic countries, 25 reported fewer than 10 cases of the disease in 2023.

The WHO says, 'More than 2 billion cases of mosquito-transmitted malaria and nearly 13 million deaths have been prevented since 2000.'

However, as history has shown with diseases such as polio, these gains are fragile.

""The history of malaria teaches us a harsh lesson: when we divert our attention, the disease resurges, taking its greatest toll on the most vulnerable,"" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a media release on April 25, 2025.

""But the same history also shows us what's possible: with strong political commitment, sustained investment, multisectoral action, and community engagement, malaria can be defeated.""

The WHO highlighted two positive changes.

The expanded use of a new generation of insecticide-treated nets is poised to lower the disease burden. According to the latest World Malaria Report, these new nets, which have a greater impact against Malaria than the standard pyrethroid-only nets, accounted for nearly 80% of all nets delivered in sub-Saharan Africa in 2023, up from 59% the previous year.

Additionally, the WHO has listed two malaria vaccines and are being administered in various African countries, such as Nigeria.

As of April 28, 2025, the majority of malaria cases in the United States are attributed to travelers returning from Africa, such as in Florida.

However, the Mosquirix and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines remain unavailable in the U.S.

In lieu of vaccination, the U.S. CDC says avoiding mosquito bites and taking appropriate medications is the best way to prevent Malaria. ",1ka2c38,https://www.vax-before-travel.com/malaria-remains-endemic-83-countries-2025-04-28,15
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745762356.0,How ‘revenge of the Covid contrarians’ unleashed by RFK Jr puts broader vaccine advances at risk,"he US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, entered office with a pledge to tackle the US’s chronic disease epidemic and give infectious disease a “break”. In at least one of those goals, Kennedy has been expeditious.

Experts said as Kennedy makes major cuts in public health in his first weeks in office, the infrastructure built to mitigate Covid-19 has become a clear target – an aim that has the dual effect of weakening immunization efforts as the US endures the largest measles outbreak since 2000.

“If his goal is to undermine public health infrastructure, he’s making strides there,” said Dorit Reiss, a University of California Law School professor whose research focuses on vaccine law. “If his goal is combating chronic diseases – he’s not doing very well.”

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been characterized by upheaval since Kennedy and the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cumulatively axed 20,000 jobs – roughly a quarter of the 82,000-person workforce.

And it appears that turmoil will continue: a leaked budget memo shows the administration poised to propose a budget cut of another $40bn, or roughly one-third of the department’s discretionary spending.

Amid the cuts, attacks on Covid-19 infrastructure have proven thematic, and show the administration’s hostility toward work that once mitigated the virus. That’s included attacking promising vaccine platforms and elevating once-ostracized voices to high-level roles.

“The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a spokesperson for HHS told the Guardian in response to questions about its strategy.

“HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University associate professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, calls this strategy the “revenge of the Covid contrarians”.

“They’re not interested in the science, they’re interested in their conclusions and having the science bend to their will,” said Gonsalves. “They want to create a Potemkin village of their own making that looks like science but has nothing to do with science at all.”

Among Kennedy’s changes: attacks on the promising platform that supported Covid-19 vaccine development, delayed approval of a Covid-19 vaccine, the clawing back of grants that provided local immunization support and studied vaccine safety, and elevating one-time critics of Covid-19 policy.

“When the new administration came in, we were hearing even within the organization: ‘We can’t say Covid, we’re not allowed to say Covid,’” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho), about her members’ conversations.

Freeman noted that “we kind of saw the writing on the wall a couple months ago that: ‘OK, they really don’t want anything Covid-related to be pursued any more.’ Everything Covid-related is quite honestly at risk.” [...] 

Under Kennedy’s watch, HHS has also taken the unusual step of delaying an expected vaccine approval, reportedly under the watch of a Kennedy political appointee.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which sits under the umbrella of HHS, delayed the expected 1 April approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. Novavax confirmed to the Guardian that its application remained on hold, and said it would have “no further comments”. [...] 

An HHS spokesperson told the Guardian: “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines, is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations. Any delays are a result of scientific review, not a lack of priority. It’s important to focus on the facts rather than unfounded speculation.”

Scientists have also said they fear for the future of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology – the platform that underpinned the fast development of Covid-19 vaccines and that held promise for treating and preventing a wide range of diseases.

Hoeg served on Florida’s public health integrity committee, which served as a platform for Covid-19 criticism during the pandemic. At the time, it was chaired by the Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, who has also sown doubt about the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines.

Hoeg could be further buttressed by insiders such as Dr Matthew Memoli, who, Kennedy said, “is going to be running Niaid [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]”. Memoli, whom Kennedy described as “the top flu researcher at NIH”, is known for opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and declined to be vaccinated. In March, Memoli sent an email to NIH grant officials requiring any grant applications that reference mRNA technology to be reported to Kennedy’s office. He also canceled government-backed studies on vaccine hesitancy.

The nominee for HHS general counsel, Michael B Stuart, is also well-known for involvement in vaccine fights. Stuart, a former West Virginia lawmaker, in 2023 proposed a bill to exempt virtual public school students from vaccine requirements and allow private schools to set their own requirements, according to Stat.

“Dismantling the sort of vaccine infrastructure this country relies upon – that’s been in place for several dozens and dozens of years – only impacts the chronic disease front he’s trying to ameliorate as well,” said James Hodge, a professor of law at Arizona State University and a health law expert who said he worries about the future of vaccine advisory committees. “Acquiring infectious diseases leads to chronic conditions later.”

Still, some of Kennedy’s most ardent supporters and reported informal advisers, such as the former cardiologist Peter McCullough, have argued these actions don’t go far enough.

“The big threat is that we still have Covid-19 vaccines on the market,” McCullough told KFF Health News. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate – I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?” McCullough did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.

In the latest change, Kennedy said this week he may remove Covid-19 shots from the childhood vaccine schedule, which would probably make the shots harder to get by limiting insurance coverage.

“The recommendation for children was always dubious,” Kennedy told Fox News. Although a minority of children are vaccinated, the shots are recommended, especially for immune-compromised children.

Freeman believes the desire to erase the government’s Covid legacy led to HHS’s decision to claw back $11bn in public health funds from states and localities. In effect done overnight, the clawback gave local officials only hours to lay off workers, cancel immunization clinics and even stop construction projects.

“That’s why we feel like the drawback of the funding occurred: Covid,” said Freeman.

A spokesperson for HHS characterized this as a savings, and said most canceled awards were for Covid-19-related work. [...] 

Reiss said she doesn’t think “any vaccine that’s in the pipeline is going to go forward under Kennedy” or that “he will let any vaccine go far now”.

Dr Tracy Hoeg, a political appointee, was reportedly involved in the decision. Hoeg also appeared as the FDA’s representative at a special advisory committee on immunizations in April, where she took the opportunity to question the efficacy of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.

An HHS spokesperson told the Guardian: “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines, is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations.

Afghanistan’s latest case was reported from Hilmand province, bringing the county’s total for the year to two. Elsewhere, two countries in Africa reported more circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, including Ethiopia with three cases from two locations, bringing its total to 11, and Nigeria with one more case, which also lifts its total to 11 for 2025.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745608964.0,African countries see payoff from ramped-up mpox strategies,"Mpox cases in the African region have been declining over the past 6 weeks, due to the intensification of key public health steps, such as deploying more community health workers to do contact tracing and active surveillance, a top official from Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said yesterday at the group’s regular weekly briefing.

However, Yap Boum, PhD, MPH, deputy incident manager for Africa CDC’s mpox response, said the region still remains on guard, with the virus popping up in new countries—most recently in Malawi—and with 17 of 24 countries still reporting active transmission.

**Promising trends in hot spot countries**

Part of the decline is due to a drop in cases in Burundi, one of the outbreak hot spots, Boum said, noting that the country had been averaging 200 new cases a week but is now reporting about 30 a week. Improvements in outbreak response, which has included decentralized testing, will make a lasting imprint on the county’s health system, he said. “Burundi will be a different country.”

Officials are also seeing promising trends in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where conflict in some of the hardest hit regions in the East and foreign aid cuts have led to decreased testing rates and posed other major challenges to the outbreak response, Boum said.

In the DRC, the goal is to keep increasing testing coverage, “so that we are confident in the total picture that we see on the ground,” he said. In the Kinshasa hot spot, community health workers are going household to household to identify cases earlier and contacts who are candidates for the country’s targeted mpox vaccine strategy.

The DRC has received 754,000 vaccine doses and is expecting 300,000 million more in the weeks ahead.

North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, where conflict is still flaring, still carries the country’s highest burden, and Boum said outbreaks of measles, with a rash that resembles mpox, is complicating efforts and speaks to the need for a multiplex test that can distinguish between the two diseases.

He said other countries are at different outbreak phases, with Uganda—like Burundi—reporting a promising decline in cases and deaths. However, he said cases are trending upward in Kenya, which is experiencing infections in truck drivers. The country recently launched its mpox vaccination campaign.

**Evidence points to community circulation in Malawi**

Malawi’s health ministry this week declared an mpox outbreak, with three cases initially reported.

Four cases have now been reported from two districts, three from Lilongwe and one from Mangochi, Boum said. One of the patients is a 2-year-old child, and all are male. So far, 34 contacts have been identified.

None of the patients have a history of travel to outbreak areas, suggesting that the virus is circulating within the country, he said. Sequencing on samples from patients has identified the clade 1b virus.

**Rapid tests under evaluation**

Boum said two rapid mpox tests are under evaluation at the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), one from Conti Pharma and the other from Revital Healthcare. None of the tests in earlier evaluation had met minimal sensitivity requirements.

Rapid tests can be used in the lowest level health settings and can quickly identify cases, useful for preventing onward spread, he said. “This can be a changemaker in the response, he said.",1k7tgnd,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/african-countries-see-payoff-ramped-mpox-strategies,11
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745516140.0,Scientists Find Measles Likely To Become Endemic in the US Over Next 20 Years,"A new study forecasts more than 850,000 measles cases over the next 25 years if US vaccination rates stay the same. Millions of infections are possible if rates drop.

With vaccination rates among US kindergarteners steadily declining in recent years and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. A new analysis published today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts.

Using a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

“I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.”

[...] 
In the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study.

Under a scenario with a 10 percent decline in measles vaccination, the model estimates 11.1 million cases of measles over the next 25 years, while a 5 percent increase in the vaccination rate would result in just 5,800 cases in that same time period.
In addition to measles, the authors used their model to assess the risk of rubella, polio, and diphtheria. The researchers chose these four diseases for their infectiousness and risk of severe complications. While sporadic cases of these diseases do occur and are usually related to international travel, they are no longer endemic in the US, meaning they no longer regularly occur.

The model predicted that rubella, polio, and diphtheria are unlikely to become endemic under current levels of vaccination. Rubella and polio have a basic reproduction number of four, while diphtheria’s is less than three. In 81 percent of simulations, vaccination rates would need to fall by around 35 percent for rubella to become endemic in the next 25 years. Polio, meanwhile, had a 50 percent chance of becoming endemic if vaccination rates dropped 40 percent. Diphtheria was the least likely disease to become reestablished.

“Any of these diseases, under the right conditions, could come back,” says coauthor Nathan Lo, a Stanford physician and assistant professor of infectious diseases.

To evaluate the validity of the model, the researchers ran a scenario with recent state-level vaccine coverage rates over a five-year period and found that the number of model-predicted cases broadly aligned with the number of observed cases in those years. The authors also found that Texas was at the highest risk for measles.

One limitation of the study was that the model assumed that vaccination rates were the same across all communities within a state. It didn’t take into account large variations in vaccination levels. Pockets of low vaccination rates, like in the Mennonite community at the center of the West Texas outbreak, would likely lead to local outbreaks that are larger than expected given the overall vaccination rate.

The study also didn’t take into account the possibility that vaccination rates could rebound in an area in response to an outbreak. “That’s the thing that we have control over. If you’re able to change that cycle, then that disease won’t spread anymore,” says Mujeeb Basit, associate chief of the Clinical Informatics Center at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the study.
Kiang and Lo say the full impact of decreased vaccination will likely not be seen for decades. “It’s important to note that it’s totally feasible that vaccinations go down and nothing happens for a little while. That’s actually what the model says,” Kiang says. “But eventually, these things are going to catch up to us.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745525812.0,"Public health leaders, distrustful of RFK Jr., stand up project to defend vaccines","Some key public health figures are taking an extraordinary step to try to shore up U.S. vaccination policy, feared to be under threat from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic.

The “Vaccine Integrity Project,” which was publicly launched Thursday by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, will be aimed at assessing the best ways for vaccine proponents to safeguard vaccination policy and information, should government recommendations and information sources become “corrupted,” Michael Osterholm, director of the center, said during a press conference.

Though plans for the project are still taking shape, Osterholm said it might go so far as to create a new independent body to evaluate the science supporting individual vaccines — a task that at this point falls squarely in the domain of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Osterholm stressed, though, that the body, if formed, could not serve as a shadow version of the ACIP. That’s because it would not have the same legal authorities as the ACIP, such as deciding which vaccines must be provided through the Vaccines for Children Program. The program provides vaccinations for free to children who qualify; just over half of U.S. children are eligible for vaccines through VFC. 

Margaret Hamburg, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — will chair a steering committee that will spend the summer meeting with key stakeholders to decide how the project should proceed. They suggested some of the actions the group may explore include developing clinical guidelines and identifying areas where further research is needed.

We take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,” the two wrote in an opinion piece published Thursday in STAT. “Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.”

[...] 

Earlier this week Politico reported that he is considering unilaterally striking Covid vaccines from the childhood vaccination schedule, a guide devised by the ACIP and the CDC and used by medical professionals to determine which vaccines children should receive, and at what age. If Covid vaccines were no longer listed on the childhood immunization schedule, insurance companies would not have to pay for the vaccines and they would not be eligible for provision through the Vaccines for Children Program.

Osterholm said that the aim of the Vaccine Integrity Project is to try to establish a roadmap for what could be done if government sources of information on vaccines can no longer be trusted. “We all recognize that the vaccine enterprise is at some risk right now,” he said.

The effort is being funded through an unrestricted grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by philanthropist Christy Walton.

It says a total of 1,020 people have had measles since the province’s outbreak began last October.

The agency says the ongoing rise in cases is “due to continued exposures and transmission among individuals who have not been immunized.”

Many of the new cases continue to be reported in southwestern Ontario.

Three-quarters of the total measles cases in Ontario have been infants, children and teens.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745454195.0,Whooping Cough on Track for Worst US Outbreak in 70 Years,"Whooping cough cases have surged in the US since the beginning of the year, infecting Americans at a faster pace than any time since the mid-1950s as national vaccination rates decline and protection wanes. 

The bacterial infection also known as pertussis has sickened 8,077 people in the US through April 16, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. **That’s more than double the same period a year ago, when the agency confirmed 3,847 cases, and rivals the 2012 outbreak that was the biggest in half a century.**

At least four people have died from whooping cough this year, including two infants in Louisiana, an adult in Idaho and a child in South Dakota who was infected with both influenza and pertussis.

The rise in cases comes as the US battles a measles outbreak, with 800 confirmed cases in 24 states as of April 18. Doctors point to a decline in vaccination rates nationally for the pickup in infections. Fewer than 93% of kindergartners received routine vaccinations for the 2023-2024 school year, including the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis shot that protects against whooping cough.

While measles is the canary in the coal mine for vaccine-preventable diseases in childhood, whooping cough is the infection doctors are seeing more and more of, said David Higgins, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. Once vaccination rates for measles drop, pediatricians know they have also declined for other preventable diseases including whooping cough, he said.

Pertussis was common before the invention of the vaccine in the 1940s, according to the CDC. Cases began climbing in the 1980s before withering during the Covid-19 pandemic. The US is returning to pre-pandemic levels of more than 10,000 cases a year.

Symptoms of whooping cough may not develop for as long as three weeks, with early signs resembling the common cold, according to the CDC. One indication of pertussis is the progression to a brutal cough, often in uncontrolled fits that are followed by the high-pitched whoop that gives the disease its name.

Babies and children are at risk of developing severe and sometimes deadly complications, including pneumonia, brain disease and convulsions. One in 100 children infected will die from it, according to the agency.

Even among those who are vaccinated, protection can wane over time. The Atlanta-based health agency recommends the shot and boosters for children, pregnant women and adults who were never immunized. While those who are vaccinated can still contract the disease, their symptoms are typically milder and they are less likely to spread the bacteria in their communities.

The DTaP vaccine is recommended for babies as young as two months, with two booster shots by six months of age. Children get two more shots in early childhood, and another as a pre-teen or teenager.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745421500.0,RFK Jr. could pull Covid vax for kids,"HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is mulling removing the Covid-19 vaccine from the recommended childhood vaccine schedule, two people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO’s Adam Cancryn.

The directive, if implemented, would mark Kennedy’s most significant move yet to shake up the nation’s vaccination practices, affecting a CDC schedule that health providers nationwide rely on to guide vaccine distribution.

Background: Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has previously questioned the need for kids to get the shot, raising doubts about its safety and citing studies showing healthy children face an extremely low risk of death from Covid.

Why it matters: Eliminating the vaccine from the CDC schedule wouldn’t bar kids from receiving it. But the change would represent an extraordinary intervention by Kennedy to override the agency’s scientific decision-making and reverse a recommendation backed by the CDC and a slate of independent advisers just three years ago.

The removal would also likely influence vaccination procedures across the nation. Pediatricians rely on the CDC schedule to determine which vaccines they should give children and when to administer them to protect against a range of common infectious diseases.

Additionally, insurers closely watch the schedule to decide which vaccines to cover, as do states and localities to mandate vaccines for students — though no states currently require the Covid shot to attend school.

The removal’s specifics are still being discussed and could change, said the two people, who were granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

“No final decision has been made,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in response to questions about the vaccine’s spot on the childhood schedule.

But Kennedy has advocated internally to take the Covid vaccine off the schedule, the people said, arguing that there’s minimal scientific evidence for including it among the earliest vaccines given to kids.",1k61rtl,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/04/23/rfk-jr-could-pull-covid-vax-for-kids-00305579,114
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745416596.0,"Americans unsure what to believe about the measles vaccine, poll shows","
Most Americans have encountered false claims about the measles vaccine, and many aren’t sure what the truth is, according to a KFF poll released Wednesday.

Misconceptions about measles, a highly contagious virus, and its vaccine abound as cases continue rising across the United States, according to the poll. Prominent false claims suggest that there is a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; that the vaccine is more dangerous than measles itself; and that vitamin A can prevent measles infections. More than half of surveyed adults expressed uncertainty about whether to believe the false statements, which Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has amplified.

The proliferation of measles misinformation may have far-reaching implications, said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, a health policy research organization.

“When we look at parents, those who believe or lean toward believing one of those false claims, they’re more likely to delay or skip vaccines for their children, compared to other parents,” she said. “There’s a relationship between belief or openness to believing misinformation about measles, and decisions to vaccinate your own children.”

There are about 800 confirmed measles cases spanning 25 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two children have died of measles-related complications, and a third death has been linked to the infection so far this year. All three people who died were unvaccinated.

Amid the outbreak, the CDC has been stifled, messaging has been muddled and public health funding has been slashed, The Washington Post has reported. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, initially underplayed the severity of the outbreak and stressed that vaccination is a “personal choice.” He has contended that he is simply seeking good data about vaccines and said during his confirmation hearing that he supports the measles vaccine.

 Kennedy has previously linked vaccines to autism — though decades of scientific research prove there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. He has claimed that the measles shot causes “deaths every year,” touted “lifetime protection against measles” after an infection and directed the CDC to add language to its measles care guidance endorsing the use of vitamin A, which has been promoted by anti-vaccine activists as an alternative to vaccination.
After a second child died of measles in Texas, Kennedy posted on social media that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” (Hours later, he praised two doctors who are prominent critics of vaccines.)

The nationally representative KFF survey of 1,380 adults, conducted April 8 to April 15, found that more than 6 in 10 adults have heard the false claim suggesting a proven link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. A third of adults reported hearing the false claim suggesting that the vaccine is more dangerous than measles itself, and about a fifth of adults said they heard that vitamin A can prevent measles.

Less than 5 percent of adults say that each of the three claims is “definitely true,” according to the poll. But fewer than half of the adults said each claim is “definitely false.”

About one-quarter of adults (27 percent) said it is “definitely false” that vitamin A can prevent measles infections; 34 percent of adults said that a link between the vaccine and autism is “definitely false”; and 43 percent of adults said it is “definitely false” that getting the measles vaccine is more dangerous than contracting measles.

A vast swath of adults — more than half — express uncertainty about each claim, describing each statement as “probably true” or “probably false.”

“We looked at statements that we know have been circulating in social media and other arenas. For at least two of these statements, these are things that have been linked to what the HHS Secretary has said in public remarks,” Hamel said, adding that there were also news reports of Texas children with toxic levels of vitamin A.

“We find few people are definitely convinced that these claims are true — but a large share of people aren’t totally convinced that they’re false,” Hamel said — a segment of the population she referred to as “the malleable middle,” who aren’t sure what to believe. This leaves room for fact, or fiction.

The claim that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than a measles infection proliferated compared with last year, jumping from 18 percent to 33 percent of adults who had heard the false statement. There was no shift since last year in the percentage of adults saying this is probably or definitely true, though the percentage saying it is “definitely false” grew from 38 percent to 43 percent.

There has been no increase since 2023 in awareness of the false claim that MMR vaccines cause autism, and also no change in belief in this claim since then.
Nearly a quarter of adults say that it is “definitely” or “probably true” that there’s a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and a quarter of adults said that it is “definitely” or “probably true” that vitamin A can prevent measles, according to the poll. [...] 


The information gap has tangible consequences. Among parents, 24 percent who lean toward believing at least one of the three false claims say that they delayed or skipped some recommended vaccines for their children, according to the poll. That’s more than double compared with parents who say all three claims are “definitely” or “probably false” — 11 percent of those parents opted out of some recommended vaccines for their children.

The divide is partisan, too. “We found that larger shares of Republicans compared with Democrats lean toward believing some of these falsehoods,” Hamel said.

Overall, the majority of parents still believe that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks, Hamel said. But the number of parents that are skeptical — contending that the risks outweigh the benefits — has inched up.

“An erosion in confidence in vaccines down the road could have greater effect,” Hamel said. “With something like measles that can be deadly for children, and where you need high levels of vaccination to keep it from circulating, even some of these small increases could have repercussions.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745333234.0,North Carolina: Mpox virus detected in Pitt County wastewater,"Pitt County health officials are urging awareness and caution after a type of mpox virus, known as clade I, was detected in wastewater samples collected in Greenville. The samples were collected on March 25, March 28, and April 8 through routine testing conducted by the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network. This program monitors viruses in multiple communities, providing early detection of infections like COVID-19, flu, RSV, and now mpox. The virus found in wastewater is no longer infectious, but it shows that people in the area may be carrying the virus—even if they don’t have symptoms.

At this time, the risk to the public remains low and no cases of clade I mpox have been reported in North Carolina. However, this wastewater detection suggests there may have been at least one person with an undiagnosed or unreported infection in the area at the time.

“Finding the virus in wastewater doesn’t mean there is a community outbreak, but it does mean we need to stay alert,” said Wes Gray, Pitt County Health Director. “We encourage residents to learn the symptoms, take precautions, and get vaccinated if they are eligible.”

Mpox virus has two types: clade I and clade II. The clade II strain has been part of a more widely know outbreak, primarily affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Clade I mpox has mostly been seen in Central and Eastern Africa, spreading through heterosexual contact and occasionally affecting household members, including children. Vaccines are available to protect against mpox infection from both clade types and can reduce the severity of illness if an infection does occur.

The steady rise in cases puts the nation on track for the worst year since 2019, fueled by 10 outbreaks and rising numbers of travel-linked cases, part of a global surge in measles activity.

**Along with Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma add more cases**

Most of the new cases in Texas were reported from Gaines County, which has been the epicenter. However, 26 of the state’s counties have reported cases, with Bailey County as the latest added to the list.

Of the state’s cases, 602 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. So far, 64 people have been hospitalized, and the number of deaths remains at two.

In New Mexico, which has reported related cases in a few bordering counties, the health department today reported 2 more cases, putting the state’s total at 65. Four of New Mexico’s counties have reported cases, but most are from Lea County.

Oklahoma has also reported a few cases linked to the Texas outbreak, and today the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported one more confirmed case, bringing its total to 13, which included 10 confirmed and 3 probable cases. All were unvaccinated.

The state’s most recent exposures were at a mall in Norman and at a town hall in Slaughterville.

Meanwhile, Kansas health officials are battling an outbreak in the southwestern part of the state that has been genetically linked to the event in Texas. So far, 37 cases have been reported from eight counties, which officials today said is probably the tip of the iceberg.

Avian influenza is constantly changing. Every new infection increases the odds bird flu could potentially become more deadly or easily transmissible between humans, infectious disease expert Dr. Kamran Khan warns. Today, the virus does not spread person to person, but Khan warns that could change. His company BlueDot was among the first to flag the virus in China that led to the COVID pandemic. Khan said bird flu is just as concerning.

Khan said he wants people to know ""this is a very serious threat to humanity"" and that the longer bird flu is left to spread, ""the greater the risks are going to be.""

""We are really at risk of this virus evolving into one that has pandemic potential,"" Khan said. ""And the reality is none of us know whether this is next week, or next year, or never. I don't think it's never. But it may be here far sooner than any of us would like."" [...] 

**It's a numbers game**

In past outbreaks of H5N1 around the world, bird flu has often been deadly. Despite the urgency, Russo and other vets said the Biden administration was slow to act. It was a month before the U.S. Department of Agriculture required cows to be tested before interstate travel, and 10 months before a raw milk testing program was launched. Today, some states test weekly, some hardly at all.

""At present, we're given a stick, and they put a blindfold on us, and we're sent into a gunfight and we're losing. We are losing,"" Russo said. 

Russo, who is most concerned by the pandemic potential of the virus, warned that the U.S. is running out of time to stop bird flu. She told 60 Minutes her fears about a possible pandemic are the worst case scenario, but at the moment the virus has the upper hand. Russo says the U.S. hasn't done enough testing of animals or humans to know how the virus is spreading.

""I think it's a numbers game, and the more we let it move unchecked, the more likely we're gonna have even a bigger mess on our hands,"" Russo said. 

Bird flu has spread to over 1,000 dairy herds across the country. It has also jumped to dozens of other mammals — a rapid and unprecedented spread, infectious disease physician Khan said.

""And it's showing us that the virus is capable of adaptation. If you allow it, it will just get better and better at infecting other mammals, including potentially humans,"" Khan said. [...] 

Virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen said she's alarmed by the way bird flu is jumping to more mammals; every new spillover gives the virus another chance to evolve and possibly start spreading from person to person. There have been cases in foxes, goats, pigs, rats, cats and raccoons. 

""The fact that this virus can infect so many different types of mammals is a huge concern in terms of its ability to infect people,"" Rasmussen said. 

It's something she admitted she's worried about.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745249502.0,"Ticks, allergies, measles, top nutrition scientist resigns, covid.gov gets a rebrand, and the HHS budget proposal (via Your Local Epidemiologist)","Goodbye, respiratory season. Hello, ticks, allergies, and spring cleaning. Meanwhile, public health gutting continues: the administration’s top nutrition scientist resigned due to concerns over censorship, the Covid.gov website underwent a dramatic shift in direction, and a huge $40 billion cut proposal for Health and Human Services.

Here’s the context and what it means for you.

**It’s spring! Enter tick season**

Emergency department visits for tick bites are climbing, but remain middle-of-the-road for now. By year’s end, more than 500,000 people will likely be diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease.

Ticks thrive in warm, lush spring environments and can carry pathogens responsible for over a dozen diseases—including Lyme disease, which can cause flu-like symptoms and, if untreated, serious complications like neurological or cardiac issues.

Not all ticks carry disease. Risk depends on the species, geography, and the duration of a tick’s attachment. Currently, tick-borne illnesses are most concentrated in the Northeast, with emergency department (ED) visits at 115 per 100,000 people.

What does this mean for you? You can take several steps to protect yourself from ticks, including applying DEET or picaridin, treating clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin, and conducting thorough tick checks after engaging in outdoor activities. 

**Cue: A rough allergy season**

The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) says it’s going to be a brutal year. 41% of the U.S. is currently experiencing medium-high allergy levels—especially in the South and East. Cities like Atlanta and Houston have already set records for pollen. Below is a live allergy map for 2025, showing pollen counts across the country that shift over time in your area.

Allergy season is becoming longer—plants are releasing pollen earlier in the year (about 40 days earlier) and stopping pollination later in the year (about 2 weeks longer)—due to rising temperatures. It’s also more pollen because of the increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

What does this mean for you? You’re getting exposed to more “pollen grains,” and your immune system may be irritated by them. Dr. Zach Rubin, an allergy doctor, joined us on our podcast America Dissected last week and gave great tips on managing allergies:

Rinse your nose with saline water (just like we brush our teeth)

Go with second-generation antihistamines, like Zyrtec, instead of Benadryl. Benadryl was made in the 1940s as one of the first antihistamine drugs, but it has a lot of side effects. Always chat with your doctor for more information.

**The measles game of whack-a-mole continues.**

Measles cases are climbing exponentially. The U.S. has 839 cases and 7 active outbreaks, spanning states like Montana, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas.

The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas is growing rapidly. My concern about spreading in urban areas is coming to fruition. The El Paso outbreak is spreading fast. Within 11 days we rose from 2 cases to 11, signaling exponential growth. In Lubbock, cases are also on the rise. In particular, a cluster has been identified in the Tiny Tots daycare, resulting in 7 cases and 2 hospitalizations thus far.

This outbreak has also extended into Mexico (the country; not to be confused with New Mexico), with 451 cases reported, primarily in Chihuahua, and Canada, with 1,045 cases, mainly in Ontario. The Canada outbreak has been traced back to a large gathering in New Brunswick last fall that was attended by guests from Mennonite communities. [...]

Other sporadic cases continue to emerge across the country, often linked to international travel (see map above).

What does this mean for you? Keep up on vaccinations. If you plan to travel with a child under 12 months, be sure it’s not to a high-risk area (either nationally or internationally).

**H5N1 is still quiet. And we don’t know why**

Many of you have asked for an update: H5N1 is currently pretty quiet. Over 1,000 dairy cow herds across 17 states have been infected with H5N1. However, new infections have slowed considerably—both in cows and poultry. The most recent human case was in December 2024.

We don’t know why, but there are a few epidemiological guesses:

It began to run out of herds to infect.

Expanded milk testing is allowing faster containment.

It was an oddly active winter, so a spring spike hasn’t appeared.

The virus burned through enough of the migratory fowl.

Unknown unknowns.

I don’t think anything is being hidden, especially on the human side. That would be near impossible to keep under wraps.

What does this mean for you? Bird flu isn’t something that should be top of mind. The pandemic risk has decreased for now, although scientists continue to monitor it.

Virginia reported its first case of measles on Saturday as well, in a child under 4 years old who recently traveled internationally, according to the Virginia Department of Health.

To protect the family's privacy, no other information will be released, the VDH said in a statement. It's not clear if the child was vaccinated.

""This first case of measles in Virginia this year is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,"" said VDH State Epidemiologist Laurie Forlano.

On Friday, Missouri reported the state's first case of measles in 2025, in a child who is an international traveler with unknown vaccination status, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.

No other cases have been identified, and health officials have alerted those who may have been exposed.

The U.S. measles outbreak has reached 800 confirmed cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.

The current outbreak in Texas has claimed two lives, with a third death under investigation in New Mexico, according to state health officials. The surge in cases is nearly triple the total number reported in 2024, when the nation recorded 285 cases.If this year's cases continue to grow at the current rate, the U.S. could surpass the 2019 total of 1,274 cases, potentially reaching the highest level since 1992, per data.Six states are currently battling significant outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases: Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, and Michigan.

Health officials report that 96% of this year's cases have occurred in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status.Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through coughing and sneezing.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745090436.0,You’ve Been Lied to About Rats and the Black Death,"Rats have long been associated with and blamed for the spread of plague, a disease that has killed over 200 million people throughout the past two millennia. The Black Death, a bubonic plague pandemic, is estimated to have resulted in the death of nearly 50% of Europe’s 14th century population, making it one of the deadliest disease outbreaks in human history. However, emerging research suggests that rats may not have played a central role in the outbreak and transmission of plague. The historical attribution of plague’s spread to rats was neither an incidental nor trivial occurrence; instead, it had important and serious sociopolitical consequences that should not be overlooked.  

What exactly is plague? Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative bacterium, causes the infectious disease known as plague. Plague has three different forms (bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic), each of which affect different parts of the body. Although people mostly talk about the Black Death, plague killed millions of people through three distinct pandemics in human history: the First (541-750s), the Second (1346-1700s, beginning with the Black Death), and the Third Pandemic (1855-mid-20th century).  

Traditionally, rats have been blamed as the main culprits responsible for the outbreak and spread of plague. Rats, along with other rodents, can become infected with and harbour Yersinia pestis without becoming seriously ill. This implicates them as potential reservoirs of plague–in other words, hosts that allow the bacteria to survive and proliferate. When fleas bite these infected rats, they also begin to carry the disease. As such, rats and their fleas were widely viewed as the main vectors of plague, spreading it to humans by biting them.  

However, recent research is increasingly suggesting that rats may not have played as key a role in plague epidemics as previously thought. In their 2018 study, Katharine Dean et al. utilized mathematical models to study three possible routes of human plague transmission: infected rat fleas biting people, infected human fleas biting people and people directly infecting others via coughing and vomit. These researchers decided to focus on and distinguish human fleas due to the fact that rat fleas are known to prefer to bite rats. Theoretically, if a human flea became infected after biting an affected person, they could transmit the disease by also biting other people living in close proximity.  

Each of these models predicted different patterns of disease-induced death; for example, if the disease spread mainly through direct person-to-person transmission, we would expect a sharp, short-lived spike in deaths. Conversely, if rat fleas were mainly spreading plague by biting humans, we would expect a reduced number of deaths sustained over a longer time period. When comparing the results of their mathematical models to the mortality data recorded from nine different Second Pandemic outbreaks, the authors found that their human parasite model fit best. **In other words, their findings suggest that human fleas and lice, not rats or their fleas, were primarily responsible for spreading plague during the Black Death.** Other research has corroborated these findings; studies by Nils Stenseth et al. (2022) and Anne Hufthammer (2013) have indicated that the environmental conditions in Europe could not have permitted the survival of long-term animal reservoirs, suggesting that black rats may not have played a central role in the rapid spread of plague seen in the Black Death.  

Historically, rats have been strongly associated with plague, and have since become vivid symbols for illness, darkness, squalor and decay. They are, for example, famously portrayed as harbingers of the plague in Albert Camus’s 1947 absurdist novel La Peste. Through his uncanny depiction of them, Camus effectively established rats as symbols of a surreal and nonsensical calamity that served as an allegory for fascism.   

Naturally, this raises a question: if rats only played a relatively minor role in the spread of plague, how did they come to be widely depicted as the primary transmitters of the disease? The idea that plague spreads from rats to humans was not always prevalent–in fact, prior to the mid 19th century, rats were seen as simply being infected alongside humans. Through a thorough historical investigation of primary sources from the Third Pandemic, medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris was able to determine when the concept of rat-to-human plague infection was introduced for the first time. In 1874, the French bishop Joseph Ponsot wrote a letter notifying the Society of the Propagation of the Faith (which backed global Catholic missions) of a catastrophic epidemic in the Chinese province of Yunnan. This letter was then widely circulated after it was published in the main publication of the Society of the Propagation of the Faith—however, the published version contained major changes compared to the original manuscript. Notably, unlike the original letter, the publication clearly stated that rats could not only become infected with plague but also spread it to humans.  

Lynteris contends that historians and life scientists have taken these kinds of historical sources describing plague transmission at face value, thus treating them as objective pieces of epidemiological evidence without regard for historical context. As any good historian will tell you, primary sources must be analyzed within the context of the perspectives and motivations of those who created them. Keeping this in mind, Lynteris argues that the image of a plague-spreading “staggering rat” was not intended to factually describe an observed mode of disease transmission but was instead aimed at depicting the Third Pandemic as a discordant, all-encompassing disaster that transgressed the natural order. This depiction was used to justify and promote colonialism and religious conversion, which—in the view of those disseminating this outbreak narrative—were the only possible solutions to this catastrophe.  

What can we take away from all of this? The emergence of the rat-to-human transmission model during the Third Pandemic—which underlined an “end of the world” narrative used to further colonial agendas—makes it abundantly clear that the stories we tell about how diseases break out and spread have important consequences. As the COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS pandemics have also shown us, these narratives can either exacerbate or mitigate the stigmatization of individuals, groups, cultures and lifestyles. They also influence how both scientists and the general public perceive the threat and nature of infectious diseases, thus affecting how they respond to them. Science does not exist independently of society; rather, it is shaped by and deeply intertwined with our beliefs, values and worldviews in a complex and intricate way.",1k342fd,https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical-critical-thinking-history/youve-been-lied-about-rats-and-black-death,221

The pace of activity in the first 4 months of the year is well on track to pass the 2019 total of 1,274 cases, which was the most since the United States officially eliminated the virus in 2000. In its update, the CDC said 94% of cases this year are part outbreaks, which have reached 10 now—3 more than the previous week.

Half of all US states have reported cases, some of which are linked to international travel. Among illnesses reported so far, 96% of patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. So far, 85 patients (11%) were hospitalized, with the number of deaths remaining at 3.

**Texas nears 600 infections**

In the main outbreak hot spot, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 36 more cases since April 15, boosting the state's total to 597, of which 371 are from Gaines County, though 24 other counties have also reported cases.

In its list of other measles cases, the TDSHS reported 15 case-patients from Upshur County in the eastern part of the state, 2 of whom are Upshur County residents. Officials are examining the residency status of the other patients to determine if the cases are linked to the West Texas outbreak.

Outbreaks in New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment this week reported 5 more cases, bringing its total to 37 infections in eight counties.

**Michigan reports outbreak, Montana reports cases**

Yesterday the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department reported the state's first measles outbreak since 2019, which involves three cases from Montcalm County in the western part of the state. Official added that the outbreak was initially linked to a large ongoing outbreak in Ontario, Canada.

In other outbreak developments, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services yesterday confirmed the state's first measles cases since 1990. Officials said they are investigating five cases, which include children and adults living in Gallatin County who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of the state.

All were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Officials said the patients are isolating at home and that so far two potential public exposure sites in Belgrade and Bozeman have been identified.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745011825.0,White House trumpets Covid lab leak theory on web page that was devoted to health information,"A government website long used to provide the latest guidelines on managing Covid-19, as well as information on how to receive tests, vaccines and treatments has now been replaced with a page proclaiming the virus emerged from a lab in Wuhan, China and that Anthony Fauci, the Biden Administration and others worked to cover it up. 

The website, Covid.gov, now opens to a banner reading “LAB LEAK, The True Origins of Covid-19”, with a picture of President Trump striding between the words “lab” and “leak.”

It goes on, after listing several claims on Covid’s origins and citing President Biden’s pardon of Fauci, to walk through a series of other right-wing concerns over the pandemic, around social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of nursing homes, and White House and social media company efforts to push against “alternative treatments.”

“Public health officials often mislead the American people through conflicting messaging, knee-jerk reactions, and a lack of transparency,” it concludes in a section titled Covid-19 Misinformation.  “Most egregiously, the federal government demonized alternative treatments and disfavored narratives, such as the lab leak theory, in a shameful effort to coerce and control the American people’s health decisions.”

The lab leak theory, debated at length over the past five years, had become a cause célèbre on the right. 

Many Republicans argue former NIH leaders suppressed discussion of the theory — Facebook banned posts promoting the idea of lab leak in February 2020, during the first Trump Administration — one of several grievances that then helped fuel Trump’s victory in the 2024 election. 

The new web page, on a site that had once provided basic public health information, is the latest effort by the new Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  to reshape the nation’s public health agencies.  “Alternative treatments” appears to be a reference to drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that Kennedy and others promoted after large studies had shown they were ineffective. 

Covid.gov now redirects to whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19. Guidance on Covid-19, including information about tests, treatments and long Covid can still be found at https://www.cdc.gov/covid. 

The idea that Covid-19 emerged from a lab — and not in a spillover from animals at a wet market or elsewhere — has gained support in the last couple of years. It was the subject of a 2024 House Republican report, as well as news articles in Vanity Fair, the New York Times, and ProPublica, among other outlets. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Energy, and the Central Intelligence Agency have each concluded a lab leak was the most probable origin, although the details of their analyses have largely not been made public and they didn’t rule out alternatives. 

Many scientists, though, still point to a spillover as the most likely origin theory, pointing to a range of findings. That includes evidence potentially linking the coronavirus to raccoon dogs at the Hunan wet market; that early cases were clustered around the market; that genetic evidence suggests the virus only emerged at the very end of 2019.

“I just would like to compliment the branding,” said Angie Rasmussen, a researcher at University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon, Canada, who studies emerging viruses and has vocally argued for zoonotic spillover as the most likely cause. “It’s truly a triumph of graphic design but most of these points are not accurate.”",1k2g7b3,https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/18/covid-lab-leak-theory-trump-replaces-pandemic-guidance-website-with-disputed-claims-alleged-coverup/,105
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1745007544.0,"Five people, 27 animals tested positive for tularemia in Minnesota last year","In 2024, five people and 27 animals in Minnesota contracted the rare bacterial disease tularemia in the seven-county Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, state health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported yesterday in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Two of the infected people reported recently mowing over animal carcasses; all were hospitalized for a median of 6 days and released without complications.

Each year from 2000 to 2023, a median of one person and two animals in the state were diagnosed as having the potentially serious illness, usually transmitted via tick or deer-fly bites, inhalation of contaminated material, or contact with infected animals, the authors noted. Animal tularemia cases spiked in Minnesota in 2023, with 20 cases; no human cases were reported.

Tularemia cases have been rising in the United States, climbing by more than half from 2011 to 2022, the CDC reported in December 2024.

Caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, tularemia typically affects 200 to 300 people each year in the United States, most often in the central part of the country.

Symptoms depend on how the person was exposed and usually include fever and local signs such as swollen lymph nodes and skin ulcers. There is no Food and Drug Administration–approved vaccine against tularemia. 

**Four patients had pneumonic disease**

Of the five people diagnosed in 2024, four had pneumonic tularemia, which is usually caused by inhaling bacteria-containing dust or aerosols. Three patients weren't diagnosed as having tularemia until after hospital release. After diagnosis, all patients were prescribed the antibiotics ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as postexposure prevention.

In comparison, 2 of 32 (6.3%) human tularemia cases in Minnesota identified from 2000 to 2023 were the pneumonic form.

Of the 27 tularemia-positive animals reported via lab reports or veterinarians in 2024, 21 (78%) were domestic cats, 5 (19%) were domestic dogs, and 1 (4%) was a wild rabbit. Most animals had a nonlocalized typhoidal infection or oropharyngeal manifestations characterized by fever, mouth ulcers, and swollen lymph glands.

Four animals (15%) died of their infections, and two (7%) were euthanized due to a poor prognosis or concern about costs. Three pet owners and one veterinary worker were exposed, and one owner took antibiotics after a scratch from an infected cat, but none developed tularemia. 

No ticks were found during drag sampling for three human and two animal cases at the likely exposure site and nearby public spaces. In the case of the two patients who reported mowing over animal carcasses, rabbit and mouse remains found at the site were too decomposed for testing.

**Health workers advised to consider tularemia**

""Increased veterinary awareness after tularemia-related communications in 2023 likely contributed to the increase in animal tularemia case reporting, in addition to a true increase in cases,"" the authors wrote.

They urged healthcare providers to consider tularemia in patients with fever and history of tick or deer-fly bites, contact with sick animals, or mowing over a rabbit or rodent. 

""When ordering testing for a patient in whom tularemia is suspected, providers should alert the laboratory to ensure that laboratorians take appropriate precautions such as working in a biosafety cabinet and wearing gloves, gowns, and eye protection,"" they concluded. ""Veterinarians should consider tularemia in cats and dogs with compatible symptoms, including high fever, oral ulcers, and lymphadenopathy.""

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744981000.0,Life Before the Measles Vaccine,"Many people who contract measles don’t know right away that they have it. Days after infection, the symptoms can feel like the flu, until the tell-tale blotchy red rash emerges—usually near the hairline at first, later traveling down the biceps, abdomen, thighs, feet, hands. So far this year, 712 people in America are known to have been infected with the highly contagious disease. This number is already higher than last year’s, which totalled 285. The virus has been particularly widespread in West Texas, where two young girls have died—the first measles deaths America has seen in a decade. And the official cause of death of a New Mexico resident who contracted measles remains under investigation.

Each of the three people who died were unvaccinated, renewing the controversy over vaccine hesitancy. It is a stance that has been around for as long as vaccines have. But a time before the measles vaccine—before 1963, when the virus was so widespread that virtually every child was expected to fall ill from it—is beyond the memory of most generations today.
“My will I made last week, while I was in bed with the measles,” the 18-year-old Frances Anne Kemble, who later published her letters in The Atlantic, wrote in 1828. “I lay parched and full of pain and fever in my illness!”

Then Kemble’s account took an optimistic turn: “I have been very ill for the last fortnight, but am well again now. I am pressed for time to-day, but will soon write to you in earnest.” Even though measles infected millions of people each year in the 19th century, killing more than 12,000 people in 1900, it was seen as less worrisome than other diseases. Scarlet fever and smallpox had higher mortality rates, and the ubiquity of measles meant that contracting it was almost a rite of passage. (The word measly is derived from the virus, Adam Ratner noted in Booster Shots.) 

Consider the way in which the disease was written about in this magazine: A book review from 1859 mentions “a complaint as common to a certain period of life as measles.” And in 1871, a passion for collecting items was described as something that “befalls most boys, like measles or whooping-cough.”
Measles’ reputation as a common childhood illness also meant that health officials didn’t usually take mitigation efforts as seriously as they did for other diseases. 

In How the Other Half Lives, Jacob Riis described the virus’s devastating effects in New York City’s tenement housing in the 1880s, where impoverished and starving people gathered in close quarters with little access to hygiene: “Listen! That short hacking cough, that tiny, helpless wail—what do they mean? … The child is dying with measles. With half a chance it might have lived; but it had none.” He reported on records showing that respiratory diseases, including the flu and measles, were the most common cause of death in these housing conditions. But diphtheria and scarlet fever were “considered more dangerous to the public health,” so health officials moved those cases to hospitals, resulting in “a low death-rate.”

Recovery from measles is not always linear; contracting the virus can make people more vulnerable to other diseases. 

In 1925, one mother recalled pulling from the family’s savings to settle the bills for her children’s treatment. Those who were unable or unwilling to pay relied on homemade remedies that largely lacked scientific backing. Tansy and pennyroyal leaves could be steeped to make tea, and sometimes catnip would be used as well, according to a 1933 Atlantic article. Anybody bold (or desperate) enough could try “sheep tea,” which got its name from the main ingredient of dried sheep manure.

Though drinking rehydrated animal waste might seem outlandish today, the prospect of using unconventional methods to treat measles hasn’t faded from popularity. 

Take Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Throughout the current outbreak, he has promoted unproven treatments such as cod-liver oil and steroids. Experts widely agree that these are no substitutes for the measles vaccination. No antivirals will cure a patient once they’re infected—doctors can only manage the symptoms. Depending on certain factors (age, vaccination status, underlying conditions), in many cases these symptoms will abate; in others, possible complications (pneumonia, brain swelling) can lead to long-term issues or death.

“Measles is not a forgiving virus,” my colleague Katherine J. Wu wrote last month. And it’s currently spreading in an environment very different from that of the prevaccine era, when primarily kids were infected and people lived in a world less connected by air, rail, and car. 

The most recent example of a measles epidemic took place in the late 1980s and early ’90s. It “infected 55,000 people, put 11,260 in the hospital, and killed more than 150,” the policy researcher Mary Graham wrote in The Atlantic in 1993. Doctors scrambled to treat a disease they hadn’t come across for years; crowded hospitals set aside beds for feverish patients. “Epidemics are no longer local events,” Graham explained. “The rapid spread of measles to forty-nine states was a destructive reminder that from the perspective of a virus we have become one community.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744905973.0,Anti-Vaxxers Are Grifting Off the Measles Outbreak—and Claim a Bioweapon Caused It,"Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudo-scientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.

The claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge COVID-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.

“I’m not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I’m going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)

The webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.

“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there’s some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There’s always an ulterior motive.”

The community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.
Willis’s bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases, or in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The claims have been facilitated, in part, by Kennedy, whose response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by public health officials. Kennedy has seemingly attempted a balancing act in his response to this crisis, accurately saying the MMR vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles,” before undermining this statement days later by claiming, without evidence, that the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes by 5 percent every year.

Kennedy also praised doctors last month in an interview on Fox News who have been using alternative and unproven treatments within the Mennonite community. Among those doctors is Richard Bartlett, who also appeared on Willis’s webinar last week and is credited on the Rebel Lion site with sharing the measles “protocol” package for purchase.

“Not only are we going to talk to Dr. Bartlett about what’s happening and what he’s seen there on the front lines, but he’s also going to share what he’s been using and the protocols that he’s been using to treat his patients,” Willis said in the webinar.

On the webinar, Bartlett pushed unproven measles treatments like the steroid budesonide and the antibiotic clarithromycin. He also urged viewers to buy a range of pseudoscientific treatments. Along with mouthwash, supplemental oxygen, and a few other items, the measles protocol includes Rebel Lion’s own Fierce Immunity capsules, which cost $50 for a single bottle and contain a blend of five supplements available off the shelf that the company claims have been formulated with a supposed AI technology known as “Swarm Intelligence.” Swarm Intelligence was created by Anton Fliri, who says he has worked as a cancer researcher at Pfizer in the past. Fliri told Willis in a webinar last August that unlike regular AI, his technology “is the natural form of intelligence, that’s the way our brain works, that’s the way our body works and it doesn’t hallucinate because everything we are doing is based on reality, based on the real evidence.”

Willis, Bartlett, Rebel Lion, and Fliri, who also appeared on last week’s webinar, did not respond to requests for comment.

Willis’s attempt to cash in on an ongoing public health crisis is reminiscent of a strategy that has been playing out for decades in the anti-vaccine community and was seen most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Antivaccine influencers and groups like America’s Frontline Doctors pushed the baseless claim that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were viable treatments for COVID-19, encouraging followers to spend millions of dollars on these products.

From the very beginning of the measles outbreak in Texas, the anti-vaccine community has sought to undermine the threat posed by the disease, presenting false narratives about what caused the deaths and the dangers of the MMR vaccine.

Central to this push has been CHD. Within hours of the first child’s death reported in Lubbock, Texas on February 25, the Defender, CHD’s news publication, published an article citing several unsubstantiated text messages from medical professionals suggesting that the child had not died of measles.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744900999.0,"Vaccine advisory panel recommends expanded RSV use, and two new vaccines","A committee of independent vaccine experts voted Wednesday to recommend lowering the age at which adults can get a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, potentially opening up access to these vaccines for adults in their 50s who are at high risk of severe illness from RSV. 

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that any RSV vaccine for adults that is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for high-risk adults aged 50 to 59 be recommended for use in that age group. If the recommendation is accepted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which the ACIP advises — insurance companies will have to cover the cost of the vaccine for eligible individuals.

How quickly that might happen is unclear. ACIP recommendations must be approved by the director of the CDC, and at present, the agency does not have a director. Susan Monarez, who had been serving as acting director until she was proposed as the nominee for the position, has not yet been through the Senate confirmation process. 

A spokesperson said the CDC’s chief of staff Matthew Buzzelli would take receipt of the six recommendations from the committee that arose from Wednesday’s meeting. 

Jeremy Faust, a Boston emergency room physician and public health expert who writes the Substack column Inside Medicine, reported last week that legal experts say that in the absence of a CDC director, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could sign off on the committee’s recommendations.

In addition to the RSV vaccine vote, the committee also recommended use of a new meningococcal vaccine from GSK, a chikungunya vaccine from Bavarian Nordic, and voted to tweak a previous recommendation for another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. 

If accepted by the CDC, the vote on the use of RSV vaccines in people in their 50s would initially apply to vaccines sold by GSK and Pfizer. Moderna is in the process of applying to the FDA to extend the license for its RSV vaccine to include high-risk people aged 50 to 59, and the new policy — if approved — would cover it as well.

A cost analysis generated by the CDC and researchers from the University of Michigan suggested that use of these expensive vaccines in selected members of this age demographic could be cost saving. In particular, it was suggested that people who have undergone lung transplantation, or who have heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, or severe obesity should be considered for RSV vaccination in their 50s. 

Michael Melgar, a CDC vaccines researcher, said around 30% of U.S. adults aged 50 to 59 would qualify.

The present CDC recommendation for use of these vaccines in older adults is that anyone aged 75 and older should get the shot and anyone aged 60 to 74 who is at high risk of severe illness from RSV should too. The ACIP has been slow to recommend broader use of RSV vaccines for older adults because of a couple of concerns. [...] 

The committee also voted to recommend use of a new chikungunya vaccine, Vimkunya, for travelers and scientists who work on the chikungunya virus in laboratories. The vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, is licensed for use in people aged 12 and older. [...] 

The recommendation is that the vaccine can be used in people who are traveling to a country where an outbreak is underway. The committee further recommended that use of the vaccine could be considered in people who are traveling to a place where the risk of transmission is elevated, if the person will be staying in the location for a period of six months or longer.

The committee previously had recommended use of another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. The earlier recommendation had stressed use in people 65 and older, who are at increased risk of having serious illness if they contract the virus. 

But six reports of serious side-effects in older adults after vaccination — five of which required hospitalization — prompted the committee to amend that recommendation on Wednesday. While it did not recommend against use of the Valneva  in people 65 and older, the recommendation — if accepted, will feature a precaution about use of the vaccine in that age group. 

The committee also recommended use of GSK’s pentavalent — five in one — vaccine to protect against meningitis, MenABCWY, for people aged 16 to 23 for whom a vaccine protecting against meningitis B is recommended, and for people aged 10 and older at increased risk of developing meningococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744827422.0,"RFK Jr. says government to launch new studies on link between toxins, autism amid pushback","WASHINGTON- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is doubling down on his view that toxins in the environment contribute to autism with a series of new studies to investigate the issue as scientists continue to push back on his claims.

Speaking on April 16 at his first press conference since joining President Donald Trump's Cabinet, Kennedy also pushed back against criticism for describing an uptick in the neuro-developmental disorder among American children as as ""epidemic.""

""We're gonna announce a series of new studies to identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it,"" he said. ""This has not been done before.

Kennedy added that the results of the ""thorough and comprehensive"" study will be available to the ""American people very, very quickly.""

""This is coming from an environmental toxin and somebody made it and put that environmental toxin into our air or water or medicines or food,"" Kennedy said during the press conference at the Department of Health and Human Services' headquarters in Washington, D.C. ""And it's to their benefit to say, oh, to normalize it, to say, 'oh, this is all normal'.""

Researchers have been looking into the causes of autism for decades; the Centers of Diseases Control and Prevention says that some people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a genetic condition, but other causes are not yet known. The CDC also says many studies have looked at whether there is a connection between vaccines and autism and ""to date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with autism.""

In an April 15 report, the CDC found that in 2022, one in 31 children were diagnosed with autism by age 8 in the U.S., an uptick from one in 36 children in 2020. The prevalence of autism among boys was one in 20 and the 2022 rate is five times higher than it was in 2000.

While Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who has linked vaccines to autism, has characterized the increase in autism rates as an “epidemic running rampant,” the CDC researchers in the report have attributed it to “increased identification” among very young children and previously under-identified groups.

Kennedy recently set a September deadline for the U.S. National Institutes of Health to determine the cause behind the rise in autism rates. His announcement has been met with mixed reactions within the autism community, with some welcoming Kennedy's rhetoric and commitment to focusing on the disorder. 

The prevalence of the condition among 8-year-olds was higher among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black and Hispanic children than among white children, CDC data showed.

Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed based on challenges with social skills, communication and repetitive behaviors. It is a spectrum, meaning symptoms vary widely, with a percentage unable to communicate at all and others highly successful in some areas of life.

The data does not signal an “epidemic” but instead reflects diagnostic progress, said Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America.

""Claiming that autism is 'preventable' is not science-based, and places unnecessary blame on people, parents and families,"" Banks said. “It is not an epidemic, nor should it be compared to the COVID-19 pandemic, and using language like that perpetuates falsehoods, stigma and stereotypes.""

Kennedy said during the April 16 press conference there are many studies in the ""scientific literature that absolutely explode this mythology that this autism epidemic is not real.""

""It is absolutely indefensible to continue to promote this,"" he said.

The 2022 study was conducted across 16 sites in 14 states and Puerto Rico and surveyed children aged 8 years born in 2014.

The accord’s goal is to strengthen global collaboration to help prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemic threats. In 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic at a special WHA session, WHO member states established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) to draft and negotiate a pandemic accord. The group had 13 rounds of formal meetings and many informal sessions to iron out different aspects of the document. In a statement today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, thanked the team for its tireless work in forging a historic agreement. “In reaching consensus on the Pandemic Agreement, not only did they put in place a generational accord to make the world safer, they have also demonstrated that multilateralism is alive and well, and that in our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground, and a shared response to shared threats.”

Gaines County, which borders New Mexico, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, with 364 cases confirmed so far, DSHS data shows.

There have been two confirmed deaths linked to the outbreak, both of which occurred in unvaccinated school-aged children.

""Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak,"" the health department said.

As of Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 712 measles cases this year in at least 24 states: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.

At least five states including Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas are reporting outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases.

The CDC says 11% of measles patients in the U.S. this year have been hospitalized, the majority of whom are under age 19.

Among the nationally confirmed cases by the CDC, about 97% are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.

Of those cases, 1% are among those who have received just one dose of the MMR vaccine and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.

The CDC currently recommends that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. For measles prevention, one dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 due to the highly effective vaccination program, according to the CDC. However, CDC data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years.",1jzwmmn,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-linked-texas-outbreak-reach-561-20/story?id=120819175,187
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744749986.0,Translating what Kennedy's anti-vaccine allies hear in his response to the measles outbreak,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — When the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., endorsed the measles vaccine this month after an outbreak in Texas claimed the life of a second child, his comments made waves because he has spent 20 years making false claims that vaccines are unsafe.

Many of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine allies stood by him anyway, trying to tamp down concerns from others who accused Kennedy of abandoning their movement.

That’s because, according to doctors, public health experts and propaganda researchers who know Kennedy’s history well, the health and human services secretary is threading the needle between his agency’s role as a neutral arbiter of science and the rhetoric of anti-vaccine activists. They say his word choices reflect that he is working from the anti-vaccine playbook he has used for much of his career in public life.

Below, The Associated Press examines his comments about the measles outbreak that has infected more than 700 people nationwide and killed three, how his allies have interpreted them, and the facts according to scientists.

A Kennedy spokesperson said the health secretary is not anti-vaccine and had “responded to the measles outbreak with clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles.” He did not respond to questions about how Kennedy’s comments were being interpreted by his allies in the anti-vaccine movement.

**Endorsing vaccines, but then sowing doubt**

WHAT KENNEDY SAID: “The federal government’s position, my position, is people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS this month after an unvaccinated child in Texas died of measles.

Later, in the same interview, Kennedy raised safety concerns about the measles vaccine, saying testing was inadequate. He also raised safety concerns about the vaccine for pertussis.

WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Charlene Bollinger, who runs a business selling anti-vaccine videos and other products, highlighted in a Substack post how Kennedy had raised safety concerns.

In posts on X, she urged critics of his comments to “Trust him. Trust me. He’s not walked through fire for years to abandon us now,” then added, “Read what he said carefully and with a critical spirit ... pay attention to the things he didn’t say. There are clues.”

The group American Values, which was set up to support Kennedy’s presidential run, posted a thread on X that amplified Kennedy’s comments questioning vaccine safety. [...] 

READING BETWEEN THE LINES: If Kennedy had truly changed his mind about the benefits of vaccines, he would have explained what he got wrong in the past, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He didn’t do that and instead immediately questioned how vaccines are safety tested.

“If someone like RFK Jr. with his record were going to make an about-face on his position on the measles vaccine, you would expect an essay, an articulation of what he got wrong in the past. You’re not seeing that,” Adalja said. “The fact that he undercuts it almost immediately speaks to that.”

**Saying people who died of measles were ‘already sick’**

WHAT KENNEDY SAID: Health authorities have said the two children who died were both unvaccinated, that they died as a result of measles and that neither had any reported underlying conditions. But Kennedy suggested those who died during the outbreak were “people who were already sick.” He said the second child who died had various other health problems and asserted that “ the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.”

“Her death was caused by pneumonia,” Kennedy told Fox News. “So, you know, her parents said that she was over measles two weeks before.”

Kennedy’s spokesperson did not respond to questions asking where he got his information about the child’s medical history and to clarify why what he said conflicted with statements from health officials.

WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: The anti-vaccine group Kennedy led for years, Children’s Health Defense, promoted his comments, posting a clip online and saying it shows that Kennedy “confirms the so-called ‘measles deaths’ are NOT actually measles deaths.”

American Values wrote that his comments constituted a “bombshell” because the child “did not pass away from measles, despite what the media claimed.”

READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Kennedy’s comments suggesting measles didn’t kill the child reflect longstanding tactics used to create doubt about vaccines, said Renee DiResta, a professor at Georgetown University who researches propaganda and has studied the anti-vaccine movement. She said Kennedy and Children’s Health Defense have spent years telling people that measles is a routine and harmless childhood illness to justify the argument that a safe vaccine is somehow more risky than the disease.

“Reframing these deaths as something other than what they are – deaths from measles, which is not harmless at all – is necessary to prop up the dual pillars of anti-vaccine propaganda in play here,” she said.

It reflects a similar narrative that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people who wanted to minimize its seriousness suggested people were dying “with COVID” rather than from COVID, said Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside, who has closely followed Kennedy’s anti-vaccine work. It’s a way of minimizing the deadly nature of measles. 

**‘Standing with the unvaccinated’ and personal choice**

WHAT KENNEDY SAID: Kennedy attended the funeral of the 8-year-old girl who died, then posted online about meeting with her family and the family of a 6-year-old girl who died in February. In one post about the trip, he wrote that “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He also posted photos of himself with the families.

WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Kennedy’s positive comments about the measles vaccine prompted some criticism from his old group Children’s Health Defense. CEO Mary Holland said in a video that Kennedy no longer speaks for the group, and said he had put out what she called “very partial information.” She claimed that a vaccination for measles had caused her son’s autism. But she went on to praise Kennedy’s actions.

“People should not get lost in Bobby Kennedy saying that the vaccine can prevent measles,” Holland said, adding, “Bobby went to stand with the unvaccinated. And he has said it’s a personal choice.”

Children’s Health Defense and Bollinger have sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.

THE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: Scientists have ruled out any link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization, which says immunization has been the greatest contribution to ensuring babies live until their first birthday.

READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Carpiano said Kennedy helped the anti-vaccine movement pivot to the idea that it is about personal rights, personal freedoms and medical freedom. While there is a libertarian bent to it, that framing leaves out an important piece.

“It’s the freedom to do whatever you want. A libertarian would say, ‘provided it doesn’t hurt other people,’” he said. But when it comes to Kennedy and the anti-vaccine movement, the part about not hurting other people gets left out, Carpiano said. “And so basically becomes a tyranny of the minority,” Carpiano said. “It’s something that he helps to keep promoting and legitimating.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744729948.0,WHO tests pandemic response with Arctic ‘mammothpox’ outbreak,"The outbreak began when a team of scientists and documentary film-makers excavated the remains of a woolly mammoth in the frozen Arctic tundra.

Within weeks, ICUs were “overwhelmed” and health systems were struggling to cope. Some countries introduced contact tracing and “enforced quarantines,” while others took a more laissez-faire approach – and saw the “uncontrolled spread” of a dangerous new disease.

This is the all-too-familiar scenario that ministers from 15 countries around the world were faced with last week when they gathered to test their readiness for the next pandemic.

The desktop exercise, led from the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, was overseen by Dr Mike Ryan, the no-nonsense director of the agency’s Health Emergencies Programme.

It simulated an outbreak of “Mammothpox,” a deadly but fictional virus from the orthopox family, similar to smallpox (which killed an estimated half a billion people in the century before it was eradicated in 1980) and mpox, a dangerous variant of which is currently surging across central Africa.

The exercise documents, obtained by The Telegraph, give a rare insight into how the WHO and its member states might react and coordinate in the event of a new pandemic.

While the disease depicted was fictitious, the exercise was based on real science and imagines a paleontological dig for mammoths, sabretooth tigers, and other extinct creatures held in the permafrost going horribly wrong.

“Scientific research has demonstrated that ancient viruses can remain viable in permafrost for thousands of years,” says the WHO briefing document. “The thawing of permafrost due to climate change has raised concerns about the potential release of pathogens previously unknown to modern medicine.”

The virus was potentially lethal and fast-moving, participating health officials were told.

“Mammothpox disease is severe, with a mortality intermediate between Mpox and Smallpox,” say the papers.

Smallpox killed about 30 per cent of those it infected before its eradication. Mpox is much less lethal but is currently exacting a terrible toll, especially on young children in Africa.

“With modest transmissibility and minimal asymptomatic spread it is controllable”, they added, but only with “effective coordinated responses – similar to SARS or Mpox”.

The assembled officials were all told that a “multinational team of scientists” and a “film crew” were behind the outbreak. They had travelled into the Arctic to find Mammoth remains being exposed by the retreating permafrost.

In a scene reminiscent of the opening of the film Jurassic Park, the team discovered a “remarkably well-preserved” specimen and proceeded to thaw and analyse samples of its tissues on site.

They then returned to their respective countries, only to fall ill shortly after, “presenting with symptoms of a pox-like illness”.

Among the participants in the two-day simulation were representatives from Denmark, Somalia, Qatar, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine.

The United States and China did not take part.

Each country was given a “small piece of the puzzle” to test how well they would share information and collaborate to contain the spread of the virus.

In an echo of the Covid pandemic, one country was told that a symptomatic Arctic researcher had boarded a cruise ship carrying 2,450 passengers and 980 crew.

The vessel effectively became a petri dish for scientists, who gathered data as the virus moved from cabin to cabin, allowing them to calculate the virus’s reproduction or R number at between 1.6 and 2.3.

Qatar was told the virus was being spread through large social gatherings and in workplaces, while in Uganda all of its 22 cases were put down to “household transmission”.

The desktop exercise was held over two days but simulated the first three weeks of the outbreak.

On the second day of the exercise, participants were told that progress in holding back the virus was being hampered by politics and divergent contaminants strategies between states.

Some countries implemented “strict border controls, banned all international arrivals and restricted internal movement,” the document says. Others maintained “open borders with minimal restrictions,” relying instead on “contact tracing, isolation,and quarantine measures”. [...] 

Dr Nedret Emiroglu, a director in the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said the mammothpox scenario was designed to be “realistic with the ability to spread around the world”.

But the disease was also designed to be “controllable if countries worked together,” she told The Telegraph.

While Exercise Polaris was playing out, negotiations on a new “pandemic treaty” were continuing at the WHO.

After three years of arduous negotiations, including disagreements over plans for the distribution of drugs and vaccines, an agreement on the treaty could be reached as early as Tuesday, sources told The Telegraph. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744720344.0,China Reports 3 Additional H9N2 Cases,"Although all we get is a barebones report (see chart above), the latest Hong Kong Weekly Avian Influenza Report lists 3 new H9N2 infections (1 adult, 2 children) from 3 different provinces on the Mainland. 

Over the previous 6 months, China has reported an additional 13 cases (see here, here, and here), with well over 100 reported over the past decade (see FluTrackers list).  Most cases are mild, and seroprevalence studies suggest many cases may go undetected.

H9N2 is poorly controlled in Chinese poultry, despite the use of vaccines (see J. Virus Erad.: Ineffective Control Of LPAI H9N2 By Inactivated Poultry Vaccines - China), which has led to the creation and spread of numerous of genotypes.

H9N2 also reassorts with, and often enhances, other novel influenza viruses (including H7N9, H5N1, and H5N6), making it an important co-conspirator (see Vet. Sci.: The Multifaceted Zoonotic Risk of H9N2 Avian Influenza). 

Seven years ago, in EID Journal: Two H9N2 Studies Of Note, we looked at two reports which suggested that H9N2 continues to evolve away from current (pre-pandemic and poultry) vaccines and is potentially on a path towards better adaptation to human hosts.
 
While LPAI H9N2 is admittedly not at the very top of our list of pandemic concerns, the CDC has 2 different lineages (A(H9N2) G1 and A(H9N2) Y280) on their short list of influenza viruses with zoonotic potential (see CDC IRAT SCORE), and several candidate vaccines have been developed.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744658032.0,"A spray in a cow's nose could soon protect it, and people, from bird flu","It was a first for cows last March when the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the highly pathogenic avian flu virus H5N1 had been found in cattle. Since then, most of the 70 human cases of the disease in the U.S. have come from interaction with infected herds.

Now researchers from the University of Maryland and the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will work to head off infections in cows and people alike by developing a nasal vaccine to protect dairy cattle from bird flu with support from a $650,000 grant from the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Preventing transmission of the disease from cows to people lessens the chances it will evolve into a human virus that can be passed from person to person, infectious disease experts say.

Xiaoping Zhu, professor and chair of the University of Maryland's Department of Veterinary Medicine, along with collaborator Wenbin Tuo of the ARS, plan to use the grant funding to adapt the nasal spray technology they originally developed for COVID-19 and human influenza. The vaccine could also potentially be used in humans, if necessary, they said.

""Preventing the initial infection and spread of H5N1 in cows means reducing exposure to the virus for other mammals, dairy workers and the general public,"" Zhu said. ""And that is critical to managing the spread of bird flu.""

H5N1, the current strain of bird flu circulating around the U.S., is a moving target that not only kills wild birds and poultry, but has rapidly adapted to sicken other species beyond dairy cattle and humans to include domestic cats, foxes, raccoons and even seals.

Although only one person has died of the virus so far—a backyard chicken farmer in Louisiana—scientists are concerned that as more people are exposed to bird flu by animals, the more opportunities the virus has to mutate into an illness that could be transmitted between people, which is currently impossible.

In addition to being quick and easy to administer, Zhu and Tuo's nasal vaccine has other advantages. While injection-based vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, trigger immune cells in the blood, which then attack a virus once an infection starts, nasal vaccines go to the source of respiratory infections.

Zhu's and Tuo's vaccine delivers a protein to the nasal passages that blocks viruses from infecting cells in the respiratory tract and prevents infections from even starting. That greatly reduces the likelihood of humans and other animals contracting the H5N1 virus from cows.

The toll is still being counted: 188 children have died from flu so far this season, with final counts expected to rise as more death certificates are processed. Modeling has estimated that, in total, flu caused 45 million illnesses, 580,000 hospitalizations (including my little girl), and 25,000 deaths this season.

This wasn’t inevitable. Flu vaccination rates have dropped steadily since the pandemic—and this year, they were among the lowest we’ve seen.

What this means for you: Flu shouldn’t be on your mind. Flu vaccines will still be available next year; however, one question is whether they will be covered by insurance.

**Norovirus: still going strong—and now with fewer protections**

Norovirus—think nausea, throwing up, diarrhea—continues to have a really bad year. Levels are still above “average” for this time of year, largely driven by a new strain of the virus.

While most cases come from food outbreaks and household spread, we’ve had 10 cruise ship outbreaks in 2025 thus far. Unfortunately, the new administration fired the full-time CDC cruise ship inspectors for norovirus. The team was in the middle of responding to two outbreaks when they were let go.

This doesn’t save the federal government money. The team is funded through fees paid by cruise companies.

A much smaller team of 12 U.S. Public Health Service officers remains, but how they’ll keep up is unclear.

What this means for you: Norovirus is very contagious. It spreads through surfaces and can survive for weeks. Hand sanitizer doesn’t work—soap and water are your best bet. If you’re cruising anytime soon, wash your hands often and maybe skip the buffet. 

**Measles: a growing game of whack-a-mole**

The U.S. now has 739 measles cases—more than any year in the past 15—and outbreaks are spreading across multiple states. Five states now have more than 10 cases, a rare and concerning development.

The largest cluster is in the southern panhandle, with 643 cases:

Texas: 541 (+36 since the last update)

New Mexico: 58 (+2)

Oklahoma: 12 (+2)

Kansas: 32 (+8)

Colorado: 1 (likely linked)

Mexico’s outbreak—which was started with an unvaccinated 8-year-old who traveled to Texas—has surpassed 225 cases and is growing fast.

Four noteworthy updates on this outbreak:

Another death: An unvaccinated adult male died in the Mexico outbreak, bringing the death toll to four.

The exploitation continues: One RFK Jr.-promoted doctor was reportedly treating patients while actively infected with measles. The Children’s Health Defense (anti-vax non-profit started by Secretary Kennedy) was proud to report this development.

Urban spread begins: Lubbock and El Paso are now reporting increased cases—urban outbreaks are especially risky due to population density.

North American transmission chain? Genetic sequencing shows Mexico’s outbreak (and thus, the Texas outbreak) is the same strain as Ontario’s outbreak (>600 cases), raising the likelihood that this one outbreak is now circulating across North America.

In the past week, other sporadic cases have popped up due to travel across the country.

More than 500 flu-related deaths were reported for the 2024-25 respiratory virus season, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said in a Wednesday press release. The figure marked the highest statewide total since reporting began in 2009. [...] 

Flu-related deaths in the state were nearly on par with deaths caused by Covid-19, which is known to be a more severe illness than the flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC recorded approximately 600 Covid-19 deaths in the state between October and April.

According to the most recent epidemiological notice issued by the Ministry of Health, as of week 14 of 2025, 696 confirmed cases and 37 deaths have been recorded due to this highly contagious respiratory disease. 

Of the 2549 probable cases reported in the country, confirmed infections are distributed across 25 states. The states with the highest number of cases are: Chihuahua (77), Mexico City (74), Aguascalientes (69), and Nuevo León (62).

In the last week, 78 new cases of whooping cough were reported, with the State of Mexico being the most affected with 15 cases, followed by Mexico City (9), Coahuila (8), Jalisco (8), Zacatecas (6), and Veracruz (5). The increase is considerable compared to previous years. As of 1 Mar 2025, 288 cases had been confirmed, compared to only 19 during the same period in 2024. During 2023, 188 cases were reported, while in 2024 the preliminary figure closed at 463.

The lack of surveillance between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in whooping cough detection, but the current upswing demands greater attention.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744461120.0,Weekly measles cases top 90 in U.S. for first time in years,"The number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in a single week has topped 90 for the first time since a record wave in 2019, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ninety-one cases of measles were reported with rashes that began the week of March 23, with Arkansas, Hawaii and Indiana joining the list of two dozen states with confirmed measles cases.

For the week of March 30, 81 cases were reported, and another 21 cases were reported for the following week. But those figures are expected to rise as more cases are confirmed.

So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. — the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were reported in 1990, largely due to gaps in vaccination.

In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.

The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.

A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency previously said outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.

This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.

""Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that,"" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting. [...] 

Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, ""We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic.""

One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.

During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.

Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a letter to health departments this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.

The WHO members have reached an agreement ""in principle"" over how to tackle future pandemics after three years of discussions, the co-chair of the negotiating body told Agence France-Presse on Saturday.

According to the latest draft of the proposed pact, obtained by POLITICO, most of the text is now agreed.

Still to be signed off on is contentious language governing the sharing of technology for pandemic-related products such as drugs, vaccines and therapeutics.

Developing countries have pushed for strong language that will ensure they are able to scale up production in their own regions, rather than waiting in line for critical technologies.

But developed countries, including members of the European Union, have insisted throughout that any tech transfer from pharma companies must be on “voluntary and mutually agreed terms.”

Under the latest proposed fix, still subject to final confirmation, the sharing of technology should be “willingly undertaken and on mutually agreed terms.”

So far, 816 cases of the highly infectious disease have been associated with the outbreak, which health officials say began with a Mennonite community gathering in New Brunswick last fall. The outbreak in New Brunswick was declared over in January, but Ontario’s has continued to spread. It is the largest outbreak in the province since measles was considered eliminated in Canada in the 1990s.

Cases were originally centred around two health units in southwestern Ontario, but have now spread throughout the province, to 15 health units. There have been no cases in Ottawa, which is one of the only communities in the province that uses wastewater testing as a surveillance and early warning tool for measles. There have been 58 cases in the South East Health Unit, which includes Belleville, Kingston and surrounding areas. Southwestern Public Health, which includes Oxford County, Elgin County and St. Thomas, is the epicentre of the outbreak. So far it has had 328 measles cases, 40 per cent of the provincial total.

The majority of cases have been among infants, children and adolescents, most of them unvaccinated. Sixty-one cases associated with the outbreak have required hospitalization, six of them in intensive care. There have been no deaths associated with the outbreak.

There have been an additional 25 cases in Ontario since January that were not linked to the multi-jurisdictional outbreak. Some are connected with travel. In other cases no source has been identified. [...] ",1jx19bn,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/ontario-measles-outbreak-growing,112
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744390256.0,Robert F. Kennedy Jr. falsely claims measles vaccine protection 'wanes very quickly',"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn’t been “safety tested” and its protection is short-lived.

Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent the virus’ spread.

In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there are no approved treatments for measles, which kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.  

Many medical experts have taken issue with his approach to the current measles outbreak, which has included emphasizing unproven treatments and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters). 

**Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines — a notion doctors say is false.**

“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said.

Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That’s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.

“We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,” said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744399342.0,"Child, adult COVID survivors more likely to have heart disease, symptoms, data suggest","New studies from the United States and Poland detail COVID-19's cardiovascular toll, with one suggesting that infected children face significantly higher odds of conditions such as high blood pressure and heart failure and the other revealing that post-infection heart symptoms are common in adults.

**Even kids at low risk had higher rates of heart conditions**

A University of Pennsylvania–led research team used electronic health records from 19 US children's hospitals participating in the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) consortium to estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease 1 to 6 months after COVID-19 infection from March 2020 to September 2023, with at least 6 months of follow-up. 

Of the more than 1.2 million participants aged 0 to 20 years, 297,920 (24.6%; 13,646 with congenital heart defects [CHDs]) had COVID-19, and 915,402 (75.4%; 46,962 with CHDs) were uninfected controls. The average patient age was 7.8 years, and 51.4% were male.

The findings were published today in Nature Communications.

Relative to controls, children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at significantly greater risk for high blood pressure (1.5% vs 1.1% in controls), abnormal ventricular rhythms (0.9% vs 0.7%), myocarditis (0.1% vs 0.02%), heart failure (1.6% vs 1.2%), cardiomyopathy (0.6% vs 0.4%), cardiac arrest (0.5% vs 0.4%), thromboembolism (0.9% vs 0.7%), chest pain (1.2% vs 0.6%), and palpitations (0.4% vs 0.3%). 

The findings were similar in patients with and without CHDs, but those with CHDs had a higher risk of atrial fibrillation. Risks were consistent regardless of age, sex, race, obesity status, COVID-19 severity, and SARS-CoV-2 variant.

Overall, the CHD group had higher absolute risks of any post-COVID cardiovascular outcome than those without CHDs (5.6% for infected patients vs 4.0% for controls with CHD; 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively, in those without CHD).

""Even children and adolescents without a history of any cardiovascular outcomes before SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks, suggesting a broad potential impact on those previously considered at low risk of cardiovascular disease,"" the study authors wrote. 

""Awareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to timely referrals, diagnostic evaluations, and management to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents,"" they added.

**No difference on cardiac testing**

The second study, published this week in BMC Infectious Diseases followed up with 1,080 adult participants from a COVID-19 registry in Poland after infection with a pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant or Omicron up to January 2022. 

A follow-up visit at 3 to 6 months post-infection consisted of symptom monitoring and testing with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), Holter electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. A total of 504 patients also took the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) test and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) starting in June 2022.

The average patient age was 56.9 years, 68.9% were women, 75.2% were vaccinated against COVID-19, 53.1% were infected during Omicron predominance, 44.4% had high blood pressure (hypertension), and 18.0% had abnormal cholesterol levels.

At least one of the analyzed symptoms was noted in 586 patients (54.3%, including patients with any COVID-19 severity), indicating cardiac long COVID; those without cardiac symptoms served as controls. The most common symptom was fatigue (38.9%). Palpitations occurred in 17.6% of patients, and 1.8% reported fainting episodes. Nearly half of patients had only one cardiac symptom (45.7%), while 0.6% had all investigated symptoms.

Patients with palpitations had stronger premature ventricular contractions than those without palpitations, but they also had lower average systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The comparative analysis of adults with and without cardiac long COVID showed no differences on ABPM, Holter ECG, or echocardiography. The lack of difference may be due to the asymptomatic nature of some cardiac complications and a too-short follow-up to allow cardiac damage to be reflected on standard cardiovascular tests, the researchers said.

**Link between mental illness, cardio symptoms**

Patients with cardiac symptoms had higher scores on the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 and higher percentages of responses indicating increased risk of anxiety or depression. In this group, 290 (57.4%) reported one or more analyzed symptoms. Patients with PHQ-2 scores of at least 3 had higher heart rates.

Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms.
Potential mechanisms linking mental illness to cardiovascular symptoms in long-COVID patients may include chronic inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction, the authors said. 

""Prolonged stress and anxiety can lead to elevated cortisol levels, which may exacerbate hypertension and arrhythmias,"" they wrote. ""Additionally, shared pathways such as oxidative stress and immune dysregulation could further explain the interplay between these conditions, which is critical for developing holistic and integrated treatment strategies.""

Risk factors for cardiac long COVID were female sex, asthma, and COVID-19 vaccination.

""Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms,"" the authors advised. ""Clinical practice should also include broad patient education, informing them about potential cardiovascular symptoms after COVID-19 infection, regardless of the dominant variant, and emphasizing the importance of early reporting of any concerning symptoms.""

April 10, 2025

Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed another unorthodox view on vaccines, with the long-time vaccine critic declaring that vaccines for respiratory bugs that target a sole part of the pathogen they are meant to protect against do not work.

The claim was dismissed as erroneous by vaccine experts, who were befuddled by the secretary’s theory, espoused during an interview with CBS News. 

**Kennedy made the claim in explaining a controversial recent decision by political appointees at the Food and Drug Administration to delay granting a full license to Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine**, which is still given under an emergency use authorization or EUA. 

“It is a single antigen vaccine. And for respiratory illnesses, the single antigen vaccines have never worked,” Kennedy said when asked by CBS’s chief medical correspondent, Jonathan LaPook, why the decision was delayed. 

Scientists who have developed and studied vaccines were blunt in their assessment of Kennedy’s claim.

**“He’s wrong,” said Paul Offit**, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who was one of the developers of a successful rotavirus vaccine. “He believes falsely that a single protein vaccine can’t effectively prevent a serious mucosal infection and of course it can. We have several examples.”

Peter Marks, the former head of the FDA’s biologics center, which regulates vaccines, said Kennedy’s idea about single antigen vaccines isn’t based in science. 

“A tenet of virology is that you go after one of the proteins on the surface that generates a good immune response, and that’s what you target. This principle has withstood the test of time because we’ve made multiple good vaccines in that manner,” said Marks, who was pushed out of the FDA late last month at the behest of Kennedy. 

**“This is another example of Kennedy being an ignoramus about vaccination, if not other things as well. And you can quote me on that,” said Stanley Plotkin**, a co-developer of the rotavirus vaccine and of the vaccine that protects against rubella. Plotkin is a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania.

An antigen is a substance that activates the immune system to protect against a specific disease threat. Some vaccines, such as the one that protects against measles, target multiple parts of the pathogen they are designed to stave off. 

But others focus on a sole protein. All Covid vaccines target a single antigen, a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known as the spike protein. Most flu vaccines effectively target a single antigen, the hemagglutinin protein on the exterior of flu viruses. And vaccines against respiratory syncytial viruses are also single antigen vaccines, targeting RSV’s F protein.

In addition to puzzling experts, **Kennedy’s statement could bode poorly for multiple Covid vaccines currently under review. They are made by Novavax, Moderna, and Pfizer, along with its partner BioNTech.**

Beyond the pending Novavax approval, the FDA must in the coming weeks advise Covid vaccine manufacturers on how to update their shots for the 2025-2026 respiratory season. 

The agency is also studying applications from Moderna and Pfizer to have their pediatric Covid vaccines given full licenses — known in the industry as BLAs. Though Pfizer’s and Moderna’s adult Covid vaccines were long ago issued BLAs, the pediatric formulations are still being used under EUAs.

And the agency must decide by May 31 whether to approve a next-generation Covid shot that has been developed by Moderna. 

Financial markets appeared to take notice of Kennedy’s single antigen claim, with Novavax’s stock price dropping 20% and Moderna’s falling 8% at a point on Thursday.

**Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said Kennedy’s comment makes him worried, both about the continued availability of the Novavax vaccine in this country, but also for Covid vaccines in general.**

“I think any single antigen vaccine based on his rhetoric right now has to be considered at risk,” Osterholm said.

Marks shared that concern.

 “Our children, our older people in this country, for that matter, all of us deserve the best available vaccines that come through the gold standard evaluation process for quality, safety and effectiveness from the Food and Drug Administration without any political interference,” he told STAT in an interview. Marks said political interference in vaccine approvals could be “disastrous” as it could prevent products that would protect people from being used. Plotkin too is worried about Kennedy’s reach into the FDA’s decision-making process.

“Obviously, if Kennedy is making decisions, that is going to hurt vaccine development. And more specifically, if decisions have to be made and those decisions are delayed or changed, then the public will suffer because [they] will not be made based on scientific decisions,” he said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744332406.0,What RFK Jr. Told Grieving Texas Families About the Measles Vaccine,"On Sunday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with the families of two girls who had died from measles in West Texas—and raised doubts about the safety of vaccines. “He said, ‘You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,’” Peter Hildebrand, whose 8-year-old daughter, Daisy’s, funeral had been held just hours earlier, told me. “I actually asked him about it.”

The secretary of Health and Human Services had traveled to the small, remote city of Seminole, where 1,000 mourners for Daisy filled the wooden pews of an unmarked Mennonite church. After the service, coffee and homemade bread were served at a traditional gathering known as a faspa. Kennedy was there, he wrote on X that afternoon, to “console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief.”

The slow-brewing crisis, in which more than 600 people have been infected with measles and three have died—America’s first deaths from the disease in a decade—has left Kennedy in an awkward position. For many years, he has been the country’s most prominent anti-vaccine activist. Americans “have been misled by the pharmaceutical industry and their captured government agency allies into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective,” he wrote in a foreword to a 2021 book. Since taking office, though, he has moderated his tone, at times endorsing the shots’ importance to public health. In his public post from Seminole, Kennedy did so once again, describing his department’s efforts to supply Texas pharmacies and clinics with “needed MMR vaccines,” which he called “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.”

Yet there’s ample reason to believe that Kennedy hasn’t really changed his views: “I have worked with Bobby for many years, and I can confidently say that he has a heart that is incapable of compromise,” Del Bigtree, the communications director for Kennedy’s independent presidential campaign, said on X, in an effort to reassure some angry and confused supporters. “He is at a poker table with the slyest serpents in the world,” he added; “we should not ask him to show his cards.” (Bigtree also called the MMR vaccine “one of the most effective ways to cause autism,” despite the fact that study after study has disproved the link.) Indeed, when I spoke with Hildebrand by phone on Monday, I learned that Kennedy was questioning vaccines behind the scenes, even in the midst of his condolence trip to Texas.

“He never said anything about the vaccine being helpful,” Hildebrand told me. He did not want to go into more detail about his conversation with Kennedy, saying he’d been advised (he didn’t say by whom) not to make any public comments. But he seemed to view the secretary’s statement as confirmation that the MMR vaccine is untrustworthy. Notwithstanding his daughter’s death, he claimed that the children of another member of his family, who were vaccinated, still got sicker in the recent outbreak than two of his own children who had gotten measles and recovered. “So the vaccine ain’t about shit,” he said. A Health and Human Services spokesperson would not confirm what Kennedy had said to Hildebrand. “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine, he is pro-safety,” the spokesperson wrote by email. “He has consistently made that clear.”

Among vaccine skeptics, the death of Daisy Hildebrand, like the earlier death of 6-year-old Kayley Fehr, is being reframed as the consequence of a tragic and egregious medical error. Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded, has pushed the theory that Fehr wasn’t given the correct antibiotic for pneumonia soon enough to save her life, apparently basing that judgment on medical records the Fehrs provided to the organization. Covenant Children’s Hospital, where Fehr was treated, has called such claims “misleading and inaccurate,” while pointing out that patient-confidentiality laws prevent the hospital from going into detail about the girl’s treatment. Robert Malone, a doctor and former researcher known for sharing concerns—and misinformation—about COVID-19 vaccines, posted on his Substack that Daisy’s death was “a case of a child suffering from pre-existing conditions who was misdiagnosed.” (Texas’s health department says that the girl had “no reported underlying conditions.”)

Hildebrand, too, blames doctors for the deaths. “I’m willing to do any- and everything I can to make sure the hospitals start getting some ‘act right’ in them so nobody else has to go through this,” he said. “They pretty much murdered them.” In the case of his daughter, he believes the hospital should have given her budesonide, a steroid often prescribed for asthma, among other conditions, that has been touted by Kennedy for treating measles. “They didn’t give her the budesonide breathing treatment that we’d been asking for,” Hildebrand said. “They were saying that the IV steroids they were giving her were better.” A spokesperson for University Medical Center in Lubbock didn’t respond to a request for comment.
According to Michael Mina, a physician and an immunologist who studies measles, budesonide is not a first-line treatment for measles. “The use of budesonide to try to treat measles simply does not, biologically or mechanistically, make sense,” Mina told me. “Where it could potentially make sense is treating a co-infection that’s occurring in conjunction with measles, but that is far from a measles therapy. This is not something that we should be treating measles with.” Mina added that it is “much better to prevent measles in the first place through vaccination.”

Hildebrand said that, before they took Daisy to the hospital, his family was given advice on her care by, among others, Ben Edwards and Richard Bartlett, two West Texas doctors whom Kennedy has praised as “extraordinary healers” treating measles patients in Seminole. Edwards and Bartlett are pictured in a photo that Kennedy posted from his meeting with the two families, which occurred after the funeral at a steak dinner at the West Texas Living Heritage Museum, in Seminole. Like Kennedy, Edwards has raised doubts about the safety of the MMR vaccine and instead promoted treatments such as cod-liver oil, which is high in vitamins A and D. At one point, he was offering free cod-liver oil to Seminole residents at an ad hoc clinic next to a coffee shop.

Hildebrand said his family had been in touch with Bartlett and Edwards. Daisy was given vitamin A. “It all seemed to work,” he told me. “When she started needing oxygen so bad, we didn’t have the equipment at home, and neither did they have all the equipment at their clinics, so obviously we had to look for further help at the hospital.” In an email, Edwards denied that Daisy Hildebrand was one of his patients. “No, I did not treat her, but plan to get the medical records to review to see if standard of care was followed or not,” he wrote. “As you know, standard of care antibiotics were not given to the first little girl that died, which lead [sic] directly to her death.” Bartlett could not be reached for comment; a clinic where he used to work said he was no longer employed there.

Dean Boyer, the funeral director who handled the services for both girls, was present at the dinner where Kennedy met with the Hildebrands and Fehrs. He said he overheard the secretary’s conversations with both sets of parents. “He never asked pointed questions: Are you vaccinated? Are you not? He just told them how sorry he was,” Boyer told me. “He even met with the kids alone, just sat—a ‘pawpaw minute’ is what I called it.” Boyer praised Kennedy for attempting to keep his visit under wraps. “He tried to get in as quiet as he could, because he didn’t want attention.”

It’s true that Kennedy mostly dodged reporters, but of course his trip was not a secret. After the dinner, he posted a long message on X about the “warmth and love” he felt from the community and about how he had “bonded with many of these resilient, hardworking, resourceful, and God-loving people.” He also shared several photos of himself embracing the families, one with a boy on his knee, another with his arm around Hildebrand. Whereas some of Kennedy’s earlier comments about the outbreak have seemed callous—calling it “not unusual,” for instance, or suggesting without evidence that Kayley Fehr might have been malnourished—these conveyed the image of a government official who cared.

When I spoke with Hildebrand, he said he didn’t know that the secretary had posted photos of his family, or that Kennedy had given out Daisy’s full name. He said that he hadn’t wanted “any of this on the internet from the get-go,” but he didn’t blame Kennedy. Instead, he directed his ire at reporters. “Most of y’all are fake media, and I don’t need my daughter’s name out there to be reported crap on,” he told me. “I just don’t need anybody talking negative about my daughter. She’s in the ground.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744314255.0,Alberta's measles case counts climb with central zone hardest hit,"*19 new cases in 3 days but no commitment from health minister that top doctor will speak publicly*

Alberta is reporting a surge of new measles cases this week, sparking fresh calls for the provincial government to provide more detailed data and for the province's top doctor to appear publicly.

But even as the pressure mounts, health minister Adriana LaGrange is not offering any clear sense about when the chief medical officer of health might speak directly to Albertans about the situation.

The province confirmed nine new cases on Monday, seven additional cases on Tuesday, and another three on Wednesday, bringing the total confirmed during this year's outbreaks to 46.

While outbreaks span all five health zones, the central zone is now the hot spot for transmission, with 22 cases confirmed so far.

As of Tuesday, six Albertans had been hospitalized since the surge began, according to Alberta Health.

""It unfortunately shows that this disease, not only is it highly infectious, it's severe,"" said Dr. Cora Constantinescu, a pediatrician and infectious diseases specialist working at Alberta Children's Hospital.

Alberta's hospitalization rate, according to Constantinescu, appears similar to that in other jurisdictions with measles outbreaks.

""When you think about the fact that one out of 10 children are going to end up in hospital with this disease, that's a big deal,"" she said.

""It's a big concern for that family [and] for that child.""

The vast majority of Alberta's confirmed cases — 42 out of 46 to date — have been in those under the age of 18.

Alberta's growing wave of cases comes just after Texas reported the death of a second unvaccinated child due to measles. [...] 

The Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association wants the government of Alberta to immediately provide regular measles updates and release a plan to increase vaccination rates to 95 per cent, the level needed to protect against community transmission.

""I'd like to see the government come out with a strong message for everyone to get immunized,"" said Dr. Richard Owen, president of the Edmonton zone association.

 The Alberta government website states two doses of the measles vaccines offers nearly 100 per cent protection.

The Edmonton association is also calling on the province to beef up the data it makes available to the public — modelling it after the respiratory virus dashboard, which provides detailed information about influenza, COVID-19 and RSV.

""There seems to be a sense that this is being downplayed by the government … and I think it's worthy of a more honest response,"" said Owen, an Edmonton-based radiologist.

As CBC News reported last week, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Mark Joffe, has not appeared publicly since the outbreaks began. 

""Is there something to hide? Why would the chief medical officer not be able to speak about a major outbreak … of a disease that was essentially eradicated in Canada?"" said Owen.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, in 1998 the virus was considered ""eliminated"" in Canada because endemic transmission was no longer taking place.

While Alberta Health Minister LaGrange insisted on Tuesday that key efforts are underway to rein in the outbreaks, she stopped short of committing to an appearance by Alberta's top doctor.

""When Dr. Joffe feels that's important for him to do, he will absolutely go out and do it. But right now, he feels it's important to work with the local medical officers of health and the local communities to make sure that those individuals — those communities — are getting the information and the support that they need,"" said LaGrange.

When asked whether Joffe would be allowed to speak publicly if he wants to, she did not answer.

A statement provided by Alberta Health last week said the current response was considered ""appropriate"" and ""should the situation escalate, and a provincewide outbreak is declared, we anticipate Dr. Joffe speaking more broadly to Albertans.""

LaGrange said Joffe is in constant communication with public health officials in all five health zones.

""[He's] working with all of  the medical officers of health to make sure that the information is getting out there,"" she said, adding the province has launched a measles information campaign.

>“The numbers continue to grow by the day, but … the growth rate has diminished substantially,” Kennedy told reporters during a press conference, while promoting his health agenda through the American south-west.

>Public health experts have said that, in fact, there is little evidence to support this claim.

>“I would compare it to what’s happening in Europe now,” Kennedy continued, according to Politico. “They’ve had 127,000 cases and 37 deaths. And so, what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”

>Kennedy appeared to reference figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) released in March. In that instance, global health officials were referring to cases across 53 countries in Europe and central Asia, which make up the WHO’s “European region”. Included in that tally are nations such as Romania and Kazakhstan, which together account for nearly 60,000 cases.

>“Measles is the most contagious illness that we know of and it is preventable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director of the American Public Health Association. “What we’re seeing now… is a far, far undercount in terms of the actual number of cases.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744286375.0,WHO: SEAR Epidemiological Update On H5N1 In India (via Avian Flu Diary),"It's been just over a week since the flurry of media reports on the death of a toddler in Andhra Pradesh, India from the H5N1 virus (see Apr 2nd's Media Reports Of Fatal H5N1 Case in Child In Andhra Pradesh, India).

>While many of these media reports cite `government sources', over the past week I've not been able to find any confirmation published on an official government website.  

The official X/Twitter  account for Health, Medical & Family Welfare Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh is quite active, with scores of updates for the month of April, but with no mention of H5N1. 

Their webpage (https://hmfw.ap.gov.in/) has links for Notifications and News/Media, but none of them appear to work, and their (COVID centric) Facebook page hasn't been updated since Sept 2022.

>Similarly, searches of the Government of India Press Information Bureau (in both English & Hindi) turn up no mention of this case, and only two press releases mentioning H5N1 (here, and here) this month.  Several other Indian govt sites were simply unresponsive despite multiple attempts to access them.

Sadly, this game of hide and seek with official data isn't unusual, and it isn't just from India (see From Here To Impunity).  Our ability to track individual spillovers and outbreaks continues to deteriorate as more and more countries decide there is little to gain by releasing detailed information.

Yesterday the WHO released their latest SEAR (South-East Asia Region) Epidemiological report, which included a section on H5N1 in India (as of April 5th).  **I must assume that the WHO has not yet been officially notified of this case, since there is no mention of any human infections.**

This WHO summary only captures some of the spillovers reported to WOAH since the first of the year (see partial list below).

One example: While only two cats are mentioned in this report, on February 20th WOAH published a report on 99 infected cats (18 deaths) in Chhindwara, India.

Two days later (Feb 24th) we looked at a preprint on feline infections in Chhindwara with a triple-reassortant H5N1 virus (see Preprint: HPAI A (H5N1) Clade 2.3.2.1a Virus Infection in 2 Domestic Cats, India, 2025).

>While I've no doubt we'll eventually get an update on this latest human case from India via the WHO, **it is disconcerting how much H5N1 activity there appears to be in India, and how few details we are privy to.**

Of course we've heard no updates since the initial announcement of the UK's human H5 infection in January, or on the UK's H5N1 infected Sheep reported more than 2 weeks ago.  H5N1 reports have slowed markedly here in the United States since January, and many countries remain completely silent on the threat. 

>Two weeks ago we looked a scathing report on the delays (months, sometimes even > 1 year) by countries submitting H5N1 sequence data to GISAID (see Nature: Lengthy Delays in H5N1 Genome Submissions to GISAID).

While I have no way to accurately quantify how much we aren't hearing about H5N1, it is a pretty good bet it is substantial. And this silence extends far beyond just H5N1 (see Flying Blind In The Viral Storm).

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744232520.0,"Kansas, 2 other states report more measles cases","Health officials in Kansas today reported six more measles cases, bringing the total in the state's growing outbreak to 32 and adding to the national total.

The outbreak, which began on March 13, is centered in eight counties in the southwestern corner of the state, according to the update from Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE). Of the 32 case-patients, 27 are unvaccinated, 2 are pending verification, and 1 has unknown vaccination status. Twenty-six cases are in children and adolescents under 17. One patient has been hospitalized. 

KDHE officials say that because of the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases in the outbreak area are likely.

Kansas is one of 21 US states that have reported measles cases in 2025, which has now seen more than twice as many cases as all of last year, when 285 cases were reported. It's only the third year since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated in the United States, with more than 500 cases. At the current rate, it appears that the number of US measles cases will likely surpass the 1,274 reported in 2019.

The vast majority of measles cases have occurred in Texas, where an outbreak that originated in an unvaccinated Mennonite community in the western part of the state has topped 500 cases, and resulted in two deaths in unvaccinated children.

**Patients in Colorado, Hawaii unvaccinated**

Yesterday officials in Colorado confirmed its third measles case this year, in an adult with unconfirmed vaccination status. 

""This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,"" Rachel Herlihy, MD, MPH, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in a press release. ""We urge Coloradans to monitor for symptoms if they may have been exposed, and to make sure they are up to date on their MMR vaccinations.""

In Hawaii, officials with the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated child under 5 years of age on Oahu that appears to be linked to recent international travel. A household member with similar symptoms is also being evaluated for a possible measles infection.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 97% of US measles cases in 2025 have been in individuals who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. While two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, growing vaccine hesitancy in the United States has resulted in a decline in uptake of the vaccine. 

Data reported by the CDC last year show that during the 2023-2024 school year, MMR vaccine coverage among US kindergartners fell to 92.7%. But a new report from healthcare analytics company Truveta suggests that figure is even lower, finding that only 80.4% of US children had received both MMR doses by age 6 in 2024. Maintaining measles elimination status requires vaccination coverage of 95% or higher.

**Outbreaks in Mexico, Canada**

Meanwhile, US neighbors to the north and south are also dealing with growing measles outbreaks.

According to the most recent surveillance report from the Canadian government, 615 measles cases have been reported in six jurisdictions in Canada as of March 22. Of these cases, 538 are linked to an outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024. Ninety-three percent of the case-patients are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.

From 1998 to 2024, Canada averaged 91 measles case a year, with spikes in 2011 (751 cases) and 2014 (418).

Officials with the Macomb County Health Department Michigan said last week that an adult county resident with a confirmed measles infection recently traveled to Ontario.

In Mexico, officials with the Ministry of Health have reported 126 confirmed and 934 probable measles cases, according to a post on ProMED Mail. Most of the confirmed cases (121) are in Chihuahua.

Toronto Public Health says about 10,000 students are not up to date on their vaccinations, and an initial group of 173 students in Grade 11 will be suspended Tuesday.

A total of 574 students were sent suspension orders, which will continue to roll out across Toronto high schools until May.

TPH says students can avoid suspension and return to school by showing proof of vaccination or completing a valid exemption.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, expects ""compliance will exceed 90 per cent"" after all the notices are sent out.

""Toronto Public Health's goal is to help students catch up on their vaccinations and avoid missing school, and it continues to offer support to improve immunization coverage across the city,"" Dubey said in a statement on Tuesday.

Ottawa Public Health says approximately 15,000 notices of incomplete immunization records were handed out to students in mid-January, and suspensions are taking place from March to May. In Waterloo, more than 1,600 students were suspended last week. [...] 

**Ontario urged to set up electronic registry**

Under the Immunization of School Pupils Act, students must be vaccinated against various diseases including measles, whooping cough and tetanus.

However, most people in the province still track their shots on paper, which the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee is encouraging the Ministry of Health to change. [...]

The Townsville Hospital and Health Service patient is the 26th person to die with melioidosis in Queensland this year. 

The death was recorded in the latest melioidosis data released by Queensland Health. 

The government health department recorded 10 new cases in the last seven days. 

The death in Townsville was one of four new local cases.

In the Cairns health service region, four cases were recorded. 

One case was detected in the Mackay health service area and another in Queensland's north west region. 

Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by a bacteria found in water or soil. 

Cases often surge during the wet season after heavy rain or flooding. 

**More cases expected**

Townsville recorded its wettest year on record on Saturday with more than 2,419.8 millimetres falling so far in 2025.

Robert Norton, a microbiologist who recently retired from Townsville Hosptial and Health Service, said it had been an extraordinary wet season. 

""I'm not surprised there have been a lot of cases and sadly deaths as well,"" Dr Norton said. 

Even though widespread heavy rain had eased in Townsville, Robert Norton said cases would continue locally for weeks. 

""The soil will be sodden, there will be a lot of groundwater for a long time,"" he said. 

Dr Norton said the infection had a 15 per cent mortality rate in Australia so more cases of melioidosis meant more deaths. 

Queensland Health said people with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer, lung or kidney disease were more at risk of becoming sick with melioidosis.

Treatment involves strong antibiotics, and patients who become very sick are often hospitalised in intensive care. 

The bacteria can enter the body through skin cuts and sores as well as inhalation or by drinking contaminated water. 

There is no vaccine to prevent melioidosis but avoiding contact with soil or muddy water is encouraged. ",1jvc4lw,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-09/melioidosis-death-toll-rises-queensland-wet-season/105155546,11
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744111643.0,"RFK Jr stayed silent on vaccine, says father of child who died from measles","A Texas man who buried his eight-year-old daughter on Sunday after the unvaccinated child died with measles says Robert F Kennedy Jr “never said anything” about the vaccine against the illness or its proven efficacy while visiting the girl’s family and community for her funeral.

“He did not say that the vaccine was effective,” Pete Hildebrand, the father of Daisy Hildebrand, said in reference to Kennedy during a brief interview on Monday. “I had supper with the guy … and he never said anything about that.”

Hildebrand’s remarks came in response to a question about the national health secretary’s publicized visit to Daisy’s funeral. It was also after Kennedy issued a statement in which he accurately said: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” which also provides protection against mumps and rubella.

Kennedy, an avowed vaccine skeptic helming the Trump administration’s response to a measles outbreak that has been steadily growing across the US, then undermined that conventional messaging by soon publishing another statement that lavished praise on a pair of unconventional practitioners who have eschewed the two-dose MMR shot in favor of vitamins and cod liver oil.

The comments from Hildebrand provided a glimpse into how Kennedy simply demurred on vaccines – rather than express a position on them – during his first visit to the center of an outbreak that as of Monday had claimed three lives.

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1744147726.0,The American Plan to Eliminate Vaccines: The hiring of David Geier by the U.S. government to study if vaccines cause autism is another step toward getting rid of immunizations altogether,"Jonathan Jarry M.Sc. | 4 Apr 2025

We don’t defend the things we take for granted. Vaccines have long been victims of their own success, but only insofar as too many people were hesitant to get them. But what if vaccines were eliminated altogether?

It’s hard to ring the alarm these days without sounding mad. The eradication of vaccines from the United States? It may seem farfetched to people who don’t pay attention to the Trump administration’s actions vis-à-vis public health, but the recent announcement that David Geier is to be a senior data analyst on a study of vaccines and autism commissioned by the American federal government is one more step toward eliminating one of humanity’s scientific triumphs.

Vaccines do not cause autism. I have recently written about how we know that vaccines are safe. You can also spend a day reading the many, many credible papers answering this question. The debate has been put to rest by the scientific community and is being kept on life support by activists who deny the consensus on this issue. They will often prop up bad studies birthed by anti-vaxxers. The problem for their credibility is that these studies do not emanate from the government of the most powerful country on Earth.

This is about to change.

**Dumpster diving at the CDC**

You would expect an organization called the Institute of Chronic Diseases to occupy a large glass building on a university campus, filled with people dressed in white lab coats. But the nonprofit’s yearly tax filings since 2013 show one name running the show: Dr. Mark Geier. Under “Compensation of five highest-paid employees,” we read a single word: NONE.

The self-described institute was led by Dr. Mark Geier, who according to RFK Jr’s anti-vaccine organization, Children’s Health Defense, passed away a few weeks ago. On paper, he looked like a legitimate physician-researcher: a bachelor’s degree in zoology, a doctorate in genetics, and a medical degree, all from George Washington University in D.C. His obituary on the site lists various affiliations as diplomat and co-founder of a few scientific and medical endeavours, and it notes that he is survived by “his son and tennis partner,” David.

While his father’s credentials are impressive, David’s are much shorter (and he should not be confused with Dr. David Geier, an orthopaedic surgeon). He has neither doctorate nor medical degree, but a bachelor’s of arts in biology and a few graduate-level classes. Why would David Geier be recruited by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on whether or not vaccines cause autism? Because Kennedy is not driven by curiosity but by his preexisting belief that vaccines are responsible for autism.

Pseudoscience is often steered by confirmation bias, where the conclusion comes first and the evidence must follow, otherwise it is rejected. Cherry-picking allows for small, skewed studies to be heralded as definitive proofs, while larger, rigorous trials are dismissed as coming from corrupt sources. David Geier was chosen because he will deliver the conclusion Kennedy already believes in.

Mark and David Geier have a long history of unethical research practices, the most amusing example of which may be the 2017 retraction of a paper they co-authored and which argued that conflicts of interest may explain why most studies on the vaccine-autism link failed to find an association. The twist? On top of a number of errors, the Geiers’ paper had failed to disclose, wait for it, their own conflicts of interest on this topic, chief among them that some of the paper’s authors were involved in litigation related to vaccines and autism. Indeed, the Geiers were picked as expert witnesses in hundreds of vaccine-related lawsuits, though many judges dismissed the pair for being unqualified.

But the most salient of these breaches of ethics may be what the two did in late 2003, early 2004. They had received ethics approval to go to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and access information from their Vaccine Safety Datalink, which collects data on vaccination and health outcomes. On their first visit, they tried to perform analyses of the data that had not been approved for their research project. On their second visit, they attempted to merge data files to create more complete medical records, thus increasing the risk of a breach of confidentiality, and they renamed files for removal which were not allowed to be removed. Conspiracy theorists will claim the CDC was trying to keep information secret; clinical researchers, however, know that large datasets filled with identifiable information should only be used by researchers according to strict rules. Imagine a scientist going through your own medical records willy-nilly and unsupervised, violating their own ethics-approved protocol because they’re on a mission to document something that doesn’t exist.

Now imagine David Geier being given access to an even larger dataset and receiving permission by the anti-vaxxer-in-chief to find a connection between autism and vaccines. That’s what’s on the horizon.

Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist who has devotedly tracked the modern anti-vaccine movement over the decades, calls the motivated trawling of large health databases by anti-vaccine activists “dumpster diving.” This activity is now mandated by the U.S. government.

The Geiers’ dumpster diving at the CDC, however, is just the tip of a disturbing iceberg. I haven’t even mentioned the chemical castration of autistic children.

**The testosterone-mercury hypothesis**
 
The Institute of Chronic Illnesses has its own institutional review board tasked with evaluating and approving or denying research projects involving human participants. In 2007, this board was denounced as consisting of David Geier; Mark Geier, his wife, and two of his business associates; and the mother of an autistic child who was a patient and research participant of Mark Geier’s, and the mother of another child with autism who was a plaintiff in three pending vaccine-injury claims. It should go without saying that the scientist submitting a research proposal to an ethics committee and his buddies should not sit on said committee. It turns the process into a farce.

This denunciation was provoked by a paper the Geiers were in the process of having published and which detailed what they had been up to. It turns out that they believed that autism was caused by the mercury in vaccines, and that testosterone could somehow bind to mercury and make it harder to get rid of, creating so-called “testosterone sheets” inside the body. The Geiers were thus injecting autistic children with high doses of Lupron® (also known as leuprorelin and leuprolide), which delays puberty, and then performing chelation therapy on them, where a substance is used to bind to toxins and help the body eliminate them. None of this is supported by good scientific evidence; this is dangerous pseudoscience in the service of an anti-vaccine ideology.

Pseudoscience has a patina of legitimacy, and sure enough the Geiers were running actual medical tests on their patients. Per an investigation by the Chicago Tribune, it was revealed that the Geiers would order over 50 different tests, totalling up to $12,000. If one of the testosterone-related tests revealed a value outside of the reference range, Lupron injections would be considered at a daily dose “10 times the amount American doctors use to treat precocious puberty.” Keep in mind that the more medical tests you run, the higher the odds that one of them will turn up something outside the normal range by chance alone. Tests aren’t perfect and “normal” is not always easy to define.

Eventually, the Geiers’ aberrant behaviour led to penalties. Dr. Mark Geier’s medical licenses were suspended from every state in which he had one, and his son was charged in Maryland with practicing medicine without a license and fined $10,000.

While David Geier is clearly not qualified to be running a study for the U.S. government on the subject of vaccines, he is the ideal candidate for a regime that is institutionalizing pseudoscience within its borders.

**Doubt is our product**

The very media outlet that broke the story of David Geier’s latest commission referred to him as a “vaccine skeptic.” Legacy media outlets are failing to meet the moment here, either because of fear of lawsuits or as a misguided attempt to appear neutral. RFK Jr received a similar sanewashing in the media. If we can’t call anti-vaxxers “anti-vaxxers,” we will be unprepared for the outcome of their crusade.

The pieces of the puzzle are there for anyone to see. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—like the FDA and the CDC—are being gutted as you read these lines. The FDA’s former commissioner said of his agency that “it is finished.” Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, was apparently forced out a few days ago, writing that Kennedy wanted “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”

Meanwhile, a fake CDC website (RealCDC.org) with clear ties to Kennedy’s anti-vaccine organization mixed good science with vaccine misinformation before it was exposed and shut down. This is straight out of the Merchants of Doubt playbook: “doubt,” as one tobacco executive wrote decades ago, “is our product.” You don’t need to forcefully convince people that smoking is healthy; just make them doubt that we really know it’s harmful. The opposite can be done for vaccines.

Kennedy has announced a consolidation of divisions within his department and the creation of an Administration for a Healthy America, an Orwellian banner which echoes his “Make America Healthy Again” movement, itself a cargo cult fuelled by pseudoscience. Even more troubling is his desire to establish a vaccine injury agency within the CDC. Currently, people who think they have been injured by a mandated vaccine in the U.S. can receive compensation from the federal government. This was a way to ensure vaccines would continue to be available in the country after a wave of lawsuits in the 1980s. But will this system be maintained?

Kennedy’s institutionalization of anti-vaccine pseudoscience—meaning not just making the fringe mainstream but sanctioned by the government—could have a drastic impact on vaccine availability. Geier’s study, born out of the square one fallacy where something well established is argued to be unknown, will assuredly show a link between vaccines and autism through bad research practices. This government-commissioned study will then be used to encourage lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers—from which RFK Jr himself could financially benefit—and here is where we arrive at the final piece of the puzzle. Right now, vaccine makers benefit from the federal no-fault system compensating people believed to have been injured by a vaccine (whether they can successfully prove it or not). This protection could be eliminated.

We could subsequently see vaccine manufacturers decide to stop making vaccines for the American market because the risk of unwarranted lawsuits would be too high. The so-called free market would effectively eliminate vaccines in the United States. This is ultimately what Kennedy wants. He has, on multiple occasions, called childhood vaccines “a holocaust,” and he wants to save America from this perceived cataclysm. The outcome of this renunciation of reality will be death and disability, and with international travel, there will be spillover.

**What can we do in the face of this?**

As science communicator and immunologist Andrea Love wrote in her newsletter, Americans can call members of Congress, vote responsibly, and support unsanitized public health journalism.

All of us, Americans or not, will need to rely on uncorrupted sources of public health information moving forward. American government websites have been captured by science deniers. We need to turn to Canadian, British, European, and international websites instead. Even PubMed, the search engine of the biomedical literature, sits under the NIH and may not be spared from the U.S. ideological purge; I recommend the bookmarking of Europe PMC and OpenAlex as alternatives. In a move that echoes Isaac Asimov’s Foundation, U.S. government websites before Trump returned to office are being preserved and made accessible to the public, through portals such as the Health Data Preservation Project, the CDC Restored, the Data Rescue Project, and the CDC.gov Archive Index.

The future looks bleak but to quote a famous fictional scientist, “Life finds a way.” So will science.

**Take-home message:**

- David Geier, who has neither a medical degree nor a graduate degree, has been hired by the U.S. government to do a study on whether vaccines cause autism, even though mountains of evidence have shown no such connection
- Geier and his father, the late Dr. Mark Geier, have a history of unethical research practices, including violating their own research protocol when accessing CDC data, and David Geier was charged with practicing medicine without a license in 2011
- This commissioned study is one more step toward eliminating vaccines from the United States, as RFK Jr has often called childhood vaccines “a holocaust”

West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.

Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.

As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.

“Measles is so contagious I won’t be surprised if it enters other facilities,” Wells said.

There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",1jugj6x,https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-day-care-lubbock-3d90c3ea9050c12dbc74a8f8142a6355,98

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seemed to imply in recent days that the measles outbreak in western Texas was slowing down.

In a post on X on Sunday, Kennedy remarked on the second death linked to the outbreak, which occurred in an unvaccinated school-aged child.

About 10 minutes later, Kennedy edited the post to add that the curve has been flattening since early March, when he started sending in reinforcements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- supplying clinics with vaccines and other medications.

MORE: What to know about measles breakthrough cases and why vaccination is still important
However, data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showed that cases are increasing, with more counties in western Texas reporting infections.

Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock, Texas, said last week that public health officials were projecting ""a year-long timeline for control of the outbreak.""

""This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side of increasing number of cases, both due to spread and increased testing capacity,"" she said.

Public health specialists told ABC News they are skeptical that the curve is flattening and believe that cases linked to the outbreak are not only increasing, but likely much higher than the official case count.

""This outbreak is far from under control -- even if the curve begins to flatten, we still face major risks in under-vaccinated communities across the country,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer, as well as an ABC News contributor. ""With so many pockets of low vaccination, we're still on the brink of widespread, sustained transmission unless urgent action is taken.""

**Likely more cases in Texas**

As of Tuesday, there have been 505 confirmed measles cases in Texas, according to DSHS data.

Between March 28 and April 4, DSHS confirmed 81 cases -- one of the highest totals confirmed in a single week since the first cases were identified in late January. The Texas Department of State Health Services does not make hospitalization rates available to the public.

""We know that there have been more cases, at least sustained cases, over the past couple months. We know that the size of the outbreak has jumped pretty substantially over the past month,"" Dr. Craig Spencer, an associate professor of the practice of health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, told ABC News.

ABC News has requested a copy of the data that Kennedy is referring to when making claims about the curve flattening, but has not yet heard back from the HHS.

""We don't have a full picture of what's happening on the ground because of our inability to reach some communities. And so, I certainly would not feel confident saying that we have plateaued,"" he added.

Spencer said one reason he is not comfortable saying the outbreak has plateaued in Texas is that he believes the number of cases is likely an undercount.

Texas DSHS said any cases reported after March 16 are incomplete, and additional cases may be reported.

There have been two confirmed deaths linked to the Texas outbreak and a third death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult who tested positive after dying.

""We know that there's really, on average, about one death for every around 1,000 cases,"" Spencer said. ""We've already seen three deaths, which would make you suspect it's probably more like 3,000 cases.""

""It feels very, very likely that the count is higher than 500,"" he said, adding, ""It's not impossible for there to be three deaths among 500 cases, but statistically, one would expect more cases for that number of deaths.""

Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told ABC News there is risk in saying the cases have flattened when the data may suggest otherwise. Namely, she said is worried that people may be dissuaded from getting tested or treated.

""We know that many people are avoiding formal medical care and therefore testing. There is always a delay in reporting even when people are tested,"" Ranney said. ""I worry that people are afraid to get measles tested or to bring their kid in for care.""

""My other worry is we still want people to take prevention measures and, of course, we know the vaccine is not only the safest way, but also the most effective way to prevent infection with measles,"" she continued.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744032949.0,Third measles death. This is not normal. For three reasons. (via Your Local Epidemiologist),"Another child has died of measles. An 8-year-old girl. Unvaccinated. No underlying health conditions.

This is unbelievably tragic—and entirely preventable. It’s also not normal in three important ways.

**1. The number of deaths**

This is the third death in just three months—something we haven’t seen in the U.S. in decades.

Since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, we’ve seen outbreaks—most notably in California (starting in Disneyland) and in New York among the Hasidic Jewish community. But even in those large outbreaks, we did not see multiple deaths like this.

Before this year, there had only been three measles deaths since 2000:

2015: A 28-year-old immunocompromised woman in Washington was exposed in a clinic.

2003: A 75-year-old traveler from California with pneumonia. The other was a 13-year-old immunocompromised child (post–bone marrow transplant) living between Illinois and Mexico.

Today’s situation is different. It’s younger, healthier kids. And it’s happening more often.


This raises a critical question: Are we seeing the full picture? 

As of Saturday, there were 636 measles cases nationwide, 569 in the Panhandle outbreak alone, and 3 deaths. But that death toll doesn’t quite make sense.

Measles typically causes 1 to 3 deaths per 1,000 unvaccinated cases.

At that rate, 3 deaths would suggest somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 more cases—not just 569.

This outbreak may be significantly underreported and the largest in decades. Other signs point in the same direction, including very sick hospitalized patients (reflecting delays in seeking care), and epidemiologists are encountering resistance to case investigations.

Of course, there’s another possibility: this could simply be a statistical anomaly. Three deaths among a few hundred cases isn’t impossible—it’s just extremely rare. We’ve seen similar situations before. In 1991, for example, an outbreak in Philadelphia caused 1,400 cases and 9 pediatric deaths. In that case, religious leaders discouraged medical care, relying on prayer instead.

But whether this is an undercount or an outlier, one thing is clear: we are in new, unsettling territory.

**2. The boldness of a deceptive information campaign
Disinformation—false information intended to mislead— isn’t new, but it’s becoming more emboldened.**

Children’s Health Defense (CHD), the anti-vaccine organization founded by Secretary Kennedy, no longer operates on the sidelines. They built a fake CDC website pushing false claims about the MMR vaccine and autism. They’ve deployed “crisis teams.” They’ve shown up at the same places as the CDC response team.

Now, Robert Malone—a prominent anti-vaccine figure closely aligned with CHD—broke the news of the death Saturday. This was a day before Texas, CDC, or HHS made any public statement. Whether this came from an unauthorized leak or a deliberate tip is unknown, but they are clearly trying to control the narrative.

Malone blames the child’s death on medical errors, not measles. It’s a textbook disinformation move—an attempt to redirect blame and obscure the preventability of the disease.

His piece is riddled with red flag techniques:

Obfuscation (deliberate use of complex language): He tosses around complex medical jargon to create a sense of expertise and intimidate non-clinical readers. But to any medical professional, the logic falls apart. You don’t get sepsis from “chronic tonsillitis” and “chronic mononucleosis.” Budesonide wouldn’t treat sepsis or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He claims sedation caused “atelectasis,” which led to ARDS. In reality, measles causes pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Argument from authority (false authority): Malone cites an unnamed “Texas doctor” as his source, relying on the perceived credibility of a medical insider. But there’s no verification. It’s either a HIPAA violation, a game of telephone, or fabrication.

One-sided silence (exploiting HIPAA). He knows the hospital and treating physicians can’t respond because of HIPAA. He uses that silence as proof of guilt when, in fact, it’s a legal requirement meant to protect the patient and family.

Red herring (distraction from the real issue): Sure, some of the story may be partly true. Maybe there was a bacterial infection. Maybe she developed sepsis. Maybe measles made it worse. But even then, let’s be clear on the core issue—this child didn’t need to get measles in the first place.

Cherry-picking (misusing data to shift blame): This isn’t the first time anti-vaccine groups have tried to blame the doctors or hospitals. When the first death in this outbreak happened, they pushed the same narrative. The idea that 1 in 3 deaths are due to medical errors is based on a flawed, cherry-picked study.

This actively discourages people from seeking care, an incredibly dangerous message to send to vulnerable communities.

**3. An uncoordinated federal response**

Unlike the 2015 Disneyland outbreak in California or the 2019 outbreak in New York state—where federal, state, and local agencies worked together with clear communication and swift action—this time, it’s unclear what’s happening or who’s in charge.

Texas, to its credit, is stepping up—as it should. But this is now a multistate—and international—outbreak. It demands a federal response that’s unified, forward-looking, and transparent, and we’re not seeing that. CDC has a response team on the ground providing support, but it’s unclear how ASPR (helps coordinate disasters), FDA (given prescriptions are being used to treat off-label), the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response at the White House, or even the State Department (given the international aspects of this outbreak) are working together, if at all.

This also includes confusing talking points from Secretary Kennedy. Yesterday, Kennedy mentioned that the MMR vaccine was effective on X. But he left out that it was safe and hasn’t recommended universal vaccination. After a few hours, he followed that up by praising doctors in the community for treating measles with treatments that have no evidence behind them.

This is not how we stop an outbreak.

**Bottom line**
Children are dying from a disease we already eliminated. We know how to stop it—vaccinations. But this outbreak is not slowing down as it’s fueled by falsehoods and mistrust and compounded by a lack of strong leadership.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744077542.0,"Invasive strep infections have more than doubled in the U.S., CDC study finds","Severe, possibly life-threatening strep infections are rising in the United States.

The number of invasive group A strep infections more than doubled from 2013 to 2022, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Prior to that, rates of invasive strep had been stable for 17 years.

Invasive group A strep occurs when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the lungs or bloodstream. The same type of bacteria, group A streptococcus, is responsible for strep throat — a far milder infection. 

Invasive strep can trigger necrotizing fasciitis, a soft tissue infection also known as flesh-eating disease, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction akin to sepsis that can lead to organ failure.

“Within 24 to 48 hours, you could have very, very rapid deterioration,” said Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. Cases can transition from “seeming like a routine flu-like illness to rushing the patient to the ICU, fearing for their recovery,” he added.

The data came from 10 states, with roughly 35 million people total, that track the infections. 

In 2013, around 4 out of 100,000 people were diagnosed with invasive strep. By 2022, that rate had risen to around 8 out of 100,000. The number of cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022.

The study identified more than 21,000 total cases of the infection over the nine-year period, including almost 2,000 deaths. 

“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet said.

Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, said the threat of invasive strep to both the general population and high-risk groups has “substantially increased.”

The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections. It also offered a few possible explanations for the rise in cases.

First, rising rates of diabetes and obesity, among other underlying health conditions, over the study period made some people more vulnerable to invasive strep. Both diabetes and obesity can lead to skin infections or compromise the immune system.

Second, invasive strep is increasing among people who inject drugs, which can allow the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Infections have also increased in people experiencing homelessness — in 2022, the rate of infections among this population was 807 out of 100,000. Gregory said the rate was “among the highest ever documented worldwide.”

Finally, strains of group A strep appear to be expanding and becoming more diverse, which could create new opportunities for infection. Strains that have expanded in recent years seem more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, according to the study.

Those strains may also be driving resistance to antibiotics used to treat certain cases of invasive group A strep, macrolides and clindamycin. While penicillin is the go-to antibiotic to treat strep infections, it can be used in combination with clindamycin to treat toxic shock syndrome, and doctors sometimes prescribe a macrolide if a patient has a penicillin allergy.

Overall, the study found that the rate of infections was highest in adults ages 65 and older, and rose in all adults from 2013 to 2022. But it did not detect an increased rate in children.

“That was, to me, the most shocking part of the study,” said Dr. Allison Eckard, division chief for pediatric infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Because clinically, we really are seeing what feels like an increase.”

In late 2022, there were widespread reports from children’s hospitals of a spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep. The CDC issued an alert at the time, noting a possible link to respiratory viruses such as flu, Covid and RSV, which can make people susceptible to strep infections.

Eckard said pediatric cases have also started to look different in recent years.

“We are just seeing more severe cases, more unusual cases, more necrotizing fasciitis, and cases that do raise concern that there is something going on more nationally,” she said.

Eckard added that more research should explore whether certain strep strains are becoming more virulent, or if severe strains are becoming more prevalent. 

Doctors said the rise in group A strep infections also points to the need for a vaccine, especially given the rise in antibiotic resistance. However, Nizet questioned whether that would be feasible now, with top vaccine scientists leaving the Food and Drug Administration.

“The lack of vaccine is devastating,” Nizet said. “Of course, we’re concerned about the turn of attitudes at the FDA and the CDC that seem to be putting some sticks in the spokes of the wheel of vaccine development.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1744041042.0,CDC’s top laboratory on sexually transmitted diseases is shut by Trump administration,"At a time when the world is down to a single drug that can reliably cure gonorrhea, the U.S. government has shuttered the country’s premier sexually transmitted diseases laboratory, leaving experts aghast and fearful about what lies ahead.

The STD lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a leading player in global efforts to monitor for drug resistance in the bacteria that cause these diseases — was among the targets of major staff slashing at the CDC this past week. All 28 full-time employees of the lab were fired. [...] 

“The loss of this lab is a huge deal to the American people,” said David C. Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, which represents state, city, and U.S. territorial STD prevention programs across the country. “Without that lab, we would have not been able to appropriately diagnose and monitor drug-resistant gonorrhea.” [...] 

Though STDs don’t garner as many headlines as Ebola, influenza, or Covid-19, they are among the most common diseases in the world — not just infectious diseases, but diseases period, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases, population, and public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine. 

Klausner was shocked by the CDC lab’s closure. “To me, this is like a blind man with a chainsaw has just gone through the system and arbitrarily cut things without any rationale,” he said in an interview. 
In terms of the decision’s implications for efforts to monitor for drug-resistant STDs, Klausner put it bluntly: “We are blind. As of [Tuesday], we are blind.”
Ina Park, a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine, and a co-author of the CDC’s 2024 laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of syphilis, was also appalled.

“It’s just horrific and it’s so foolish and shortsighted,” Park said. “This administration has sometimes brought people back when they’ve realized that a service is vital and this is one of the times where I’m hoping that they will step up and do this.”
Klausner knows Kennedy personally, and reached out to tell him cutting the CDC’s STD lab was a mistake. As of Saturday, Klausner said he had not heard back from Kennedy on this issue.

The STD lab served multiple functions — updating treatment guidelines, monitoring resistance patterns, and working to develop better tests for syphilis, a resurgent infection for which existing tests are outdated.

Oakland County reported its first case of mumps since 2022 on Friday.

It comes as the county also reported Michigan's first case of measles this year.

Health leaders say the recent mumps and measles cases underscore the importance of vaccination, as both viruses are preventable with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

An adult in Oakland County has the mumps, county health officials said Friday. It's the first case of the virus since 2022 in Oakland County and the ninth case in Michigan this year.

“This case of mumps, coming just weeks after Oakland County’s first measles case of the year, underscores the essential role of vaccination in protecting our communities,” said Kate Guzmán, Oakland County health officer, in a statement. “The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine remains our best defense against measles, mumps and rubella, offering highly effective protection against these serious diseases and helping to prevent outbreaks.”",1js33k6,https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2025/04/04/oakland-county-michigan-mumps-vaccination-mmr/82866221007/,128

The nation is battling its worst spike in cases since 2019, fueled by outbreaks in communities where vaccine uptake is lower and by increased global spread of the virus. The CDC said 2 more jurisdictions reported cases this week, raising the total to 22—21 states and New York City. One more outbreak was reported, making six so far, and 93% of cases confirmed so far are part of outbreaks.

Of the total patients, 97% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination statuses, and 74 (12%) have been hospitalized. The nation is on track to pass the 1,274 cases reported in 2019, a year when a surge of measles activity threatened the nation's measles elimination status, which it earned in 2000.

**Texas total climbs to 481 cases**

The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 59 more cases, pushing the state's total since January to 481 in 19 counties. Fourteen more people were hospitalized for their infections, bringing that total to 56.

Of the state's total, 471 patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. 

Though most cases are reported in Gaines County on the border with New Mexico, a few linked to the outbreak have been reported in counties in central Texas, including Brown and Erath counties. 

In a new development, the Harris County Public Health (HCPH), home to Houston in the southeastern part of the state, said it is investigating a confirmed measles case in a child who lives in the northwestern part of the county and has no travel history.

The HCPH said the case was confirmed by a commercial lab and awaits secondary confirmation by the TDSHS. So far, it's not clear if the case is linked to the outbreak in west Texas. The case marks Harris County's first since 2019.

Meanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDH) reported six more cases, raising the state's total to 54. The New Mexico outbreak is limited to two counties—Lea and Eddy— that border the Texas outbreak hot spot. Among the 54 patients, 48 were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.

Oklahoma, another state with cases linked to the Texas outbreak, reported no new cases today, keeping its total at 10, which includes 8 confirmed and 2 probable.

**Cases rise in Tennessee**

Outbreaks are occurring in other states, though it’s not clear if all are linked to the Texas event.

The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) said this week that three more cases have been confirmed in middle Tennessee, bringing the state's total to four.

One of the newly confirmed cases is linked to the first Tennessee case, which was confirmed on March 21, and the exposure source is unknown. The TDH added that no other details are available about the other cases.",1jrmeol,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-measles-total-tops-600-cases-almost-500-texas?fbclid=IwY2xjawJdJdhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHrq5Gn8nxC-J8qmyQbrG_S7v3ddxHRI0ecph1tAwXmopPxl4FdYR1b6z_SYl_aem_L3aeLreKyUe1mOfPUi3F6g,750
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743767194.0,"Whooping cough cases climb nationally, two infants die in Louisiana","In his 20 years working in pediatric infectious disease, Dr. John Schieffelin has never seen another illness like pertussis. Also known as whooping cough, it's a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it's continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.

""For infants, it's really rather terrifying,"" he said. ""They're just coughing so much, they can't eat, they can't drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. ... They just never stop coughing.""

In Louisiana, 2 infants have died of pertussis in the past 6 months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018. Louisiana has had 110 cases of pertussis reported so far in 2025, the health department said -- already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.

Cases are on the rise nationally too. There were more than 35 000 cases of whooping cough in 2024 in the USA, the highest number in more than a decade, and 10 people died -- 6 of them less than one year old. Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6600 cases already in 2025, almost 4 times the number at this point in 2024.

""When you start to see these outbreaks ... it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,"" said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.

Concerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination. The USA had more than 200 000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By 1948, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the COVID-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.

Children are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months, and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the CDC. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.

Infants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn. This prevents 78% of pertussis cases in young infants and is 91% effective against hospitalization, the CDC says. Another strategy that can protect infants is ""cocooning,"" in which members of the child's household all get vaccinated to ensure protection, Schieffelin said. Boosters are recommended because protection from the vaccine can fade over time, which may be one reason for the ongoing outbreaks. Declining vaccination rates are another reason. The percentage of American kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past 5 years, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.

Organizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.

""Especially in a state like Louisiana, we've got a lot of poverty. We've got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,"" said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.

Pertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.

""The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine-preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships, and media campaigns,"" Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. ""While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.""

The memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as COVID and flu vaccines, usually given at the state's mass vaccination clinics, and routine childhood vaccines, which it called ""an important part of providing immunity to our children."" But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.

""When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,"" said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department. Last week, Abraham shared vaccination guidelines on Facebook while acknowledging the pertussis deaths and increasing cases in the state. ""I've been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it's going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,"" Avegno said. ""It's maybe too little, too late.""

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1743717003.0,How Kennedy is already weakening America's childhood vaccine system,"
The Department of Health and Human Services cut $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children, forcing public health departments to lay off staff and cancel clinics.

April 4, 2025, 8:11 AM GMT+13
Last week, Jackie Griffith showed up at her office at the Collin County Health Care Clinic in north Texas ready to start her day — answering emails from local doctors before heading to a nearby high school to go over the latest vaccine record requirements. 

Instead, the 60-year-old registered nurse was called into her director’s office and told to pack up her belongings. The federal government had yanked funding, she learned, and her position — supporting vaccination efforts for uninsured children through a network of more than 60 providers — was gone. 

Across the country in New Hampshire, Kayla Hogan, 27, was hearing the same. She worked for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, onboarding clinics and hospitals into a data system that would help them administer free childhood vaccines. Now that project was in jeopardy, threatening the process of getting children vaccinated.  

The cuts that ensnared Griffith, Hogan and many others whose work touches vaccines in dozens of states were part of $11.4 billion in funds that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services pulled back from state and community health departments last week, included in the larger slashing of federal government under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. More than $2 billion was taken from “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” grants, which support the delivery of vaccines to children whose families may not be able to afford them,  according to a list HHS published.  

Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist with a well-documented history of promoting misinformation, promised ahead of his confirmation as HHS secretary that he would not take away vaccines. Since taking office, however, he has repeatedly downplayed the severity of measles currently sweeping the country — outbreaks that have hospitalized scores of children and left at least two dead. He has publicly pushed unproven treatments, including vitamin A regimens that have reportedly sickened children, and offered limp public support for vaccines themselves — despite vaccines offering the safest, most effective way to prevent many infectious diseases. Under his leadership, HHS has overseen mass firings across federal health agencies, including staff responsible for outbreak response and vaccine access; canceled or postponed meetings of independent vaccine advisory committees; and ended vaccine education campaigns.  

The funding cuts under his watch go further, turning his rhetoric into reality and weakening the systems that deliver lifesaving preventative care. Through sweeping reductions to state and local health agencies, the new administration is quietly dismantling the fragile, interconnected infrastructure that moves childhood vaccines from the federal government to providers and, ultimately, to children.  

The cuts have hit health departments and medical providers, the data systems that track immunizations and the nonprofit coalitions that make the whole system run. They come at a moment when public health officials and advocates say that despite federal assurances, childhood vaccines are under attack. 

“It will impact every aspect of immunization: community outreach, education, health fairs, mobile clinics and public health nurses,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. “It’s catastrophic.” 

Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., sued HHS and Kennedy this week over the funding takebacks. 

HHS did not respond to a request for comment.  

Ostensibly, the federal cuts were aimed at Covid-era projects that were no longer necessary. 

“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the department’s director of communications, Andrew Nixon, said last week. 

While an early wave of Covid funding focused on testing, vaccines and addressing health disparities, as the pandemic waned, state health departments were allowed to shift that money to other underfunded programs — including grants that support childhood vaccinations. 

Those grants supplement Vaccines for Children, a federal entitlement program established by Congress in 1994 in response to a deadly measles epidemic, which remains intact. But its successful operation relies on the “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” funding, which received a temporary boost from reallocated Covid dollars — until that money was pulled back last week.  

Now, the cuts have forced public health departments across the country to lay off staff, cancel vaccine clinics, shut down education and outreach programs, and halt critical physical and virtual infrastructure upgrades, according to news reports, declarations filed in the federal lawsuit against HHS and results from a survey conducted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials and shared with NBC News. 

In Dallas County, Texas, the health director said the cuts compelled the cancellation of 50 community vaccination events — including many in schools with low measles vaccination rates amid a rising outbreak.  

In Minnesota, the Health Department announced it would lay off 170 employees after losing more than $220 million in federal funds. Among the casualties is the state’s immunization registry, which will no longer be upgraded — leaving Minnesota with one of the most outdated tracking systems in the country. 

In California, the Health Department said in a federal filing that it would be unable to provide childhood vaccines, including for measles, to millions of children, roughly half of the state’s youth. 

And in Washington state, the Health Department announced that in response to $20 million in grant cuts targeting immunization programs, it would furlough or lay off 46 workers and suspend its mobile clinic operation, known as the Care-a-Van. The 104 canceled clinics were expected to administer 2,000 vaccines to vulnerable kids, including those in rural areas and homeless populations. 

“We’re just going to have to think strategically about how we reach those really difficult-to-reach populations,” Lacy Fehrenbach, Washington’s chief of prevention, said at a media briefing. 

The National Association of County and City Health Officials survey captured further impacts: A department in Ohio said it plans to halt training on vaccine hesitancy. One in Indiana will lose two nurses who travel to schools to vaccinate children, so parents don’t have to miss work. A Texas agency will not be able to replace old equipment as planned. 

The cuts also threaten a less visible but critical part of the vaccine infrastructure: the data systems that public health departments use to record and share immunizations. Vaccines for Children relies on these systems to order doses, approve and track distribution, and monitor safety. 

Health departments in Pennsylvania and elsewhere said in declarations filed in the federal case that the cuts would prevent them from operating or upgrading these systems, forcing states to rely on outdated, cumbersome platforms. Poor data systems can leave parents and providers without access to vaccination records and increase the risk of missed or duplicate doses. 

Rebecca Coyle, executive director of the American Immunization Registry Association, noted that these systems were born out of a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of 89 children in the early 1990s, including an 11-year-old girl who died after being denied a vaccine — despite her father’s efforts to get her immunized — because the clinic couldn’t locate the right records. 

While much attention is given to parents who hesitate or outright refuse to vaccinate, it is the children without access to vaccines who offer the clearest path to closing immunity gaps, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. 

“The way we get from 60% of our population vaccinated to over 95% is by focusing on people who, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty getting vaccinated,” he said. “That includes the homeless, low-income individuals, and people without a primary care provider.” 

These funding cuts, Benjamin said, degraded the ability to reach those populations “literally overnight.” 

Immunization coalitions — nonprofits that connect public health departments with communities to improve vaccination rates — play a key role, too. Now their work mostly supported by state and federal dollars is at risk. 

The cuts caused “immense damage” to Indiana’s Immunization Coalition, according to its executive director, Lisa Robertson, who said in a statement that its budget — funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via the state Health Department — was slashed entirely for this year and reduced by 75% for the next fiscal year. 

“The clawback of funds will have real-life consequences,” Robertson said. ",1jqvc5h,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188,512
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743717772.0,"Ontario reports 89 new measles cases, bringing provincial count to 661","TORONTO — Ontario is reporting 89 new measles cases over the last week, bringing the province’s case count to 661 since an outbreak began in the fall.

That’s compared to just over 100 new cases last week and 120 the week before.

Dr. Sarah Wilson, a public health physician at Public Health Ontario, said numbers “look to be stabilizing somewhat in the range of around 100 cases a week.”

“But, I also want to be really clear – that’s still 100 cases a week too many of measles,” Wilson said Thursday.

Wilson said there were 52 hospitalizations – 10 more than last week – including three in intensive care.

“There is this, I think myth, among some individuals that measles is a harmless, trivial, mild infection,” she said.


She also said measles cases still predominantly involve unvaccinated children in Ontario’s Southwestern Public Health unit, which accounts for almost 45 per cent of the province’s cases.

The number of cases in Quebec remained at 40 for a third week, while Alberta’s count reached 24, according to data released Wednesday. Saskatchewan health officials issued a public notice Monday of an increased measles exposure risk, with three cases in the province.

Ontario’s chief medical officer of health said last week that the province’s measles outbreak is likely to continue into the summer, but the stable rate of new cases is a sign of hope.

Dr. Kieran Moore also said the “vast majority” of Ontario’s measles cases are in Mennonite, Amish and other Anabaptist communities.

Public health units keen to share information have enlisted help from a Low German radio station based in Aylmer, Ont., known as De Brigj 105.9 FM. De Brigj translates to “the bridge” in English, says Anna Bergen, executive director at Mennonite Community Services, which owns the station.

“Which is what we try to do – we try to bridge the two languages,” says Bergen.

The station began broadcasting in 2003 to serve newcomers, she says, specifically Low German speaking populations. Many are from Mexico and in southern Ontario’s Elgin County for agricultural jobs.

She said Southwestern Public Health buys ad time on the station to distribute public health messages, which staff at the station translate into Low German, taking into account cultural subtleties.

Earlier in the week, the local health unit’s Dr. Ninh Tran cautioned against associating the spread of the illness with a single demographic.

“Measles is here. It is an equal opportunity illness. It does not care about your gender, your address, your religion or your race,” Tran told reporters Wednesday.

“It is known as one of the most contagious illnesses globally, and currently, the most effective way to safely prevent measles is through vaccination.” [...] ",1jqvngs,https://www.cp24.com/local/toronto/2025/04/03/ontario-reports-89-new-measles-cases-bringing-provincial-count-to-661/,50
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743682969.0,"Decimation of HHS comms, FOIA offices will leave Americans in the dark about urgent health matters","The DOGE cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday will make America less safe. Unless something is done soon to change course, they will also make it easier to hide corrupt behavior by the agency’s leadership.  

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took office promising “radical transparency.” His plan to reshape the agency is indeed radical, but so far, there’s very little transparency.

Because in addition to cutting HIV prevention and combating smoking, Kennedy’s HHS gutted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and communications teams across the agency. The dismissal of these employees will make it harder for HHS agencies to communicate with the public, and that endangers Americans’ access to vital health information.

Communications from HHS had slowed to a trickle even before the latest rounds of firings — a source of tension between the White House and the department, according to Axios. **Since Jan. 20, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not held a press briefing on any number of infectious disease outbreaks — measles, Ebola, or avian flu. (I was the director of CDC’s Office of Communications until March 21, when I resigned in protest.)**

Tuesday’s firings will allow political appointees, who in many cases have little public health expertise, to exert an even tighter grip on communications across the agency. That could make it more difficult for federal scientists to get out health information that political leaders don’t like and further politicize public health communications.

Tuesday’s firings will allow political appointees, who in many cases have little public health expertise, to exert an even tighter grip on communications across the agency. That could make it more difficult for federal scientists to get out health information that political leaders don’t like and further politicize public health communications.

But even if you ignore the concern that cuts to communications personnel make political interference more likely, they also carry practical implications for the department’s basic capacity to communicate with the public. At the CDC, for example, its studio team was fired, in addition to digital and social media communicators.  If human-to-human transmission of the avian flu happened tomorrow, and the agency wanted to hold a press briefing in its studio, they don’t have a full-time employee who can operate the sound.  Meanwhile, the media relations team that usually answers the phones and the main media email inbox was decimated, too.

Despite all the lessons learned during the pandemic about how important timely, accurate communications are to protecting the public’s health, because of yesterday’s firings, we must now collectively cross our fingers and hope that we avoid a significant, new disease outbreak. We aren’t prepared to deal with it.

The firings of communicators across HHS will hurt its ability to get vital information to the public, but the reported dismissal of FOIA staff further endangers government accountability and the fundamental goal of fostering an informed citizenry.

FOIA, which allows reporters and everyday citizens to request information, records and data from the federal government, is an imperfect tool — sometimes annoyingly slow for filers and a mountain of thankless work for those responsible for fulfilling the requests. But it does help hold leaders accountable for their decisions, and it subjects the work of government officials to needed scrutiny, which helps to curb corruption.

All of this is happening when there are already concerns that HHS may be exploring ways to find evidence to support a discredited theory advanced by the secretary: that vaccines are linked to autism. Given Kennedy’s advocacy against vaccines, vaccine-related work should be done in the light of day, not in secret.

Add to that concern the very real possibility that the firings of full-time employees may lead to more hiring of outside vendors — traditionally an area for malfeasance. Eliminating FOIA personnel imperils FOIA as an accountability tool, encouraging mischief or worse.

Now, to give Kennedy and his team the benefit of the doubt here, maybe they have a plan to restore FOIA or introduce a new level of automation that will make it faster and more efficient. If so, they need to explain it in detail immediately and let experts determine whether it adds up.  

Failing that, yesterday’s deep cuts to HHS agencies, including to communications and FOIA employees, portend trouble for the country. Things are likely to break, and in public health, that can have life and death consequences.

Kevin Griffis led CDC communications from June 2022 to March 2025.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743684291.0,Vietnam: Guinea worm resurfaces after WHO certification,"Although the World Health Organization (WHO) once certified Vietnam as free from Dracunculus medinensis, commonly known as the guinea worm, recent years have seen the parasite reappear in isolated cases - raising concerns about dangerous complications and potential public health risks.

Speaking at the 51st National Conference on Parasitology on April 1, Associate Professor Dr. Do Trung Dung from the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology (Hanoi) revealed significant changes in Vietnam’s parasitic infection landscape.

Dr. Dung noted that WHO officially recognized Vietnam as free of the guinea worm in 1998. However, beginning in 2020, isolated infections have emerged. Over the past five years, 24 cases have been documented, all in adult males across five provinces: Yen Bai (11 cases), Phu Tho (8), Lao Cai (2), Hoa Binh (1), and Thanh Hoa (2).

Patients typically reported eating undercooked animal meat - such as fish, frogs, and snakes - or drinking untreated water. Once inside the body, guinea worm larvae incubate for 10 to 12 months before the mature worm begins its painful journey outward through the skin.

In light of these cases, WHO has issued new recommendations for Vietnam, calling for improved surveillance, public health education, and epidemiological research into the parasite.

Currently, there are no diagnostic tests, medications, or vaccines available to detect, treat, or prevent guinea worm disease. Treatment is limited to waiting for the worm to naturally emerge from the skin - a process that may take several days to a month. The worms can reach lengths of 70 centimeters to 1.2 meters.

According to Dr. Dung, forcibly extracting the worm or attempting surgical removal can be extremely dangerous. “Each guinea worm may carry 3 to 4 million larvae. If the worm is broken during extraction, it can release toxins and larvae into the body, leading to inflammation, secondary infections, or even sepsis,” he explained. Other severe complications include joint immobility and abscesses caused by dead worms.

To prevent guinea worm disease and other parasitic infections, Dr. Dung urged the public to practice safe food and hygiene habits.

These include eating well-cooked food, drinking boiled water, maintaining clean water sources, managing waste effectively, and ensuring hygiene in kitchens and food preparation areas.

He also advised against using untreated human waste as fertilizer and warned against free-range livestock practices, encouraging measures to eliminate flies, cockroaches, and other disease vectors.",1jqhgpn,https://vietnamnet.vn/en/guinea-worm-resurfaces-in-vietnam-after-who-certification-affects-only-men-2386841.html,80
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743714885.0,Mpox activity in Africa on pace to pass 2024 total,"Mpox activity continues to fluctuate among different countries in Africa, but as a whole the situation continues to escalate, with the region in the first 3 months of the new year nearly reaching 50% of the cases reported for all of 2024, the head of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said today at the agency’s weekly briefing.

Uganda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounted for 95% of the confirmed cases last week, but Africa CDC Director Jean Kaseya, MD, MPH, said the full picture in the DRC is hazy, because test coverage is low, at 18.4%, due to ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the country and problems collecting samples and transporting them to labs owing to foreign aid cuts.

The DRC is also grappling with a major measles outbreak. Kyeng Mercy, PhD, epidemic intelligence unit lead at Africa CDC, said about 12,000 measles cases have been reported this year, along with 180 deaths, in 26 provinces, though most are from North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, which are difficult to access because of armed conflict.

**First case in Ghana after 11-week break**

Kaseya said that, in other outbreak developments, Ghana reported its first mpox case after going 11 weeks with no new cases. 

The patient is a 29-year-old man with no travel history or recent contact with wildlife. He works as a skin aesthetician and was involved in treating a patient with ""large pimples."" Lab results determined that the worker's infection involved the clade 2 virus.

Kaseya added that the new case in Ghana is a reminder of the importance of beefing up surveillance, even in countries that aren't current mpox hot spots.

Officials said they are seeing a mixed picture in different countries, with cases rising in Tanzania, one of the newer hot spots. However, cases in Uganda trended downward last week, as the country prepares to launch the second phase of its mpox vaccine campaign.

**Weighing options for tackling financial challenges**

In other developments, Kaseya said Africa CDC today released a concept paper on health financing in ""a new era,"" which comes amid a historic 70% drop in official development assistance from 2021 to 2025 alongside deep-rooted vulnerabilities, which include unprecedented outbreaks and rising debt.

The paper focuses on three pillars, which include boosts in domestic health financing and innovative financing tools, such as a levy on airline tickets. The third is blended financing measures, such as manufacturing medical countermeasures in Africa, and improving the data connectivity and supply chain infrastructure.",1jquh4u,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/mpox-activity-africa-pace-pass-2024-total,15
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743599710.0,NYT: I Study Measles. I’m Terrified We’re Headed for an Epidemic,"We used to think of measles outbreaks in the United States as isolated events: short-lived and confined to close-knit communities with low vaccination rates. A flare here, a bubble there. But as those bubbles grow and converge, the United States could be at risk for tens of thousands of cases.

Measles was declared eliminated in this country in 2000. That didn’t mean the virus disappeared. It meant we stopped it from spreading freely. It was a hard-won public health triumph made possible by decades of vaccination. But that protection is now unraveling.

Vaccine skepticism has become increasingly mainstream, amplified by pandemic-era backlash, a torrent of online misinformation and support from the new health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been at the center of vaccine misinformation for over a decade. A growing outbreak in Texas, and cases in over a dozen states, shows how fragile our defenses have become.

Measles is among the most contagious viruses known. A single case can cause dozens more in places where people are unvaccinated. Infants too young for vaccination, immune-compromised people and the elderly are all at risk. Measles isn’t just a fever and rash. It can cause pneumonia, brain inflammation, permanent disability and death. The virus can go dormant in the body only to re-emerge a decade or so after infection and cause rapid and fatal brain tissue deterioration.

It also has a more insidious legacy, one I helped discover. In 2015, I led a team that found that measles can erase the immune system’s protective memory of prior infections. This “immune amnesia,” as it’s called, leaves people vulnerable to viruses and bacteria they were once protected against. In a follow-up study in 2019, we found measles can wipe out up to 70 percent of an individual’s protective immune memory.

This means that people who get measles now may be at increased risk of infection by essentially all other pathogens that they would otherwise be well protected against. After measles, these individuals have to embark on a yearslong and risk-filled recovery of re-infections and exposures to build back up the protective shields they previously had.

The current measles outbreak, with more than 480 cases, largely in unvaccinated children, is gearing up to be the worst in years. And it’s likely just the beginning. Recent studies estimate that more than nine million American children are susceptible to measles. The number of people susceptible balloons further still when you add the 3.6 million infants who are too young to be vaccinated and the millions of immunocompromised Americans who can’t safely receive the vaccine.

Fears of tens of thousands of measles cases in the United States is not an overreaction. It’s a scenario that recently played out elsewhere. Europe, where measles had also been largely eliminated, saw more than 80,000 cases in 2018, driving tens of thousands of hospitalizations and over 70 otherwise preventable deaths. Several countries lost their elimination status.

The United States came dangerously close to this scenario in 2019, when more than 1,200 cases were reported, largely in communities with low vaccination rates. Even President Trump urged Americans to get immunized, saying: “They have to get the shot. The vaccinations are so important.”

Then the pandemic hit and helped drive a social and political climate that is more hostile to vaccines than any in recent history. Vaccination rates among American kindergartners have fallen two percentage points since 2019. Some states, including Texas, the center of the current outbreak, have seen even sharper drops among individual school districts. School-level data show clusters with fewer than 70 percent of children vaccinated, well below the level needed to prevent outbreaks.

If you’re vaccinated or have previously been infected, you’re well protected. That’s especially true if you received the standard two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as a child, as most Americans born after 1989 have. (For those who received only a single dose, including those born before 1989, a second dose may have already been received through national catch-up campaigns). For most people, getting a booster on top of the two isn’t necessary. But if you’re unsure about your vaccination status, it’s reasonable to check your records and talk to your doctor. For those wondering whether a booster might help, a clinician can order a simple antibody test to assess immunity.

Parents should make sure their children are up to date on their vaccines, particularly before they enter school or travel internationally. For infants under 1 who aren’t yet eligible for M.M.R. vaccination and who live in areas where measles is spreading (which is a rapidly expanding list), it’s worth asking your pediatrician about getting the first dose early, as young as 6 months. Measles is airborne and can linger in the air for hours. If an unvaccinated infant enters, say, a grocery store where someone with measles was even hours before, he is at risk for infection.

Instead of focusing on getting people measles vaccines, Mr. Kennedy is putting resources into a study into vaccine-autism links. Although the theory that vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked, new research would be welcome if it provided clarity for those still with questions. Unfortunately, the study is being led by a known vaccine skeptic with essentially no research or medical credentials who was reprimanded for practicing medicine without a license. His history raises serious ethical concerns and dooms the credibility of the study before it even begins.

Public health depends on public trust. When that trust is broken, when people start to see vaccines as personal choices without regard to public health — or, worse, as threats — diseases like measles come roaring back. This outbreak may still seem small. But that’s exactly how it starts. Each case is a spark. And the fuel is all around us.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743620309.0,"COVID-19 re-infection doubles risk of long COVID in kids, young adults, data reveal","Compared with after a first COVID-19 illness, being re-infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, doubles the risk of later developing long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in children, teens, and young adults, according to a new preprint study posted on medRxiv.

The retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium collected from 40 US children's hospitals from January 2022 through October 2023, when the Omicron variant was predominant. The study involved 465,717 patients 20 years old and younger with confirmed COVID-19 during the study period; the median age was 8 years. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.

The population had a very low rate of long COVID, defined by the study authors as a diagnosis based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD10-CM) U09.9 diagnosis code of PASC. Only 208 patients were diagnosed as having the condition after their first SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 134 long-COVID patients identified after their second infection. The rate per million patients per 6 months was 903 after the first infection and 1,884 after the second infection.

**Higher rate of long COVID plus many specific conditions**

Compared with the first COVID-19 infection, a second infection was associated with twice the increased risk of a long-COVID diagnosis (relative risk [RR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68 to 2.59). The second infection was also tied to a 50% or greater increase in several specific long-COVID conditions, including myocarditis (RR, 3.60), changes in taste and smell (2.83), heart disease (1.96), acute kidney injury (1.90), generalized pain (1.70), arrhythmias (1.59), abnormal liver enzymes (1.56), and fatigue or malaise (1.50).

These findings emphasize the ongoing risk of PASC with reinfection, regardless of severity, and suggest that the risk of PASC may be cumulative with each successive infection,"" the study authors write.

""Given that vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of PASC, these findings underscore the importance of reinforcing public health efforts to promote vaccination among adolescents and younger children.",1jpwp0k,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-19-re-infection-doubles-risk-long-covid-kids-young-adults-data-reveal?fbclid=IwY2xjawJaZ9hleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHXjdkam9E15wTAYRwVvDneY0ciIkiLyaa2BF5uhO7IehkIjcYqyC-xpgpw_aem_QMQW1PskUhB2deRsY1v9Cw,97
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743535143.0,Measles outbreak spreads into counties near Central Texas,"HOUSTON — A measles outbreak has grown by nearly 100 cases in the last week, according to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. There are now 422 confirmed cases across 19 counties, up from 327 on Tuesday, March 25. 

The outbreak has expanded beyond West Texas and the Panhandle with confirmed cases in Erath County, southwest of Fort Worth, and Brown County, between Abilene and Killeen. Lamar County in far northeast Texas has 10 cases.

Officials say 42 people have been hospitalized. 

One unvaccinated school-aged child has died from measles. She lived in the outbreak area and had no known underlying health conditions. Her family is part of the Mennonite community in West Texas identified by the state as the center of a measles outbreak that began in January. The girl's parents recently defended their stance on the vaccine. 

“God does no wrong,"" the father told an anti-vaccine organization. ""It was her time on earth. She’s better off now where she is.""

All but two of the Texas patients were unvaccinated.

While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also been an outspoken critic of vaccines, he said the MMR vaccine is crucial to protect children from the potentially deadly disease.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, and DSHS warns that additional cases are likely in both the affected counties and surrounding communities. The department is working closely with local health officials to track and contain the spread.

According to the latest data, the vast majority of the outbreak remains concentrated in rural counties in the South Plains and Panhandle:

Gaines County: 280 cases
Terry County: 41 cases
Dawson County: 14 cases
Yoakum County: 16 cases
Lubbock County: 27 cases
*Cases in Harris, Fort Bend, Rockwall and Travis counties aren't related to the outbreak and were linked to international travel.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743444936.0,Russia Denies Reports of Mystery Virus Causing Victims to Cough Up Blood,"Russian authorities have dismissed growing speculation over reports of an unidentified virus that causes patients to cough up blood and suffer from prolonged high fever, saying no new pathogens have been detected.

The rumors, which originated on the Telegram channel SHOT and were amplified by local media, centered on patients exhibiting severe respiratory symptoms but testing negative for influenza and COVID-19.

Officials now attribute the cases to common respiratory infections, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Rospotrebnadzor, a Russian agency responsible for overseeing consumer rights protection and public health, said in a statement that there is ""no evidence of a new or unidentified virus circulating on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

Newsweek has contacted Rospotrebnadzor and the Press Service and Information Department of the Government of the Russian Federation, via email, for comment.

Why It Matters

The speed with which viral rumors can trigger public concern is a growing challenge for health officials in Russia and globally.

Claims of a mysterious respiratory illness come amid lingering sensitivities from the COVID-19 pandemic, where early miscommunication and underreporting contributed to delayed containment.

Authorities in Moscow moved quickly to investigate and quash the reports.

But there has long been widespread distrust in Russian authorities when it comes to transparency.

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple doctors said they did not trust the COVID-19 vaccine touted by President Vladimir Putin.

After Russia's health ministry announced that the production of the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute outside of Moscow had begun in 2020, 52 percent of 3,000 medics surveyed said they would not take it.

What To Know
Reports about an ""unknown virus"" first surfaced on March 29 on SHOT, a Russian breaking news Telegram channel with purported links to various federal agencies

It said that patients in multiple Russian cities were reporting high fevers, body aches and severe coughing that persisted for weeks, which sometimes included blood.

But tests for influenza A, B, and SARS-CoV-2, which could be responsible for these symptoms, reportedly came back negative.

One woman identified only as Alexandra told SHOT that by the fifth day of illness, she began coughing up blood. ""Even after a week of taking antibiotics, the coughing fits didn't stop,"" she said.

Alexandra said her physicians eventually diagnosed her with Mycoplasma pneumonia, a bacterial infection that mimics many symptoms of viral flu and pneumonia.

The symptoms described—initial fatigue and aches, followed by high fever and a debilitating cough—were similar in several other cases mentioned by SHOT.

Doctors reportedly listed the cause on medical forms as ""acute upper respiratory tract infection of unspecified origin,"" and recommended ambulance calls if symptoms worsened.

The reports were picked up by mainstream Russian media, including Lenta.ru and Newizv.ru, which repeated the claims while also noting the absence of formal confirmation from state health agencies.

Newizv quoted people who had posted about their symptoms in the comments section of the Telegram channel Moscow Live's report about illness in the city.

One person said: ""It's a nightmare, my ribs are already hurting from the cough, it's impossible to eat, sometimes even the medications make me feel sick.""

Another said: ""The cough hasn't gone away for over a month, the fever lasted for almost three weeks. I got over Covid much easier.""

But Rospotrebnadzor said on Monday that the situation was ""stable and completely controlled.""

What People Are Saying
Rospotrebnadzor said: ""Currently, the epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation for a group of respiratory infections, including SARS, influenza, COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia, is stable and fully controlled. There is a decrease in the incidence rate. The epidemiological situation for this group of infections in Moscow is also stable.

""In Russia, there is a steady downward trend in the incidence of COVID-19: in the last week, 3 thousand cases, which is 20.2 percent less compared to the previous week. There is also a decrease in the incidence of ARVI and influenza by 10.8 percent for the last week. A decrease in the number of hospitalizations was recorded, which amounted to 8.6 percent. At the same time, the activity of influenza B and A(H1N1) viruses remains.

""The situation with the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia is also stable. The incidence rate last week corresponds to the indicators of the previous week and does not exceed the average value for the last month. During this period, there is no significant trend in the number of hospitalized.

""In the course of ongoing epidemiological monitoring and genomic surveillance in the Russian Federation, no new viruses or viruses with significant mutations have been detected.""

It went on: ""The situation is under the strict control of Rospotrebnadzor.

Gennady Onishchenko, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency TASS: ""In St. Petersburg we have the Pasteur Institute, which only deals with influenza, and its official report does not contain any information about any new virus.

""Therefore, let's not brush this information aside, we will carefully decipher it. <...> Most likely, there is no virus there, let's not hype it up now, but let's look at the data of at least one study. The most important thing is where this virus is, where these diseases were registered.""[...] ",1jo9zl5,https://www.newsweek.com/russia-mystery-virus-victims-2052961,486
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743431088.0,"Good riddance flu, fall vaccine plan, fluoride, long Covid research back, and yes, measles (via Your Local Epidemiologist)","**Flu: good riddance to a rough season**

Flu season is finally wrapping up. Across most of the U.S., influenza-like illnesses (fevers, coughs, sore throats) are dipping just below epidemic levels. The exceptions? Maine and New York are still seeing high activity.

It was a rough one. This flu season saw the highest number of hospitalizations in the past 15 years. We’re still waiting on final death counts—especially among kids—but unfortunately, we expect the trend to follow.

What this means for you: While colds circulate year-round, the worst is likely over. Hopefully that means fewer disruptions (and tissues) ahead for your family.

**Fall vaccines: what’s the plan?**

At this time every year, VRBPAC—the external FDA advisory committee for vaccines—determines the flu vaccine formula. Secretary Kennedy canceled this meeting, so we don’t have a U.S. recommendation for the formula. However, manufacturers are still moving forward based on WHO recommendations. This is okay; U.S. recommendations rarely differ.

Similarly, VRBPAC hasn’t determined a Covid-19 vaccine formula for fall. I’m not worried yet for two reasons:

The Covid formula is usually determined in June. This is because the mRNA platform gives us more time—vaccines can be made within 3 months (vs. 6 months for the flu vaccine). This may be bad news for Novavax, which takes 6+ months to manufacture. This brings us to the second point.

Covid-19 hasn’t dramatically changed (although we are keeping an eye on a variant in South Africa), so there’s a good chance the vaccine formula won’t be changed this fall.

ACIP—the external advisory committee for the CDC, which Secretary Kennedy put on hold—has been rescheduled for mid-April. The committee’s purpose is to determine vaccine policy: who should get vaccines (as opposed to what is in the vaccines). This recommendation is very important for insurance coverage. The mid-April meeting covers other vaccines—the flu and Covid vaccine policy is reserved for the June meeting.

What this means for you: Flu and Covid vaccines are still expected this fall. The big question will be: Will they be covered by insurance? Stay tuned.

**Shake up at the FDA**

The most concerning news? Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine official, was told to resign—or be fired—and officially stepped down Friday. He’s served under multiple presidents and helped lead Operation Warp Speed. I personally appreciated his steady head during FDA meetings. (Republicans and Democrats praised his service.) In his resignation letter, Marks warned Secretary Kennedy is not interested in scientific facts, citing “misinformation” and “lies”.

This is incredibly concerning, particularly because it’s following a pattern. Last week, Kevin Griffins—Director of Communication at CDC—resigned citing similar concerns.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743352495.0,RFK Jr. Expected To Lay Off Entire Office Of Infectious Disease And HIV/AIDS Policy,"The U.S. is still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic with more and more long COVID cases emerging. Bird flu is a growing threat. Measles outbreaks have been occurring. Antibiotic-resistant organisms continue to spread in healthcare settings. So what do you do next if you are in charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is supposed to protect the health of humans in the U.S.? How about lay off the entire staff of the U.S. government’s Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy?

**Office of Infectious Disease ‘Gutting’ Is Part Of RFK, Jr.’s Downsizing And Restructuring Of HHS**

Yep, that’s the word from various federal health officials and external experts who work with the OIDP. Alexander Tin reporting for CBS News described it as gutting the OIDP. It’s apparently part of the whole HHS downsizing and restructuring plan with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as the Secretary of HHS that’s been posted as a fact sheet. That fact sheet indicates that the number of HHS employees will be slashed from around 82,000 to 62,000. This will include cutting around 3,500 jobs at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health.

The problem is that the general public may not be fully aware of all that OIDP does and the expertise that will be lost. Chances are that more people are more familiar with the acronym GOT, which stands for Game of Thrones, than the acronym OIDP. But the cuts at HHS are beginning to resemble the plots of GOT in different ways. Each week, it’s not clear who will be gone next.

**OIDP Serves Important Roles In Infectious Disease Prevention And Control**

The stated mission of the OIDP is “to provide strategic leadership and management, while encouraging collaboration, coordination, and innovation among federal agencies and stakeholders to reduce the burden of infectious diseases.” This includes implementing various national plans to prevent and control infectious diseases. For example, there’s the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, Vaccines National Strategic Plan, Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan and the Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan. The OIDP also directs different initiatives such as initiatives to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S., prevent healthcare-associated infections and control tick-borne diseases. Maintaining such plans and initiatives may be kind of difficult with no staff around.

Also potentially going poof are the various advisory committees of external scientific experts that the OIPD has been maintaining. This includes the Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and Availability, Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) and National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC). In fact, sources have told me that the PACCARB has already been disbanded as of Friday.

**RFK, Jr. Has Not Yet Provided A Clear Plan On Who Now Will Handle Different Aspects Of Infectious Disease Control**

Tearing stuff down is a typically whole lot easier than building up things. For example, asking, “Who can trash a house” will probably get more takers such as many of your classmates when you were in high school than asking, “Who can build a house?” By jettisoning the staff and advisors for the OIDP, the federal government will lose years and years of experience and expertise that will be super hard to replace.

Of course, there is the possibility that some of these initiatives, plans and advisory committees will somehow resurface in some other forms in the near future. However, neither RFK, Jr. nor the rest of the Trump Administration have provided a clear and adequately detailed plan to date of how HSS specifically will be reconfigured and what scientific, health and public health efforts will be covered by what part of this new version of HHS and in what way.

For example, no one whom I have talked to at HHS and in the infectious disease community knows where in HHS the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections will eventually reside and how many people will be involved in such efforts. In fact, the word “chaos” has come up frequently in conversations. And chaos would not be a good way to combat infectious pathogens.
The first term of Donald Trump’s presidency should have been a lesson on what can happen when you get rid of or lose experts on preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Recall that in 2018, the Trump Administration disbanded of the Global Health Security and Biodefense unit that was responsible for pandemic preparedness. That same year Timothy Ziemer, the top White House official in the National Security Council for leading U.S. response against a pandemic, departed. And guess what happened less than two years later. Hint, it rhymes with the words “a pandemic.” Imagine how the response to COVID-19, which was often described as chaotic, may have been different had the government kept its pandemic preparedness experts.

**How Will This Affect The Ability Of The U.S. To Deal With Multiple Ongoing Infectious Disease Threats**

It’s never a good time to play around with infectious disease prevention and control capabilities without first having a clear plan. This is particularly not a good time with a range of different ongoing infectious disease threats. Fore example, the U.S. still has no clear long-term strategies on how to deal with COVID-19 and the growing burden of long COVID. Since the COVID pandemic emerged in 2020, there have been repeated attempts by politicians from both major political parties to sweep COVID under the rug rather than deal with it head on as needed. But you can’t sweep under the rug the fact that people are still getting COVID-19, getting COVID-19 brings the risk of long COVID, and there still aren’t enough adequate treatments for this chronic ongoing condition.
Meanwhile, there is apparently still no clear plan on how to deal with H5N1 avian influenza, which has been spreading among other animals and could at some point become a real threat to humans. Even if this bird flu doesn’t eventually become the p-word, other pandemic possibilities will likely emerge in the coming years. How ready will the U.S. government be to deal with them? Hopefully not 2020-ready in hindsight.

At the same time, the problem of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and healthcare-associated infections has continued to grow and grow and grow. Last year, I wrote in Forbes about publications in The Lancet that called for more urgent action against antimicrobial resistance and predicted millions and millions of deaths around the world, including in the U.S., if more isn’t done about this problem.

Then there’s the infectious disease problem that wasn’t a problem in 2000 but has become a problem in 2025 because of a big problem. The big problem is misinformation and disinformation. That has resulted in drops in measles vaccine coverage. As a result, measles, which was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, is no longer that. I have already written in Forbes about the measles outbreaks that have been occurring in Texas, New Mexico and other states and how measles can cause various long-term problem, including death, which is a really long-term problem.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743216674.0,"RFK Jr. forces out Peter Marks, FDA’s top vaccine scientist","The Trump administration on Friday pushed out Peter Marks, the nation’s top vaccine regulator and an architect of the U.S. program to rapidly develop coronavirus vaccines, a move that comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues his overhaul of the nation’s health and science agencies amid a worsening U.S. outbreak of measles.

Marks, who joined the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 and had overseen its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research since 2016, was offered the choice to resign or be fired, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation.

He opted to resign, with an effective departure date of next Friday, April 5.

Marks is leaving his post with a “heavy heart,” he wrote in his resignation letter Friday, which was obtained by The Washington Post. The longtime regulator wrote that he was particularly worried about the measles outbreak in Texas, which “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.”

Reached on Friday night, Marks confirmed that he was leaving FDA but declined to comment on the circumstances. He said that he was particularly worried about the current measles outbreak, which is centered in Texas and has grown to nearly 500 cases.

Kennedy, who in his years as an anti-vaccine activist criticized measles shots and boosted vitamin A as a treatment, is now using his government position to tout the vitamin’s accepted benefits. He has also said that receiving the measles vaccine should be a personal choice. Experts acknowledge that vitamin A can be beneficial after someone has become sickened, but they say it is not a replacement for vaccination to prevent measles.

“It is unconscionable with measles outbreaks to not have a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations,” Marks said.

The FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Two former FDA commissioners praised Marks on Friday night, highlighting his work at the agency. Marks helped conceive of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s program to accelerate the development of coronavirus vaccines, which has been credited with helping end the threat of the covid-19 pandemic. A December 2022 study by the Commonwealth Fund, a health-care foundation, estimated that coronavirus vaccines prevented more than 18.5 million U.S. hospitalizations and 3.2 million deaths.

As head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Marks led a team of experts who were charged with scrutinizing data on vaccines and other medical products before deciding whether to approve them.

“Peter has presided over an extraordinary period of medical progress, spearheading breakthroughs in cell and gene therapy that helped transform the treatment of pediatric leukemia, sickle cell disease, and certain forms of blindness,” said Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner during the first Trump administration.

“Peter’s commitment to bringing the best science and data to the development and availability of lifesaving biomedical technologies, from gene and cell therapies to the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed, has saved countless lives,” said Mark McClellan, who served as FDA commissioner during the George W. Bush administration. “His decade-long leadership at the FDA is a big reason why the FDA is the gold standard for advancing the most innovative breakthrough medicines.”

In his resignation letter, Marks also said that he had been willing to work with Kennedy on the health secretary’s planned efforts to review vaccine safety. Kennedy has repeatedly suggested that there could be a link between vaccines and autism — a claim that has been repeatedly debunked — and called for further study.

“However, it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote.
Gottlieb lamented the departure of Marks and other top officials from the health department, warning that it would undermine future efforts to fight diseases and develop new therapies.

“We’re failing to appreciate the people and institutions who’ve propelled these remarkable advances, undermining them without offering credible alternatives, and risking the loss of future breakthroughs that many patients are counting on,” Gottlieb said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743272924.0,"Rate of new measles cases in Ontario stable, says province's top doctor","Ontario’s measles outbreak is likely to continue into the summer, the province’s chief medical officer of health said Friday, but a stable rate of new cases is a hopeful sign that it will not worsen.

Measles is so contagious that one infected person can spread it to 16 others, but the province is not seeing that growth rate at the moment, Dr. Kieran Moore said in an interview. This week there were just over 100 new cases and 120 new ones the week before that, he said.


**“Normally, in an outbreak (it) would go in a very escalating, rapid fashion, but we’re seeing stable numbers week after week, which gives us hope,” he said.**

“This virus typically spreads in late winter and through spring, and we’re finding that it’s not accelerating. So that’s probably thanks to the great work in communities to try to limit spread, as well as our messaging with local public health agencies to affected communities and health system preparedness.” 

Public Health Ontario says there have been 572 cases since the outbreak began in October — 453 of them confirmed and 119 probable. Of the 42 people requiring hospitalization, two have required intensive care, and 36 have been children — most of them unvaccinated.

Moore wrote in a memo to local medical officers of health earlier this month that the **measles outbreak is “disproportionately” affecting some Mennonite, Amish and other Anabaptist communities due to under-immunization and exposure.** The origin of the outbreak was a large gathering with guests from Mennonite communities in New Brunswick last fall, he wrote.

He said Friday that the “vast majority” of Ontario’s cases are among people in those communities, and local public health units are focusing on outreach to try to contain the spread. Unvaccinated infants, kids and teenagers in the Southwestern and Grand Erie public health units are most affected. 

“(The health units) have always had a strong relationship with these communities, and have continued the communication,” Moore said, including communications in Low German, spoken by some Mennonites. 

“They have advertised on some of the Low German radios. They’ve translated their documents into Low German to ensure that they can be understood at community level…We call it the ground game. The ground game outbreak is where all the work has to happen and all the communication and collaboration.”

The Ontario Liberals have urged Moore and Premier Doug Ford to more publicly deliver public health messaging on measles.

“The premier and his chief medical officer of health need to tell the people of Ontario their plan to fight measles,” public health critic Adil Shamji wrote in a statement.

“The government of the day should not have to be told to take action. It should be leaping into action. Anything less will put thousands of lives at risk.”

Moore said he is not planning a press conference. Local medical officers of health have been the public lead on the issue, and some medical experts have been doing television interviews about measles, he said. 

“We know our partners at Public Health Ontario are experts that are helping us with this outbreak, (and) have had good communication,” he said.

“We monitor the effectiveness of our communication, and we’re happy with how this is being covered, how the press has really raised the awareness of this, both at a national level and within Ontario.”

There have been measles cases outside the most-affected health units, but many are linked to global travel and have not spread locally, Moore said.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. The World Health Organization says the virus can remain active in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours.

It usually begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body and limbs. The virus can lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.

**Texas and New Mexico report more cases**

In an update today, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 73 more cases, with one more patient hospitalized. Given the highly contagious nature of the virus, the TDSHS said it expects more cases to be reported in affected and surrounding areas.

Cases have been reported from 17 Texas counties, mostly from Gaines County and surrounding counties in the western part of the state. However, 10 cases have been reported from Lamar County in eastern Texas on the Oklahoma border.

Only 2 of Texas’ 400 patients were known to have received two recommended measles vaccine doses, and the rest had unknown status or were unvaccinated.

In a related development, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDH) today reported 1 more case in its outbreak, which is linked to the Texas outbreak, raising the state’s total to 44 cases. New Mexico’s cases are from Lea and Eddy counties. 

Of New Mexico’s patients, 4 had at least one measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine dose, 32 were unvaccinated, and 8 had an unknown vaccination status.

Two earlier deaths were reported in measles patients from the two states.

**New Jersey issues exposure alert**

The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) today issued an alert about potential exposures related to two unrelated confirmed measles cases in people who aren’t residents of the state.

Its warning detailed two locations, one an Amtrack Northeast Regional Train that traveled from New York’s Penn Station to Washington, DC, on March 19 and the other Capital Health Medical Center in Pennington, NJ, on March 22. 

“NJDOH is working in collaboration with local health officials on ongoing contact tracing and efforts to notify people who might have been exposed and to identify additional exposures that may have occurred,” the group said.

**US total nears 500 cases**

In its weekly update today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 105 more cases, pushing the national total to 483. Two more jurisdictions have reported cases, bringing that total to 20.

Two more outbreaks are reflected in the total, putting the total at five. Of the 483 cases, 93% (447) are part of outbreaks. Earlier this week, Kansas and Ohio added cases to their outbreak totals, and Oklahoma has reported nine cases, 7 confirmed and 2 probable, in an outbreak linked to the Texas outbreak.

Several states have also reported imported cases among international travelers, part of a global rise in measles activity.

Of people infected in the United States, 97% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status.

Cases this year are tracking well above the 285 cases reported for all of 2024 and are at the highest level since 2019 when 1,249 cases were reported. Most of those cases were reported in underimmunized, close-knit communities, including two outbreaks in New York’s Orthodox Jewish communities.

The surge in cases that year, the highest since 1992, threatened the United States’ measles elimination status.",1jm5epg,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-measles-cases-approach-500-worst-year-2019,268
contagioncuriosity,losangelestimes,1743112137.0,A pediatrician’s dilemma: Should a practice kick out unvaccinated kids?,">With the first two U.S. measles deaths in a decade, a growing outbreak in Texas, and eight cases already in California this year, physicians are in a quandary over whether they should dismiss the children of anti-vaccine parents from their practices.  
  
On the one hand, turning them away might limit the risk of exposure for other patients who may not be old enough to get their shots. But on the other, keeping vaccine-hesitant families in the practice gives pediatricians the chance to persuade families to get their children vaccinated down the road.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743080019.0,"Some measles patients in West Texas show signs of vitamin A toxicity, doctors say, raising concerns about misinformation","Doctors treating people hospitalized as part of a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico have also found themselves facing another problem: vitamin A toxicity.

At Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, near the outbreak’s epicenter, several patients have been found to have abnormal liver function on routine lab tests, a probable sign that they’ve taken too much of the vitamin, according to Dr. Lara Johnson, pediatric hospitalist and chief medical officer for Covenant Health-Lubbock Service Area.

The hospitalized children with the toxicity were all unvaccinated.

US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has centered his response to the outbreak on vitamin A, even suggesting in a Fox News interview that it could work “as a prophylaxis.”

But overuse of vitamin A can have serious health consequences, and there is no evidence that it can prevent measles. [...] 

“While vitamin A plays an important role in supporting overall immune function, research hasn’t established its effectiveness in preventing measles infection. CRN is concerned about reports of high-dose vitamin A being used inappropriately, especially in children,” the statement says.

Johnson said she has seen people who were taking vitamin A for measles treatment as well as for prevention. She doesn’t know exactly where these patients heard that they should be taking a lot of vitamin A, she said, but the approach is heavily discussed on social media.

“It’s coming out of the health and wellness … influencer industry that downplays the importance of vaccines and tries to promote various spectacular cures like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or vitamin A,” Hotez said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1743109044.0,HHS hit with massive cuts under new Kennedy plan,"Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today announced plans to cut an additional 10,000 federal health jobs among the 82,000 employees who currently work at HHS. With these cuts and previous layoffs, the agency will have roughly 62,000 employees. 

HHS has 28 divisions, which will be consolidated to 15 divisions under the restructuring. Kennedy said the restructuring was an effort to limit the bureaucracy that was hindering Americans' health. Regional offices will also be reduced, from 10 to 5.

Notably, the Food and Drug Administration will see 3,500 jobs cut, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will lose 2,400 staff, the National Institutes of Health will see 1,200 jobs cut, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to lose 300 employees. HHS said the reorganization will not diminish Medicare and Medicaid services.

Kennedy claims cuts will save $2 billion a year 
""HHS has more than 100 communication offices and more than 40 IT [information technology] departments,"" Kennedy said in a video message explaining the cuts. ""In many cases they don’t even talk to each other.""

Throughout the 6-minute video, Kennedy said HHS is full of “fiefdoms” with infighting and misplaced contributing to a decline in public health as more Americans suffer from chronic diseases.

""As part of President Trump's DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] workforce reduction initiate, we are going to streamline HHS to make our agency more efficient and more effective,"" Kennedy said. ""We are going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies, while preserving their core functions by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Health America, or AHA.""

Though Kennedy acknowledged this will likely be a ""painful period,"" he promised the cuts would be aimed at administrators, and AHA would increase the number of scientists and frontline health providers. He said the cuts will help save tax payers nearly $2 billion per year, and will help HHS become the envy of the world.

**ASPR to move to CDC**

Contained within AHA will be the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), responsible for national disaster and public health emergency response, will move to the CDC.

Within hours of the announcement, Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the cuts will likely be challenged in court, and many could be illegal.

Both news comes as new CDC research shows routine childhood immunizations remained below prepandemic levels 3 years after the COVID-19 pandemic began. 

Minnesota’s first measles case-patient in 2025 was traveling Washington, DC, when diagnosed as having measles, and officials said the person may have exposed countless others to the highly infectious virus, including passengers on an Amtrak train. The Washington Post reported the person was not contagious when they flew from Minneapolis to Dulles International Airport. 

The patient was fully vaccinated against the virus. The United States is now approaching 400 measles cases this year, spurred by an ongoing outbreak among mostly unvaccinated children in West Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. 

Geier, Kennedy, committed to vaccine and autism link
Yesterday the New York Times reported doctors in West Texas said they seeing children with signs of liver damage due to ingesting too much vitamin A in an effort to prevent and cure measles. Vitamin A, typically found in cod liver oil, has been falsely promoted by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as a way to prevent measles. 

Last night, it was reported Kennedy’s HHS has hired David Geier to study a purported link between vaccines and autism according to the Washington Post. Geier, who has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license, has long claimed vaccines cause autism, and has published several papers with his father, physician Mark Geier, on the topic.

**David Geier does not have a medical degree or any degree in advanced science.**

In a statement given to the Washington Post, Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation said, “It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t. They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done.

**Childhood vaccination rates down**

In related research news, a study today in Pediatrics shows that, more than 3 years after the COVID-19 pandemic started, coverage for selected routine childhood immunizations remained below prepandemic levels.

The study was based on infants born between January 1, 2018 and May 31, 2023, with at least at least one medical visit between 9 and 12 months at 1 of 8 Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) health systems.

The VSD is the CDC’s main project monitoring vaccine safety and adverse events. A total of 395,143 infants were included in the study, which looked at uptake of rotavirus (RV), diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) vaccines.

The authors evaluated coverage with 2 doses of RV, DTaP, and PCV vaccines at 5 months, and completion of recommended doses by 12 months. Coverage for 2 doses of all 3 vaccines at 5 months was 87.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.9 to 88.7) in February 2020 and had dropped to 80.8% (95% CI, 79.8 to 81.8) in October 2023.

In January 2020 vaccine series completion at 12 months was 92.3% (95% CI, 91.6 to 92.9) and 89.6% (95% CI, 88.8 to 90.3) in October 2023.

“Demographic factors, which may reflect structural barriers to accessing care, likely affected coverage,” the authors said, as Black children and those on Medicaid saw the biggest drop in vaccination rates after the pandemic.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742997363.0,"Saying ‘pandemic is over,’ NIH starts cutting COVID-19 research","The White House appears to have a new target for its cuts to research funding: Grants linked to COVID-19, which President Donald Trump and his appointees have decided are a waste of money because the pandemic is over.

Science has learned that grant termination letters went out last night to principal investigators of 29 awards made by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), including nine grants that were part of a program hoping to deliver antiviral drugs to prevent future pandemics. “The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grant funds,” the notification states. “These grant funds were issued for a limited purpose: to ameliorate the effects of the pandemic. Now that the pandemic is over, the grant funds are no longer necessary.”

NIAID did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the grant cancellations, but a spokesperson for its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), sent Science an emailed statement. “The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” it said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

One major NIAID program that began in May 2022 and was just killed, Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern, promised to spend $577 million on nine U.S.-based efforts to develop new drugs to treat COVID-19. Part of that program was also aimed at designing antivirals to target entire families of disease-causing viruses, including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever), filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg), flaviviruses (yellow fever, dengue, Zika), paramyxoviruses (measles), picornaviruses (common cold), and togaviruses (chikungunya). The termination of the program has a “misleading rationale” and is a “pointless, ill-advised move that will hurt U.S. science and pandemic readiness,” says Charles Rice, a Nobel Prize–winning virologist at Rockefeller University who co-leads one of the nine centers that was funded under that program.

Other terminated grants involved research to develop improved COVID-19 vaccines and to address Long Covid, the mysterious lingering aftermath of some SARS-CoV-2 infections. “The research is being treated like we already have all the answers we will need in the future and that the current vaccines work well enough and don’t need improvement, which we know is not true,” says an investigator involved with one of the NIAID grants who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “Some of the studies being canceled were attempting to make a pancoronavirus vaccine, which would hopefully be available the next time a novel coronavirus jumps species into humans.”

According to the grant termination letter Rice and colleagues received, the researchers were told they could appeal but were discouraged from trying to fight the termination. “Although ‘[the National Institutes of Health] generally will suspend (rather than immediately terminate) a grant and allow the recipient an opportunity to take appropriate corrective action before NIH makes a termination decision,’ no corrective action is possible here,” the termination notice said. “The premise of this award is incompatible with agency priorities, and no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities.”

Science has separately learned that at least two of the eight federally funded Serological Sciences Centers of Excellence were terminated. This network was set up to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, what leads to its transmission between people, and what drives disease progression in the infected. The U.S. National Cancer Institute–organized program involved 26 institutions, from academic labs to hospitals, and had been authorized to receive more than $150 million from an emergency congressional appropriation made in 2020.

On top of the terminated NIH research grants, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun cutting $11.4 billion in pandemic response funds allocated to state and country health departments and nongovernmental organizations, according to NBC News. HHS provided NBC News with the same statement about the pandemic being over.",1jkccut,https://www.science.org/content/article/saying-pandemic-over-nih-institute-starts-cutting-covid-19-research,204
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742937766.0,When the government becomes a health misinformation superspreader,"Kevin Griffis was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s office of communications from 2022 until last week.

Friday was my last day leading communications at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I left my job because I believe public health policy must always be guided by facts and not fantasy.

Upon his confirmation last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. inherited a reformed and revamped CDC. As we moved past the height of the covid-19 pandemic, the agency took stock of its shortcomings and launched initiatives to improve its communications (among other areas), with a particular focus on internal coordination. Our goal was to communicate faster and more clearly.
America’s federal public health messaging has not always gotten everything right, but health-care providers and the broader public could have confidence that recommendations were made after careful effort to understand and apply the best available science.

Consider the case of the Missouri resident who tested positive for avian flu in August.

The individual, who had no known exposure to livestock or wild birds, was hospitalized for gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had a history of chronic respiratory illness. A test in the hospital was positive for Flu A, which was later confirmed to be avian flu. The state then traced everyone the patient could have exposed and who had symptoms around the same time.

 They turned up six health-care workers and a family member who was also sick.

The facts raised a critical question: Were we seeing, for the first time in the United States, human-to-human transmission of a virus that historically kills about half of infected people? The case was complex, but it was vital to convey what we knew — and did not know — about the answer.
CDC scientists painstakingly tested the blood of the exposed individuals, using multiple types of assays. The health-care workers tested negative, but the results from the positive individual and the family member were complicated. CDC communicators worked with the agency’s infectious-disease experts to prepare materials that told the story of the case. We walked reporters through the details, spending hours answering questions. We also held a call for scientists and livestock health experts across the country to talk through the details with CDC scientists and key leaders.

The results of the testing and the epidemiological data gathered about the family members supported a single, common exposure to avian flu and not human-to-human transmission. That meant the CDC’s risk assessment for the general public remained low. All this was done to help providers and the public better understand a mystery involving a dangerous virus.

It’s hard to overstate how different things are today.
Now, public health communications have slowed to trickle. The CDC hasn’t held a public briefing, despite multiple disease outbreaks, since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Instead of seeking guidance about how to combat the measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico from the world-leading epidemiologists and virologists he oversees, Kennedy is listening to fringe voices who reinforce his personal beliefs. Kennedy has promoted unproven treatments for measles, such as the antibiotic clarithromycin — a drug that has no effect on viral infections. He also suggested distributing Vitamin A, which does not prevent measles.
Meanwhile, in my final weeks at the CDC, I watched as career infectious-disease experts were tasked with spending precious hours searching medical literature in vain for data to support Kennedy’s preferred treatments.

All this misdirection is a waste of federal dollars that will do nothing to control the outbreak. It also could cost lives.

Public health communications should be about empowering people with reliable, science-based information, so they can make their own health decisions. Unfortunately, we can’t count on Kennedy’s HHS for that anymore.

It is painful to say this, given my time in government service, but the United States urgently needs a strong alternative to the government public health guidance it has relied on in the past. I urge public health experts to come together to invest in organizations that provide independent, trustworthy sources of information on vital public health matters.

This could take on many forms. But to be successful and durable, it’s essential that any such effort foster two-way communication. Without feedback from affected communities, it’s harder to know what concerns people have and where information is missing. Also needed are accessible online resources, written in language that’s clear and easy to understand. Finally, given how people seek and consume health information, we need coordinated networks of experts, scientists and providers willing to share and amplify accurate information in real time via their social media platforms.

In short, the effort needs to match the scope and energy of the entities spreading bad information — including, unfortunately, parts of the U.S. government.
My first-hand experience over the recent troubling weeks convinced me thatKennedy and his team are working to bend science to fit their own narratives, rather than allowing facts to guide policy. Let’s act now to ensure that the American people continue to have access to reliable, reality-based information they need to protect their health.",1jjurcs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/25/rfk-hhs-cdc-public-health-misinformation-spread/,747

The list contains 24 pathogen families, providing rankings of high, moderate, or low regarding pandemic and epidemic potential. The HSA said its scientists took into account transmission routes and disease severity.

In a statement, the agency said the ratings aren't intended as a detailed threat assessment and don't indicate which pathogen is most likely to trigger then next pandemic, but rather which ones require increased scientific investments and study. The rankings also highlight which pathogens need increased diagnostics and vaccine development and which may be exacerbated by changing climate or antimicrobial resistance. Officials said the tool will be updated, based on scientific developments.

Pathogens with high pandemic potential include coronaviruses, the Orthomyxoviridae group that includes avian flu, the Paramyxoviridae group that includes Nipah virus, and the Picornaviridae that includes enterovirus D68.

As per reports, a woman residing in Greater Noida succumbed to rabies after contracting the infection via cow milk. The reports have said that the cow had rabies after being bitten by a stray dog.

While a few people from the nearby area sought rabies vaccination, the woman did not take precaution. A few days after consuming the milk she developed symptoms. ""In a desperate attempt to save her, family members rushed her to multiple hospitals, but she was repeatedly turned away. Eventually, doctors at the district hospital advised them to take her home. She died shortly after,"" News18 reported.

Can rabies spread through milk?
-------------------------------
""Milk of rabid animal (cows and buffaloes) has rabies virus. If such milk is consumed without boiling, there is a risk,"" says a report by ICAR. The report categorises ""Person drinking unboiled milk"" as category 1 based on risk of rabies. Other incidents put under this category are getting licked by an infected animal, getting lick on intact mucous membrane --mouth, nose, anus, genitalia and conjunctiva and getting bitten without blood. ""Classification of patients according to the nature of the bite is very important. The decision for treatment, post bite AR Vaccination and administering of immunoglobulin are decided basing on the classification. Depending on severity, the patients are classified in to three Categories viz., Category I, Category II and Category III. Vaccination is indicated for Category II and III patients,"" the report says.

""The rabies virus infects the brain. Once the rabies virus reaches the brain and symptoms begin to show, at this stage the infection is virtually untreatable and usually fatal within days and death results,"" ICAR says.

Commentary by ProMed:

**[The report above does not explain if the bitten cow exhibited any symptoms of rabies.]**

""Rabies virus can be transmitted by direct contact with infected material, such as saliva from an animal infected with rabies, and mucous membranes, including the oral and gastric mucosae. In addition to saliva and neural tissue, rabies virus also has been detected in the kidney, prostate, pancreas, and other tissues and body fluids. However, saliva and neural tissue are the primary proven vehicles for rabies virus in naturally occurring cases. Anecdotal reports exist of rabies transmission by ingestion of milk from rabid animals (e.g., from a rabid sheep to a nursing lamb). In these reports, the more conventional routes (e.g., bite or mucous membrane exposure) could not be completely excluded.

""Transmission of rabies virus in unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible. The risk could be defined better if samples of milk and mammary tissue were collected from rabid livestock and assayed for the presence, viability, and infectivity of rabies virus. Regardless of the amount of viable rabies virus that may be shed in cows' milk, the theoretical risk for transmission of rabies from this route can be eliminated if all dairy products are pasteurized before consumption."" (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056759.htm).

**It is highly unlikely that the deceased woman developed rabies after consuming the cow's milk.** A thorough investigation is, however, warranted to know whether she had any open wounds which were contaminated with saliva of the rabid cow. This would likely be a way of transmission of the virus from the infected cow to the woman who reportedly succumbed to rabies.",1jiq5ug,https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8723089,950

Over the weekend, a shadow CDC page on vaccines and autism (called the realcdc[.]org) was revealed. It looks exactly like an official CDC page—the same branding, fonts, and style. The difference was that it had false information about MMR vaccines causing autism, including videos of parent testimonials.

Here’s the kicker: This shadow site was hosted by Children’s Health Defense (CHD)— a non-profit, anti-vaxx organization started by Secretary Kennedy.

What they were going to do with this page is unclear, but we can imagine a number of scenarios, including directing Americans toward false information. As the New York Times found, RFK Jr. quickly asked them to take it down. Regardless, this confirms that CHD is backhanded, dishonest, and deceitful. The site is now inactive, but I bet it’s not the last we see of it.

What does this mean to you? It’s clear now more than ever that we are in an information storm with people’s health at stake. There are a lot of legitimate-looking news websites that are actually just organizations masking as something else. [...] 

**Flu: We’re on the way out (mostly)**

Influenza-like illnesses—cough, fever, runny nose—are packing their bags. While it’s still high in the Northeast and Northwest (probably because it’s still a bit cold), levels are moderate to low across the U.S. overall.

One strain of flu—Influenza A—showed its teeth this winter but continues its steep decline. We sometimes see an increase this time of year of another flu strain—Influenza B. This year it has increased slightly but not enough to disrupt the overall downward trend.

What it means to you: The end of flu season is just around the corner.

**Measles: The comeback tour no one asked for**

Measles continues to be a problem. As of Saturday, the U.S. had 407 measles cases across 19 states, 355 of which are associated with the outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

Lubbock’s Public Health Director warned that the panhandle outbreak could take a year to contain. She’s probably right, but boots on the ground will do everything possible to prevent that. If this outbreak takes more than 12 months to contain, the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status—a title we’ve held for 25 years.

Another outbreak popped up in Kansas—up to 10 cases in two counties. This may be connected to the Texas outbreak, but there is no confirmation yet.

In the past week, we’ve also seen sporadic measles cases in the following places from international travel:

Maryland: 2 at Prince George’s County

Virginia: 1 at Dulles airport

California: 1 in Fresno and 2 in Tuolumne County

Ohio: Ashtabula County

Washington: King County

What does this mean to you? You are very well protected if you’re up to date on your MMR vaccine. If you’re in a hot zone, especially with a child under 12 months old, remain vigilant by following updates from your local health department.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742817168.0,Ontario measles outbreak traced to Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick,"A measles outbreak that has infected scores of unvaccinated children in southwestern Ontario reportedly had its start at a Mennonite religious gathering in New Brunswick last year.

In a March 7 letter to Ontario’s health units, the province’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, said there was “an exposure at a large gathering with guests from Mennonite communities in New Brunswick last fall.”

Guests at that gathering unwittingly brought the virus back to southwestern Ontario, mainly the region bordering Norfolk, Oxford and Elgin counties, which has a sizeable conservative Mennonite population.

Measles cases then emerged in Manitoba when Mennonites from that province returned home after visiting family in Ontario, Moore said.

Health officials previously said measles entered Canada on Oct. 16 of last year when an infected traveller flew to New Brunswick from the Philippines, with stops in Vancouver and Toronto. But how the highly contagious respiratory virus got to southwestern Ontario had been unclear prior to Moore’s memorandum.

The latest report from Public Health Ontario, released on Thursday, says Southwestern Public Health has seen 223 confirmed measles cases since last October, with another 111 cases in Grand Erie.

Taken together, those outbreaks account for almost three-quarters of Ontario’s confirmed cases, nearly all of which are in unvaccinated residents, Moore said.",1jiot6s,https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/ontario-measles-outbreak-traced-to-mennonite-gathering-in-new-brunswick/article_1f457535-c1fa-59e2-8b8a-e798ead039cd.html,238

Health officials only identified the person as a resident and didn't specify whether it was an adult or a child. The likely source of the infection is being investigated, health officials said.

Officials said the person was infected in early March and recovering at home. Public health officials are working to identify other places and people potentially exposed.

There is currently an ongoing, national measles outbreak, involving over 300 cases in 11 states, including two deaths.

**TOPEKA (KSNT)** – State health officials report the number of measles cases is growing in Kansas this year as cases climb nationwide.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported on March 20 on its website that a total of 10 confirmed measles cases are confirmed in the state. All of the cases are being reported in people who are below the age of 17 with the majority in the five to 10-year-old age group.

**COLUMBUS** — Ohio’s first case of measles for 2025 was reported in an infected adult who was not vaccinated in Ashtabula County this week, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

“The fact that we now have a measles case in Ohio adds emphasis to the importance of being fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health.

Ohio had 90 cases of measles in 2022, when an outbreak was centered in central Ohio. The state had one measles case in 2023 and seven in 2024.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742678224.0,Surviving Ebola in Liberia: 10 stories of pain and hope,"A decade after the worst of the virus’ 40 outbreaks killed 11,300 people, individuals who still bear its physical and mental scars speak out.

Josephine Karwah lost her mother, father and sister Salomé. Her child was born dead, in the street, on the way to the hospital. No one wanted to help a mother who had contracted Ebola, the lethal virus that claimed the lives of entire families. Sitting in front of the small clinic she now runs in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, Karwah picks up her phone and opens a WhatApp group. It has 81 members, all of whom suffered from Ebola except for one, a doctor who sometimes offers medical advice. The rest share their pain and sometimes, happiness. 

Ten years have passed since the virus decimated their country, but the group remains in contact. The majority of them still experience physical consequences from the disease: pain in their joints, problems with their eyesight. 

The group is called All Survivors. Here in Monrovia, the sea is once again playing tricks and has risen up to West Point, the city’s largest shanty town, where the streets are so narrow one has to walk sideways. After it recedes, it leaves a blanket of sand, plastic, and dirt on top of which young children play and slightly older kids prepare fish. It’s Sunday, and there is no market. [...] 

The Ebola virus was detected for the first time in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and led to at least 40 outbreaks. The worst of these started in a village near Conakry, the capital of Guinea, in December 2013 and rapidly spread throughout Liberia and Sierra Leone. The virus killed 11,300 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, including 500 health professionals. It seemed to disappear in June 2016, leaving behind some 17,000 survivors.

The primary sources of contagion, according to nurse Luis Encinas, were funeral rites, care providers and health centers where there were no adequate protective measures enforced at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition to large gathering places such as markets and churches. “The number of infections multiplied because there were not enough ambulances and potential patients had to be transported in unsafe conditions, such as on motorbikes, that did not allow for safe distancing, or in private vehicles that were not properly disinfected afterwards. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) sounded the alarm, but international warnings were not issued until many months later, when thousands were already dead,” he adds.

Years of war that preceded the outbreaks had created healthcare deserts in Liberia. A study by the University of Washington revealed that up to 67% of essential primary care in the country evaporated during and immediately following the epidemic. On June 9, 2016, the World Health Organization declared the end of Liberia’s outbreak. Though the capital had been the worst hit, every one of the country’s 15 counties had registered cases. Thousands survived. Many had sought care in the Ebola treatment center that MSF had built in Monrovia. These are some of their stories.


1. Josephine Karwah: “We had to bury her at night”

Josephine Karwah is an Ebola survivor. She returned home in September 2014, one of the few pregnant people who had been able to defeat the virus. “The neighbors didn’t even want to see me, I was traumatized,” she remembers. When she went into labor, she decided to go to a health center, but wasn’t able to find anyone who would bring her there. “I had my son in the street. No one wanted to help me, even though I had a certificate saying I had been cured. In the end, some women formed a circle around me. My baby was born dead. I returned to my house on foot with him wrapped in a towel.” Karwah lost her parents to Ebola, as well as her nephews and her uncle. Then Salomé, her beloved baby sister, also died. Salomé had worked as a nurse in their parents’ clinic, located an hour by car from Monrovia. She had beaten the virus and located the strength to return to the clinic where she’d watched their parents die, offering her services as a care provider and mental health counselor.

Time found Karwah’s triple role as survivor, health worker and advocate so astounding, it put her on the magazine’s cover. She was named the publication’s person of the year in 2014. Three years later, in February 2017, Salomé died. Three days had passed since she’d given birth to her fourth child, Salomon, when she began to feel poorly. Her husband James immediately brought her to the hospital. She was foaming at the mouth and when they discovered she was an Ebola survivor, no one would attend her. “It took them 45 minutes to admit her, while she was bleeding to death,” Josephine says on the way to the cemetery where her sister is buried. “There were irregularities. And after her death, the case became politicized. The government opened an investigation. The medication my sister needed was not available, that was the conclusion of the investigation. Nobody wanted to touch her or dress her for the funeral, even though her autopsy has been negative for Ebola. We had to bury her at night.”

Karwah breaks down in tears. There has been so much pain, too many ugly stares. Like Salomé, she is a nurse and runs the clinic their parents founded before they died, Karwah’s Memorial Healthcare Center. On a press tour in Amsterdam during which she shared what had happened to her, she received treatment for her eye problems, but she says she continues to lose more of her vision every day. “The stigma continues. Recently I attended a wedding and someone recorded me. You can hear in the video how they refer to me as the Ebola nurse,” she says. Josephine and Salomé's parents are not here, in this small cemetery on the highway to the airport. Like the rest of those who died during the hardest months of the Ebola epidemic, they were cremated. Facing criticism, U.S. agencies bought property on which to bury the dead. Today, their parents’ ashes are there, mixed with those of hundreds of others, along with the corpses of those who were able to be buried. A few miles away at Karwah’s parents’ clinic, a pregnant woman waits to be attended. It’s noon and the sun bakes the building’s aging walls. On them hang posters with recommendations about how to fight Covid and avoid another disease, Lassa fever. Not a single poster addresses Ebola.

2. Zaizay Mulbah: “They told me we wouldn’t live more than five years, but now I’m stronger than ever”

Zaizay Mulbah, 44, was born in Monrovia’s Congo Town neighborhood. He was a very healthy young man, but one day, he found that his eyes appeared to be full of blood. He couldn’t believe it, but he tested positive. He stayed at an in-patient clinic for two weeks, was cured and wanted to help other patients to overcome the virus as part of the MSF psychological support team. He shared his story to demonstrate that Ebola was not a death sentence. “I myself would not be alive if I hadn’t received this kind of support,” he says. Previously, Mulbah participated in Prevail, a research project developed by the United States in collaboration with the Liberian government. “I went every week, then every month and then every trimester. They took my blood, checked my eyes. I also worked there for eight years doing follow-up with other patients,” he says. “What had we learned from Ebola when Covid came? Hygiene protocols. But the Liberian health system is so fragile that if a new disease comes, the disaster will be worse,” he warns.

Today he works as a driver for a state agency that administers petroleum in the central area of Monrovia. He has a spouse and three children. He starts work at 5 a.m. and gets off at 9 p.m., for $350 a month. His wife doesn’t work. He says that physically, he’s better than ever. Today he’s part of the coaching staff of the national volleyball team, a sport of whose federation his father was once president. “They told me we wouldn’t live more than five years, but today I’m stronger than ever,” he says.

3. Musu Kennedy: “It has taken me years to recover from Ebola. I am not afraid”

Ten years without thinking about it, a voluntary memory erasure. Her recollections are so terrifying that Musu Kennedy can’t even cry when she shows a photo in which she appears surrounded by doctors dressed in protective suits at Elwa-3, the center that held up to 250 beds and had been set up by MSF in Monrovia to treat people infected with Ebola.

It was November 2014 and the number of patients and victims had risen into the thousands. In Liberia, 10,212 cases had been confirmed, with 4,573 dead. Kennedy was taking care of 11-year-old Siah as though she was her own daughter. Siah was a unique patient, and Kennedy decided to stay in that hellscape for a few more days after she was declared cured, to care for Siah. The two left together, both negative, and headed to their respective homes. They never saw each other again. “If you find her, tell her that I miss her. I stayed with her back then because she was so young, her parents had died. I knew it, but she didn’t: she never stopped asking for her mother,” says 41-year-old Kennedy, a mother of three children who are now 24, 23 and 13 years old.

Kennedy is now a grandmother, living with her granddaughter in a home to which a skinny dog welcomes visitors, stretching without getting up from a pillow printed with the anime character Doraemon. Talking about Ebola is horrible for Kennedy. She believes that it’s the virus’ fault that she hasn’t been able to have more children. “I began to bleed, I lost my appetite and things started to appear on my skin. When I came home, only my husband supported me.” For the last few months, they’ve lived in a small house near the main highway of the Liberian capital. Kennedy is Christian and her life is the church, she goes every day. “My husband is the pastor, I direct the choir and I’m the mother of the church, I take care of the sick,” she says. She begins to sing in a powerful voice: “What is so hard that God cannot do it for me?” She says that today, she is especially happy. She feels blessed by the visit. “It’s taken me years to recover from Ebola. I am not afraid,” she says.


4. Comfort Paye: “I would like it if the government built medical centers”
Ebola, Liberia

Comfort Paye says she was born in 1972. “So, I am 53 years old,” she says in a faint voice. “And yes, I am an Ebola survivor.” While one of her young grandsons plays with a tub of water and another runs around, sucking on the plug of a mobile phone, Paye tells her story. First her sister was infected and died. Then, the baby, and finally, Paye found herself in an isolation center. She took medication and days later was finally able to go home. That’s where another nightmare began: she received word that she had to move. “They discriminated against me and branded me an Ebola victim,” she says.

And now? “Now everyone has forgotten it,” she says. But not her. Paye’s arms and legs still hurt, though she doesn’t go to the doctor because she doesn’t have the money for consultations or medicine. Although she still appears to possess certain fortitude, Paye swears that before the virus, she was a stronger woman. “Not anymore. I would like it if the government built medical centers,” she says. While she speaks, her three grandkids careen about and her husband listens from behind her. Is there a lot of sexism in the community? Paye delivers her answer with her eyes downcast. “Men have more rights,” she says. “If the man makes a decision in a meeting at home, that is the final decision.”

The three children pose proudly for the camera alongside their grandmother. Silence reigns in her community, located 40 minutes by car from downtown Monrovia. It’s mealtime, but no food has been prepared.

5. Beatrice Yardolo: “I was the last survivor of Ebola in Liberia. The government gave me an envelope with $200”

Beatrice Yardolo, the last patient of Liberia’s largest outbreak. She is 69.

Beatrice Yardolo was an English teacher for 15 years. She was born and raised in Loyee Town, some 233 miles north of Monrovia. Initially, she wanted to be a nurse, but that dream was never fulfilled, in part due to the civil war that ravaged Liberia for nearly two decades until 2003, and in part due to a lack of money.

This morning, like all other mornings since she beat Ebola, her joints hurt. Her aching hands hold two photos, each of a child that the virus took from her, Elaisha and Steve. Her niece Amanda was the first to be infected and die. Then her daughter got sick as well. Little by little, she herself began to feel poorly, experiencing diarrhea and vomiting. Yardolo was admitted to the treatment center between February and March of 2015. “I was the last patient at the center, I was alone and scared,” she remembers.

It’s easier to flee the weapons of war than this invisible enemy

Yardolo was officially the last survivor of the country’s massive outbreak. Like so many others, despite being cured, she later experienced painful rejection from her community. When she returned home, she slept by herself in an isolated room. The neighbors wouldn’t let her touch the water supply. Then the country’s president at the time, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, appeared at her house. “She gave me an envelope with $200. She was here less than an hour and left,” she says. Yardolo is now 69 and insists that she continues to experience a lot of pain in her hands and legs. “This mortal disease has caused so many problems for families. It’s easier to flee the weapons of war than this invisible enemy,” she says.

6. Jackson Slown: “I experienced a lot of discrimination and lost my job”

Jackson Slown, 58 years old, was infected himself before Ebola took his mother.

“Physically, I’m OK, but I’ve lost my memory. When I got the disease, I was a security guard. Later, I experienced a lot of discrimination and lost my job.” The 58-year-old Jackson Slown also lost his wife to Ebola. He got the disease first. She brought him to the Ebola treatment unit and after she went home, she discovered that she too had been infected. By the time she went back to the center for treatment, it was too late. They brought her straight to the area for the most serious cases. “In fact, we were together in the same place. I thought I recognized her from the patio, and I asked if it was her. A doctor told me it was and that, unfortunately, she had just passed away. I couldn’t even say goodbye,” he says. Slown explains that fear got the best of him when he went home, despite health educators having accompanied him to explain to his community that he was free of the virus and didn’t represent any danger to them. Such was the protocol at the time.

He says the workers hugged him in front of the neighbors and the officials recommended that they burn everything in his home to avoid new infections. “It took a lot for them to accept me,” he says. He remarried in 2017 to a younger woman named Jennet, a 40-year-old who is also an Ebola survivor. To earn a living, Slown grows corn and cassava leaves. He bids goodbye with a final message and a half-smile: “I’m counting on you to let people know that we still need help.”

7. Tony Henry: “We have to learn from history”

Tony Henry. The 49-year-old was cured but left home to escape stigma.

Tony Henry, now 49 years old, beat Ebola. Despite that, after being cured he had to leave his home to escape stigma. The father of four children, he was for a time vice-president of a network of Ebola survivors that had 1,668 members. When asked, he’s not shy about his hopes for the future. He wants to build a monument in memory of the victims of the virus, but the Liberian government has ignored his requests, which is why he’s asked non-profits for funding. Henry is a Christian and says he was unafraid even during the worst moments of his illness, because his fate was in the hands of God. He lost his mother and wife and continues to feel pain in his legs.

“Viruses replicate, we don’t know what tomorrow will bring. We have to learn from history. The big difference is that we have a vaccine now, but I’m afraid for the new generations,” he says. The injection interrupts transmission of the virus, which can kill 50% of those it infects, and increases the survival rate for those who were infected before receiving their dose, according to MSF research. Henry points out that the impact of Covid was less severe in Liberia. “We had more experience and had already learned some protocols, like avoiding contact and wearing masks.”

Paynesville City, Tony Henry’s neighborhood in a peripheral community of Monrovia, capital of Liberia.

Henry stays in contact with the world through an aging mobile phone. The latest news he read was about the fires in Southern California. He calls Liberia a peaceful country. “It’s easy to live here if you have money, it’s all about having work,” he says.

8. Theophilius Fayieh: “We have to help pay for the education of Ebola orphans”

After beating Ebola, Theophilius Fayieh provided psychological support to others who have been affected.

First it was his friend. Theophilius Fayieh knew it was Ebola, because the man threw up on himself. After accompanying him to the isolation center, Fayieh began to experience his own symptoms. First, he went to the government clinic, where they told him that he was fine. But he knew he was sick. When he arrived on foot to his home, he had a fever of nearly 107 degrees. He tells this story with boundless amounts of energy. Fayieh is an optimist. He beat Ebola, married his girlfriend and became an ambassador for a humanitarian aid organization, International Medical Corps. The immunity he’d acquired even allowed him to assist in births that took place in the center, where no one else dared to touch the placentas of women who had Ebola because they were highly contagious.

“For me, Ebola became an opportunity to work, I was at MSF for seven years,” he says. In 2015, he told his story alongside his wife in a project financed by the European Union, for which they allowed cameras to record their day-to-day lives. Fayieh is now 41 years old and the president of the National Association of Medical Assistants in Liberia. He’s gotten a master’s degree in nutrition and is preparing for a program in public health administration. “We have to help pay for the education of Ebola orphans, because in this country, if you can’t pay for school, you can’t keep going to class. We also have to create programs to fight against diseases like malaria and invest in neo-natal care and pediatrics. Since the MSF pediatric hospital closed two years ago, there’s no free, quality alternative for children. I ask the international community to help build new hospitals.”

9. Watta Jabateh: “I lost my business”

“When I caught the virus, I lost my business,” says Watta Jabateh, who came home to find that 50,000 Liberian dollars ($261) she’d saved had disappeared. This was far from the worst part of the outbreak — nine members of her family died.

Children of all ages surround Watta Jabateh on a sunny January afternoon in the central area of Monrovia. She emerges from her home barefoot, wearing a black dress. She speaks an English that is hard to understand for foreigners. “Before Ebola visited my family, I worked in an import business,” she says. She traveled to Guinea and Sierra Leone to buy clothes to bring back to Liberia to sell. “When I caught the virus, I lost my business,” she continues. She came home and the 50,000 Liberian dollars ($261) she’d saved up had disappeared.

This was far from the worst thing to befall her during that time. Nine members of her family died, and the neighbors barred her from entering the mosque for months. Like other patients, she says the pain in her eyes and legs caused by Ebola persists.

10. Benetta Coleman: “Around here, nobody knows I’m an Ebola survivor”

Benetta Coleman takes Paracetamol to treat the intense headaches she suffers after having Ebola. Being cured was supposed to mean she could start over, but things haven’t been going well.

Benetta Coleman takes Paracetamol to treat the intense headaches she suffers after having Ebola — when she can find someone to pay for the medicine. Being cured was supposed to mean she could start over, but things haven’t been going well. The 34-year-old earns just $1 a day selling water and ice in the streets of Monrovia. She cares for her eight-year-old daughter, Francia, who is her greatest treasure and whose father is a married man who tried to convince Coleman to get an abortion, and who has never wanted to help them. “They had told me that it was very probable that I wouldn’t be able to have children, so when I became pregnant, I was absolutely sure that I wanted to have my daughter,” she says.

What was it like starting over? “I had lost 15 members of my family to the virus. Soon after I was cured, Atena, an MSF worker, offered me a job. For a few months I worked at Elwa-3 as a social assistant. With the money they paid me, I bought property, but when Ebola was in its final days, MSF handed the center over to the government and I was left without a job or money to develop the land,” Coleman says. Today, she has just one sister, who helps her survive. “Around here,” she says, “no one knows I’m an Ebola survivor.”

She’s one of many patients who had to move because of stigma. Prevail covered her medical expenses for six months. Now Coleman’s main issue is money, as it is for the majority of survivors. The United Nations’ Human Development Index, which measures countries’ progress, has found that Liberians have one of the worst qualities of life in the world: 83.8% of the population lives under the poverty line, which is set at wages of $1.25 a day. “Becoming a mother after the epidemic is the best thing that has happened to me in 10 years,” she says. “My only wish is for someone to help me provide a future for my daughter. I can only put her into school when I get some money.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742646358.0,Flu in US continues to decline but still packs a punch,"US flu activity declined last week for the fifth week in a row, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today it is still seeing substantial activity, with 17 more pediatric flu deaths reported.

As the nation grappled with a high-severity season, test positivity in the first months of the year reached as high as 31.6%, but that figure is now at 13.3%. The percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness has declined to 3.9%, but **it has been above the baseline of 3% for 16 straight weeks.** Most of the state reporting high activity are roughly in the northeastern quadrant of the country.

Of viruses tested at public health labs, 93.7% were influenza A and 6.3% were influenza B. Of subtyped influenza A viruses, 57% were the 2009 H1N1 strain and 43% were H3N2.

Flu hospitalizations this season reached their highest level since the 2010-11 flu season and have been dropping since the middle of February, with declines last week seen in all US regions.

The 17 additional pediatric flu deaths reported last week push the national total to 151. Of the latest deaths, 15 were due to influenza A and 2 from influenza B, and of 10 subtyped influenza A viruses, half were H1N1 and half were H3N2. The previous two flu seasons saw 187 and 207 pediatric flu-related deaths, respectively, for the full season.

In its respiratory virus snapshot, the CDC said it expects **flu activity to last several more weeks.**

**COVID, already at low levels, continues to ebb**

The CDC said peak hospitalizations from COVID-19 in the winter respiratory virus season were lower than previous seasons and half that of last season. Deaths from COVID last week made up 1% of all deaths, with the level still trending higher this season for flu, at 1.9%.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742578530.0,"Measles cases linked to outbreak in Texas reach 309, surpassing nationwide total in 2024","The number of measles cases associated with an outbreak in western Texas has grown to 309, with 30 cases reported over the last three days, according to new data released Friday.

This means the total number of Texas cases linked to the outbreak in roughly two months has surpassed the number confirmed for the entirety of last year in the U.S., which saw 285 cases nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown. At least 40 people have been hospitalized so far, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).

Just two cases have occurred in people fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases, at 130, followed by children ages 4 and under accounting for 102 cases.

There have been two U.S. deaths linked to measles this year, with one confirmed and one under investigation.

The confirmed death was an unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas. The child did not have any known underlying conditions, according to DSHS.

The death was the first U.S. measles death recorded in a decade, according to data from the CDC.

A possible second measles death was recorded after an unvaccinated New Mexico resident tested positive for the virus following their death. The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said the official cause of death is still under investigation.

New Mexico has reported a total of 42 measles cases so far this year, according to the NMDOH. Many of the cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders western Texas. Four of the New Mexico cases occurred in people who were vaccinated with at least one MMR dose, while 30 cases were reported in unvaccinated individuals, according to the NMDOH. Eight of the cases presented in people whose vaccination status is unknown.

Health officials suspect there may be a connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases but a link has not been confirmed.

The CDC has confirmed 301 measles cases in at least 14 states so far this year as of last week, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.

The majority of nationally confirmed cases are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the CDC said. Of those cases, 3% are among those who received just one dose of the MMR inoculation and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC. [...]

The White House is searching for a replacement after the nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Florida congressman, was abruptly pulled last week.

White House officials have said internally that they are trying to ""get it right"" with their next pick, multiple administration officials said, seeking to address concerns about a prolonged vacancy at the agency or the prospect of another embarrassing about-face. Some potential contenders have also turned down offers for the role, federal health officials said. [...] 

**Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo**

As Florida's surgeon general since 2021, Dr. Joseph Ladapo has drawn controversy on a number of issues, including contradicting federal guidance on COVID vaccines and for his handling of local measles outbreaks. But he has some prominent supporters. 

Dr. David Weldon said Thursday, a week after his own nomination was pulled, that Ladapo should be at the top of President Trump's list to lead the CDC.

Weldon's backing of Dr. Joseph Ladapo comes days after Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis renewed his own support of the state's top doctor for the slot. 

""I thoroughly support Dr. Ladapo for CDC director. He should be at the top of President Trump's list. He has done a great job for us here in Florida and his education and experience make him the perfect choice,"" Weldon said in a statement to CBS News.

Ladapo's prospects to be confirmed in the Senate could be steep, given his past record rejecting the CDC and Food and Drug Administration's COVID vaccine recommendations and for telling parents at the height of a measles outbreak that they could send unvaccinated children to school.

""Whoever they pick, to get past [GOP Sen. Bill] Cassidy, it's best if they have never said anything remotely critical of the childhood vaccine program. Though 90% of parents are refusing COVID shots for their kids, 50% are refusing the flu shot, and 10% are refusing the measles,"" said Weldon. 

Weldon had previously suggested that reservations from two Republican senators — Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and the top Republican on the Senate's health committee, and Maine's Susan Collins — sank his chances for the role.

People familiar with Weldon's meetings with senators said Republicans were frustrated with his unfamiliarity with the CDC's workings and a lack of details on priorities for the agency, as well as an unwillingness to assuage concerns that he was perceived as anti-vaccine.

**Former Congressman Michael Burgess**

Another person widely seen as a leading contender for the role is former Republican Congressman Michael Burgess of Texas. Burgess, a former obstetrician and gynecologist, had led the House's doctors' caucus for years before he retired this year.

Burgess supported COVID-19 vaccines early during the pandemic, as well as urging constituents to follow the CDC's guidance, but later criticized the agency's lingering mask mandate for public transportation as ""nonsense policies.""

He praised President Trump's past efforts to withdraw from the World Health Organization and criticized a COVID-19 vaccine requirement on health care workers as ""an egregious overstep.""

Former federal health officials said Burgess had been viewed as deeply conservative but amenable to supporting some of the agency's priorities.

""We all share the goal of rebuilding the faith and trust in the CDC, because I think most of us recognize we need a well-functioning and respected CDC in order to protect the American people,"" Burgess said at a 2023 hearing. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742480604.0,‘Don’t call it zombie deer disease’: scientists warn of ‘global crisis’ as infections spread across the US,"In a scattershot pattern that now extends from coast to coast, continental US states have been announcing new hotspots of chronic wasting disease (CWD).

The contagious and always-fatal neurodegenerative disorder infects the cervid family that includes deer, elk, moose and, in higher latitudes, reindeer. There is no vaccine or treatment.

Described by scientists as a “slow-motion disaster in the making”, the infection’s presence in the wild began quietly, with a few free-ranging deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981. However, it has now reached wild and domestic game animal herds in 36 US states as well as parts of Canada, wild and domestic reindeer in Scandinavia and farmed deer and elk in South Korea.

In the media, CWD is often called “zombie deer disease” due to its symptoms, which include drooling, emaciation, disorientation, a vacant “staring” gaze and a lack of fear of people. As concerns about spillover to humans or other species grow, however, the moniker has irritated many scientists.

“It trivialises what we’re facing,” says epidemiologist Michael Osterholm. “It leaves readers with the false impression that this is nothing more than some strange fictional menace you’d find in the plot of a sci-fi film. Animals that get infected with CWD do not come back from the dead. CWD is a deathly serious public and wildlife health issue.”

Five years ago, Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, delivered what he hoped would be a wake-up call before the Minnesota legislature, warning about “spillover” of CWD transmission from infected deer to humans eating game meat. Back then, some portrayed him as a scaremonger.

Today, as CWD spreads inexorably to more deer and elk, more people – probably tens of thousands each year – are consuming infected venison, and a growing number of scientists are echoing Osterholm’s concerns.

In January 2025, researchers published a report, Chronic Wasting Disease Spillover Preparedness and Response: Charting an Uncertain Future. A panel of 67 experts who study zoonotic diseases that can move back and forth between humans and animals concluded that spillover to humans “would trigger a national and global crisis” with “far-reaching effects on the food supply, economy, global trade and agriculture”, as well as potentially devastating effects on human health. The report concludes that the US is utterly unprepared to deal with spillover of CWD to people, and that there is no unifying international strategy to prevent CWD’s spread.

So far, there has not been a documented case of a human contracting CWD, but as with BSE (or mad cow disease) and its variant strain that killed people, long incubation times can mask the presence of disease. CWD, which is incurable, can be diagnosed only after a victim dies. Better surveillance to identify disease in people and game animals is more urgent than ever, experts say. Osterholm says the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to public health funding and research, and the US’s withdrawal from international institutions, such as the World Health Organization, could not be happening at a worse time.

The risk of a CWD spillover event is growing, the panel of experts say, and the risk is higher in states where big game hunting for the table remains a tradition. In a survey of US residents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 20% said they had hunted deer or elk, and more than 60% said they had eaten venison or elk meat.

Tens of thousands of people are probably eating contaminated game meat either because they do not think they are at risk or they are unaware of the threat. “Hunters sharing their venison with other families is a widespread practice,” Osterholm says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who suspect they have killed an animal infected with CWD not to eat it, and states advise any hunters taking animals from infected regions to get them tested. Many, however, do not.

The movement of meat around the country also raises concerns of environmental contamination. CWD is not caused by bacteria or a virus, but by “prions”: abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that are difficult to destroy. Prions have demonstrated an ability to remain activated in soils for many years, infecting animals that come in contact with contaminated areas where they have been shed via urination, defecation, saliva and decomposition when an animal dies. Analysis by the US Geological Survey has shown that numerous carcasses of hunted animals, many probably contaminated with CWD, are transported across state lines, accelerating the scope of prion dispersal.

In states where many thousands of deer and elk carcasses are disposed of, some in landfill, there is concern among epidemiologists and local public health officials that toxic waste sites for prions could be created.

Every autumn, Lloyd Dorsey has hunted elk and deer to put meat on the table, but now he is concerned about its safety. “Since CWD is now in elk and deer throughout Greater Yellowstone, the disease is on everybody’s mind,” he says. Dorsey has spent decades as a professional conservationist for the Sierra Club, based in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, and he has pressed the state and federal governments to shut down feedgrounds for deer – where cervids gather and disease can easily spread.

Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding,” he says. [...] 

Wyoming has attracted national criticism for refusing to shutter nearly two dozen feedgrounds where tens of thousands of elk and deer gather in close confines every winter and are fed artificial forage to bolster their numbers.

One of the largest feedgrounds is operated by the federal government: the National Elk Refuge, where more than 8,000 elk cluster, and CWD has already been detected. Tom Roffe, former chief of animal health for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, and Bruce Smith, a former refuge senior biologist, have said Wyoming has created ripe conditions for an outbreak of the disease, with consequences that will negatively ripple throughout the region.

“This has been a slowly expanding epidemic with a growth curve playing out on a decades scale, but now we’re seeing the deepening consequences and they could be severe,” Roffe says. “Unfortunately, what’s happening with this disease was predictable and we’re living with the consequences of some decisions that were rooted in denial.”

Roffe and others say the best defence is having healthy landscapes where unnatural feeding of wildlife is unnecessary and where predators are not eliminated but allowed to carry out their role of eliminating sick animals.

“As Yellowstone has been for generations, it is the most amazing and best place to get wildlife conservation right,” Dorsey says. “It would be such a shame if we continued doing something as foolish as concentrating thousands of elk and deer, making them more vulnerable to catching and spreading this catastrophic disease, when we didn’t have to.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742481512.0,How the anti-vaccine movement weaponized a 6-year-old's measles death,"In February, a 6-year-old Texan was the first child in the United States to die of measles in two decades. 

Her death might have been a warning to an increasingly vaccine-hesitant country about the consequences of shunning the only guaranteed way to fight the preventable disease. 

Instead, the anti-vaccine movement is broadcasting a different lesson, turning the girl and her family into propaganda, an emotional plank in the misguided argument that vaccines are more dangerous than the illnesses they prevent. 

The child’s grieving parents have given just one on-camera interview, to Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded and led until recently by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary. In a video that aired online Monday, the young parents stifled sobs, recalling how their unvaccinated daughter got sick from measles, then pneumonia, how she was hospitalized and put on a ventilator, and how she died. 

The couple, who are Mennonites, believe their daughter’s death was the will of God. When Children’s Health Defense’s director of programming, Polly Tommey, asked specifically about parents who heard their story and might be “rushing out, panicking,” to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the parents rebuked the intervention that offered the best chance of preventing their daughter’s death.  

“Don’t do the shots,” the girl’s mother said. Measles, she added, is “not as bad as they’re making it out to be.” She noted that her four other children all recovered after having received alternative treatments from an anti-vaccine doctor, including cod liver oil, a source of vitamin A, and budesonide, an inhaled steroid usually used for asthma.  

“Also, the measles are good for the body,” the girl’s father said, adding through an interpreter of Low German that measles boosts the immune system and wards against cancer — an untrue supposition often offered by anti-vaccine groups and repeated recently by Kennedy. 

Without evidence, influencers at Children’s Health Defense and beyond have reframed the tragedy of the girl’s death as proof — of the efficacy of unproven cures like vitamin A, of maltreatment by a hospital and even of a plot to undermine Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services.

It’s a familiar playbook, following countless videos Children’s Health Defense has produced before this one. Along with since-discredited science, the modern anti-vaccine movement was built on the personal accounts of parents — collected through websites, bus tours and anti-vaccine documentaries — who claimed vaccines harmed their children.  

And even as experts point to overwhelming data on vaccine safety, the raw and immediate accounts — delivered straight to the movement’s followers — provide a narrative that public health officials, bound by evidence and constrained by institutional caution, struggle to counter. 

“It was a savvy way of centering a mother’s intuition, a mother’s insight, which is very sacred in our culture,” said Karen Ernst, director of the nonprofit group Voices for Vaccines. “That was paramount to how they built the movement.”  

“The problem is, a simple story told quickly is so much easier to believe than a nuanced, well-sourced truth told later,” Ernst added. “In that way, public health is always chasing the anti-vaccine movement around. They’re never getting ahead of it.”

A representative for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Children’s Health Defense and Covenant Children’s Hospital also did not respond.  

HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard responded with a link to a recent op-ed on the Fox News website, in which Kennedy wrote, “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.” [...] 

In Gaines County, hundreds of parents have lined up for a makeshift warehouse clinic run by Dr. Ben Edwards, an alternative practitioner from Lubbock who treats children with an unproven protocol of cod liver oil and budesonide. 

Edwards had not treated the 6-year-old who died, but afterward, he treated the couple’s remaining children at their sibling’s wake.  

“Dr. Edwards was there for us,” the mother said. 

Edwards did not respond to a request for comment.  

Despite the urgency of the measles crisis, the official response from medical groups has been typically restrained. In a statement Tuesday, a coalition of 34 scientific and medical organizations, including the American Association of Immunologists, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, reiterated their support for vaccines as “a cornerstone of public health, a shining example of the power of scientific research, and a vital tool in the fight against preventable diseases.” 

In a media landscape in which misinformation spreads faster than institutional statements, it’s unlikely to be enough. 

“We can provide information to other people and just say this is what the data show, but it might take some people with high charisma to help deliver those messages,” said Stephen Jameson, president of the American Association of Immunologists. “But it is hard, because if a vaccine is preventative, where is the rescue of somebody? How do you tell the story ‘Child does not get disease’?” 

In this environment, Kennedy plays a key public role at the helm of HHS, a platform he has already used to spread falsehoods about measles, the MMR vaccine and the outbreak in Texas.

“Misinformation is really leading the day,” said Kris Ehresmann, the recently retired director of the Minnesota Health Department’s infectious disease division. “It’s gone from a parent trying to assess the best decision for their child to a hostile movement that I didn’t see in the early days of my career.” 

“Covid politicized vaccines and science, really,” Ehresmann added. “And that gave the anti-vaxxer folks a huge foothold.” 

Patsy Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner, has seen how the uncontrolled spread of an illness can change parents’ minds — with the right messaging. She recalls going “mosque to mosque to mosque” during a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota to listen to the Somali community’s concerns and educate local religious leaders about the danger of measles and the safety of the MMR vaccine.

She spoke to nearly every parent of the children hospitalized in the outbreak. “Many of them, the parents, were like, ‘Oh, my God, I never knew it would be this bad. Why didn’t I know this?’” said Stinchfield, who later served as president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The No. 1 thing I heard was regret — like, ‘Why didn’t I vaccinate?’”  

Those stories have yet to be publicly shared by parents of children sickened in the West Texas outbreak.  

Last week, anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree dedicated a segment of his internet show, “The HighWire,” to interviewing Texas mothers whose unvaccinated children contracted and survived measles. As the parents described standing by their choice not to vaccinate, photos of one child, who had to be medevaced to a Lubbock hospital, filled the screen. The girl was lying in a hospital bed, her eyes glazed, connected to lines and tubes. 

After years of arguing measles was no threat to healthy U.S. children, Bigtree was visibly taken aback and searched for an explanation — perhaps measles had mutated to become more serious, he suggested. 

“That little girl is very sick,” he said.

In another update, the CDC said its scientists have completed serology testing on blood samples from close contacts of a San Fransico child whose mild illness from an undetermined source was first announced in February.

The child’s blood had antibodies to H5N1, but testing on samples from the child’s close contacts were negative for previous infection with the virus, suggesting that none of them were infected.

“These findings are reassuring,” the CDC said, noting that so far, no human-to-human H5N1 transmission has been detected in the United States.

In its report, the CDC also spotlighted two recently published ferret studies that found pre-existing antibodies from earlier infection with the 2009 H1N1 seasonal flu virus might provide some protection against H5N1. One of the two studies, published this week in The Lancet Microbe, also found that the ferrets with previous exposure to H1N1 were less likely to pass the virus to animals in the same enclosure. 

The same study also found that ferrets with ocular exposure to the B3.13 genotype H5N1 virus developed severe and transmissible disease, similar to when they were infected by the respiratory route, which the CDC said supports the recommendation for wearing eye protection when exposed to infected or potentially infected animals.

**USDA announces funding for poultry avian flu measures**

In other H5N1 developments, the USDA today  announced up to $100 million in funding for projects to battle avian flu in poultry and reduce the price of eggs.

The three priority areas are novel therapeutics and improved diagnostics, research to better understand how the virus is introduced into poultry flocks and to inform biosecurity mitigation steps, and novel vaccines.

The agency said it consulted with other federal health agencies in setting the funding opportunities. The USDA emphasized that no vaccines are currently authorized and that any decision to move forward with use will involve input from federal agencies, states, veterinarians, farmers, the public health system, and the American public.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742440807.0,"Canada: Increase in Alberta measles cases ‘only the beginning,’ health advocates worry","With the number of measles cases in Alberta on the rise, there are growing calls for the provincial government to do more to help stop the spread.


As of 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the provincial government’s online measles tracker lists 13 confirmed cases of the virus in Alberta — that’s two more cases than there was on Monday — with one more case in the Calgary area and another in Edmonton.

Eight of the cases listed are in the northern part of province, where the vaccination rate is the lowest in Alberta. [...] 

On Tuesday, Alberta Health Services and the Calgary Board of Education sent a letter to parents, staff and volunteers warning them about the virus, its symptoms and information about the measles vaccine.

The letter also warns about the possibility of serious complications for people who contract the virus, including “ear infections, pneumonia, seizures, or inflammation of the brain” and it warns  “complications are more common among children under five years and people who are pregnant or immunocompromised.”

David Brewerton, pharmacy manager at Luke’s Drug Mart in Calgary, said **the low vaccination rate in Alberta — 81.7 per cent — is a problem “because measles is extremely contagious.  So much so that you need to be over 95 per cent vaccinated in the population in order to be considered to have herd immunity.”** [...] 

Glen Anderson, who spoke to Global News outside Lukes Drug Mart, said he’s flabbergasted over the recent increase in measles cases.

“It’s kind of stunning to me that people would ignore something so important like this (that) was pretty much eradicated. You know, 10 or 15 years ago, we’d never heard of measles anymore. None of my kids ever had issues with it,” said Anderson.

Friends of Medicare is calling on the Alberta government to come up with a comprehensive “action plan” to educate people about the dangers of measels and the importance of getting vaccinated.

The increase in measles cases in Alberta has also prompted a warning from Friends of Medicare that this may be “only the beginning.”

It is calling on the provincial government to come up with an action plan to prevent the spread, including “widespread public education about the disease as well as a public health campaign on the importance of being vaccinated.”

In a media release sent out Wednesday morning, Chris Gallaway, executive director of Friends of Medicare, calls measles “a horrible and totally preventable disease.

He also took aim at the governing United Conservative Party, saying “a concerning disregard for the importance of vaccines appears to have become par for the course with our current government.”

In response to an inquiry from Global News about the possibility of trying to boost immunization numbers, a spokesperson for the Health Minister’s office provided a written response that said “unfortunately, measles cases are increasing globally and across Canada, including here in Alberta.”

The statement adds that “Alberta’s government is monitoring the situation very closely alongside our public health team, while also providing resources and regular updates at Alberta.ca/measles to ensure Albertans have the information they need.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742343054.0,Texas public health official predicts the measles outbreak could take a year to contain,"The expanding measles outbreak that has spread from West Texas into New Mexico and Oklahoma could take a year to contain, a public health leader in the area where the outbreak started warned on Tuesday.

Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, said the outbreak is still growing, with capacity to transmit both locally and further afield through spread to pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Though the response teams have been stressing the importance of vaccination, uptake of vaccines “has definitely been a struggle,” Wells said. 

“This is going to be a large outbreak. And we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” Wells said during a press conference organized by the Big Cities Health Coalition, a forum for leaders of metropolitan health departments. 

“I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long in order to get through this entire outbreak,” she said. [...] 

“I just think that it being so rural, now multi-state, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work, to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population,” Wells said.

Though efforts to increase vaccination rates among the most affected communities are not meeting with substantial success, Wells said in Lubbock about 300 more doses than normally would be administered have been given in the past couple of weeks.

Mixed messaging about the best way to combat measles could be contributing to the difficulties in bringing the outbreak to a close, suggested Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. 

Neither Huang nor the other public health officials at the press conference referenced Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. directly in their remarks. And at a point, Huang sidestepped a question about whether Kennedy — a long-time critic of vaccines, particularly the measles, mumps and rubella shot — was undermining the effort to persuade parents of unvaccinated children to get them vaccinated. [...] 

“One of the things that we really depend on … is a consistent message, really, from all levels,” Huang said. “All of us, from the highest level down to the ground level need to be reinforcing that message about the importance of vaccines and that vaccines are the way we prevent this and are going to address this, and need to address this.”

“And we do have some concerns when some other messages might dilute that message.”
Simbo Ige, Chicago’s commissioner of public health, spoke of the struggles her department faced last year during a large measles outbreak that began in a migrant shelter in the city. Over the course of the outbreak, 30,000 doses of vaccine were administered, she noted.

“Vitamin A was not the reason why we got to [measles] elimination. It was the vaccination,” Ige said.

OSDH reported the state’s first probable measles cases March 11. An OSDH spokesperson told StateImpact at the time the agency wasn’t releasing the geographic details of these cases because they “don’t pose a public health risk and to protect patient privacy.”

All four cases occurred among unvaccinated individuals and were associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreak, which has so far infected nearly 300 people.

OSDH said in a press release it “immediately began its investigation” upon receiving notification of the two new cases March 14. It said their initial exposure was not from the two cases announced March 11.

The virus can linger in the air for about two hours after an infected individual has left the room. Potential measles exposure locations include:

Kohl's, 12405 E. 96th St. N., Owasso: 1:30 - 5:30 p.m., Feb. 27 
Aldi, 9259 N. Owasso Expressway, Owasso: 4:20 - 7 p.m., Feb. 27

Lowe's Home Improvement, 1746 S. Lynn Riggs Blvd., Claremore: 7 - 9:27 p.m., March 2

OSDH said in the release if an individual visited these locations during the dates and timeframes identified and is unvaccinated, unsure of their vaccine or immune status, or has concerns, they are encouraged to provide their name and contact information on this form. Someone from OSDH or the Tulsa Health Department will contact them for further information and guidance.

“Possibly exposed individuals who are not immune through vaccination or prior infection should exclude themselves from public settings for 21 days from the date of their potential exposure,” the release read.

In a previous press release, OSDH defined a probable measles case as one that shows symptoms consistent with the national standard surveillance definition and lacks a confirmatory test result or a link to a laboratory-confirmed case. [...] 

The spokesperson said because the cases are probable, they will not be publicly listed on the CDC’s website because the agency only displays confirmed measles case counts.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742299953.0,Novel Rodent Coronavirus-like Virus Detected Among Beef Cattle with Respiratory Disease in Mexico,"Not quite a year ago, on March 24th 2024, we looked into Curious Reports of Unknown Disease In Dairy Cows (Texas, Kansas & New Mexico).  Reports that the following day would be confirmed as being HPAI H5 (see USDA Statement on HPAI In Dairy Cattle in Texas & Kansas Herds).

>Prior to this point, while cattle had been experimentally infected in the lab, they were thought poorly susceptible to influenza A viruses (see A Brief History Of Influenza A In Cattle/Ruminants).  Cattle, however, are susceptible to influenza D viruses.

Although originally believed to be a geographically limited spillover with limited impact, today we know nearly 1,000 herds across 17 states have been infected (an undercount), and that at least 41 humans have been infected via exposure to infected cattle, along with a large number of peridomestic mammals.

While it is too soon to know how much of an impact it may have, a year later we have a eerily similar report - this time on a novel coronavirus - detected among beef cattle in Monterrey, Mexico. 

Coronaviruses are divided into 4 distinct genera; Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses, and Deltacoronaviruses - and while both birds and mammals are susceptible to coronavirus infection - they each (at least, for the most part) stay in their own lane. 

Birds are primarily infected by gammacoronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) and occasionally by deltacoronaviruses, while mammals are primarily affected by alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. 

But there are a few crossovers - particularly with Deltacoronaviruses - which have been detected mostly in birds and but occasionally in mammals (see Discovery of seven novel Mammalian and avian coronaviruses in the genus deltacoronavirus . . . . ).  

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), first identified in 2012, is one of those DCoV outliers we keep an eye on (see PNAS: Broad Receptor Engagement of PDCoV May Potentiate Its Cross-Species Transmissibility) due to its feared zoonotic potential (see also ​New pig virus found to be a potential threat to humans). 

Which is why, when dealing with viruses, one never likes to say `never'.  

Cattle are highly susceptible to a Bovine coronavirus (BCov) - a betacoronavirus -  which causes both respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases (see Frontiers Bovine Coronavirus and the Associated Diseases), which was first isolated by the University of Nebraska in 1972.    

But the coronavirus described in the following report is an alphacoronavirus - and while the entire genome has not been sequenced - it most closely resembles a rodent-coronavirus isolated in China in 2021 (see AFD blog Nature: Virus Diversity, Wildlife-Domestic Animal Circulation and Potential Zoonotic Viruses of Small Mammals, Pangolins and Zoo Animals). [...] [Link to Study](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/17/3/433) 

While we grudgingly accept that zoonotic influenza pandemics may occur several times a century, there seems to be a widespread belief that our SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was somehow a rare - one off - event, that is unlikely to be repeated.

This despite two other `close calls' with `COVID-like' epidemics in the past 23 years (SARS & MERS), and the fact that new emerging coronavirus threats continue to be discovered (see J. Med. Virology: Potential Cross-Species Transmission Risks of Emerging Swine Enteric Coronavirus to Human Beings).

The reality is that coronaviruses are highly mutable, and have the potential to recombine into new variants, which raises concerns over the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 along with MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses (see Nature: CoV Recombination Potential & The Need For the Development of Pan-CoV Vaccines). [...] 

While we've been primarily focused on avian H5 viruses this year, this is a reminder than Nature's laboratory is not only open 24/7, it is fully capable of running multiple GOF (Gain of Function) field experiments concurrently.

We now live in an age (see The Third Epidemiological Transition) where the the number, frequency, and intensity of pandemics are only expected to increase over the next few decades.

While we can debate when - or from what - another pandemic is inevitable. All we can really control is how well prepared we are, when the inevitable happens.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742236067.0,New bat coronavirus discovered in Brazil – but risks are unclear,"A new coronavirus discovered in bats in Brazil has been found to share similarities with the deadly Mers virus but its risk to humans remains unclear, scientists say.

Researchers from São Paulo and Ceará discovered the novel coronavirus in collaboration with colleagues from Hong Kong University (HKU), and found it resembles the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (Mers-CoV).

The Mers virus was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has since led to over 850 deaths with cases of infection reported across more than two dozen countries.

The new coronavirus discovered in Brazil has a genetic sequence with about 72 per cent similarity to the Mers-CoV genome, scientists say.

Specifically, the spike protein of the new virus, which it uses to attach to host cells, shows 71.74 per cent similarity with the Mers virus spike protein, they say.

“Right now we aren’t sure it can infect humans, but we detected parts of the virus’s spike protein [which binds to mammalian cells to start an infection] suggesting potential interaction with the receptor used by Mers-CoV,” said study first author and PhD candidate Bruna Stefanie Silvério.

Scientists hope to conduct further experiments in Hong Kong this year at high-biosecurity laboratories to determine the risks posed by the new virus to humans.

“This monitoring helps identify circulating viruses and risks of transmission to other animals, and even to humans,” said Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, another author of the study.

In the latest study, published in the Journal of Medical Virology (JMV), scientists screened 423 oral and rectal swabs from 16 different bat species.

Researchers identified seven coronaviruses in five out of 16 oral and rectal swabs from bats collected in the city of Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil.

They found that the new virus has “high similarities” to Mers-related coronavirus strains found in humans and camels.

Scientists also spotted evidence of the virus genome mixing and changing in a process known as recombination.

The findings highlight the “extensive genetic diversity” of coronaviruses, the presence of their novel lineages, and the occurrence of recombination events among bat viruses circulating in Brazil, researchers say.

“Bats are important viral reservoirs and should therefore be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance,” Dr Durães-Carvalho said.

The new study, according to scientists, underscores the critical role bats play as reservoirs for emerging viruses and emphasises the necessity of ongoing surveillance to monitor the public health risks associated with coronaviruses.

“Our studies show the importance of making this type of analysis more systematic, optimised and integrated, with several sectors participating and generating data on unified platforms that can be used by health systems to monitor and even prevent epidemics and pandemics,” he concluded.",1jdjv9d,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/bat-coronavirus-brazil-human-infection-risk-b2716310.html,464
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742232004.0,"As bird flu continues to spread, Trump administration sidelines key pandemic preparedness office","The Trump administration has not staffed an office established by Congress to prepare the nation for future pandemics, according to three sources familiar with the situation.

The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy was established by Congress in 2022 in response to mistakes that led to a flat-footed response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The office, called OPPR, once had a staff of about 20 people and was orchestrating the country’s response to bird flu and other threats until January 20, including hosting regular interagency meetings to share plans.

“We did it very much behind the scenes,” said Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a physician and retired Air Force major general who was director of OPPR during the Biden administration.

As of this this week, only one staffer will remain, and it’s unclear who that person reports to, according to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. OPPR’s pages have also been removed from the White House website.

The new administration has not halted the country’s response to bird flu completely, but recent agency announcements and interviews with government sources show its focus has changed. For example, a leading goal of the response now is to bring down egg prices, rather than tackling the spread of the virus or preparing for a worst-case scenario in which the virus mutates and spreads easily from person to person.

OPPR exists “in name only,” said a source familiar with the status of the office who worked inside the White House during the last administration. “It has fallen into the abyss.” [...]

During the first few weeks of the administration, the White House quietly hired Dr. Gerald Parker, a veterinarian with a long history of government service and expertise in zoonotic diseases, or infections that can be transmitted from animals to people. His appointment was never formally announced but was reported in the media. Infectious disease experts praised the move to bring him into the administration.

Parker’s title is senior director for biosecurity and pandemic response. He sits on the National Security Council and has been attending meetings on bird flu, a source said.

The White House press office did not respond to a request to interview Parker and did not answer questions about Parker’s role or title, or whether his office has a budget or staff.

Friedrichs said he has not been able to meet with Parker since he was appointment and never had an opportunity to hand off OPPR’s work to him. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742223196.0,"Norovirus, Covid-19 variant, measles, WV food dye ban, and USDA Local Food cuts","Happy Saint Patrick's Day! Here’s the public health news you can use to start your week. Some virus stuff, but also a lot happening in the nutrition world.

**Your national disease report: Flu is out, norovirus is (still) in**

Influenza-like illness (e.g., fever, cough, runny nose) remains moderate across most of the U.S., but trends are sharply declining. If this continues, we could be out of respiratory virus season in a few weeks. The Northeast is still seeing high levels.

Covid-19 spread continues to decrease after a lackluster winter. But eyes are on a highly mutated variant in South Africa—called BA.3.2—which has 50 new spike mutations. This is a lot of changes in one variant. We haven’t seen this many since the Omicron tsunami in 2021.

The number of spike changes doesn’t necessarily mean it will be easily spread among humans, so we must pay attention to other metrics. According to wastewater trends in South Africa, transmission is increasing, which suggests the variant is something to pay attention to. We have not detected it in other countries yet. Will this fizzle out, drive a summer wave, or become a tsunami? Time will tell.

Norovirus—think diarrhea and vomiting—is having. a. year. Test positivity rates remain nearly double last year’s. The virus mutates slightly every few years, triggering a surge—and we’re in one now. Fortunately, norovirus season is typically November–April, so I’m hopeful this will be winding down soon.

**What does this mean to you?** Sickness in your family should slow down soon, as respiratory season is in the rearview mirror. If you have the stomach bug, use a separate bathroom in your house and wear a mask if possible. Hand sanitizer doesn’t kill this bugger, either—soap and water are your best bet.

**Measles Situation Report**

As of Friday, the U.S. has reported 326 measles cases—more than the annual total in 12 of the past 15 years, and it’s only March.

Measles cases surge every five years for reasons we don’t fully understand. Pair that with declining vaccination rates in the U.S. and worldwide, and you get the perfect storm. Last year, Europe saw its highest measles case count in 25 years.

In the Texas/New Mexico outbreak, measles cases continue to climb—and estimates suggest the true count could be 4 times higher than reported. The outbreak is spreading beyond the Panhandle to East Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, and possibly Kansas. The vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated, school-aged children.

Measles is increasing beyond this outbreak and is linked to international travel. In the past week, cases have popped up in Vermont, Michigan, New York, Houston, California, and Pennsylvania.

**What does this mean to you?** Check your vaccination status. If you’re up-to-date on vaccines, you’re very well-protected against measles. People around you may start having more questions about vaccines, though, given confusing statements from HHS. The best thing you can do is listen from a place of empathy and point them to evidence-based information or a trusted messenger, like a clinician (or YLE :)).

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742147992.0,Newborn babies exposed to measles in Texas hospital,"On Wednesday, a woman gave birth in a Lubbock, Texas, hospital in the middle of a deadly and fast-growing measles outbreak. Doctors didn’t realize until the young mother had been admitted and in labor that she was infected with the measles.

By that time, other new moms, newborn babies and their families at University Medical Center Children’s Hospital in Lubbock had unknowingly been exposed to the virus, considered one of the most contagious in the world. 

Hospital staff are scrambling with damage control efforts — implementing emergency masking policies and giving babies as young as three days old injections of immunoglobulin, an antibody that helps their fragile immune system fight off infections.

A 2021 study found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.

“These babies didn’t ask for this exposure,” said Chad Curry, training chief for the University Medical Center EMS. “But at the end of the day, this is the only way we can protect them.”

Neither Curry nor UMC representatives could give an exact number of exposed newborns.

It’s unclear when the woman tested positive for measles. Public health officials are casting a wide net in an effort to contact everyone who may have been exposed to this particular patient. Viral particles can live in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours.

It’s a setback for public health officials on the front lines trying to stop the escalating outbreak.

At the end of last week, Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock’s health department, said she felt like the outbreak was beginning to be controlled. At the time, cases seemed to have peaked. Doctors offices had become savvy at making sure patients likely to have a measles exposure steered clear of other patients.

This new development, she said in an interview Friday, “feels like we’re back to square one.” [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742060060.0,"Keeping With Kennedy’s Advice, Measles Patients Turn to Unproven Treatments","[...] “I’m worried we have kids and parents that are taking all of these other medications and then delaying care,” said Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, where many of the sickest children in this outbreak have been hospitalized.

Some seriously ill children had been given alternative remedies like cod liver oil, she added. “If they’re so, so sick and have low oxygen levels, they should have been in the hospital a day or two earlier,” she said. [...] 

In the last few weeks, drugstores in West Texas have struggled to keep bottles of vitamin A pills and cod liver oil supplements on their shelves.

And this week, doctors at Seminole Memorial Hospital, which sits at the center of Gaines County, noticed that the number of patients coming in for measles symptoms suddenly dropped. Those who did show up were sicker than patients seen in previous weeks.

Even while cases in the community increased, Dr. Leila Myrick, a physician at the hospital, said she performed half the number of measles tests, compared with those the week before.

She worried that her patients were instead going less than a mile away from the hospital to a pop-up clinic, where a doctor from a neighboring city had been doling out alternative remedies, like cod liver oil and vitamin C.

The physician, Dr. Ben Edwards, is well known in the area for producing podcasts that often discuss the dangers of vaccines, and for his wellness clinic in Lubbock, which rejects central tenets of medicine, like the idea that germs cause certain diseases.

In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Kennedy said he had spoken with Dr. Edwards (whom he mistakenly called Dr. Ed Benjamin) and learned “what is working on the ground.”

In an email relayed through an employee, Dr. Edwards confirmed that he had talked to Mr. Kennedy for about 15 minutes in what he described as an “information gathering” phone call. Dr. Edwards declined to speak directly with The New York Times.

In the following days, hundreds of people from the Mennonite community lined up at Dr. Edwards’s makeshift clinic, held behind a local health food store, said Tina Siemens, who helped organize the event.

Mrs. Siemens said people seeking treatment for active measles infections and those who hoped to prevent one were in attendance.

To get enough supplements for the clinic, Dr. Edwards had enlisted one of his patients, a pilot, to fly to Scottsdale, Ariz., and pick up nearly a thousand bottles of vitamin C supplements and cod liver oil, both as a lemon-flavored drink and unflavored soft gels, said an owner of the supplement company, Patrick Sullivan.

“How much do you have in stock, and how quickly could you get it to me?” Mr. Sullivan recalled Dr. Edwards asking.

The treatments were free, Mrs. Siemens said. Members of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit that Mr. Kennedy helped found before becoming health secretary, created a donation page online that has raised more than $16,000 to help cover the cost of “essential vitamins, supplements and medicines.”

Measles symptoms often resolve on their own within a few weeks. But in rare cases, the virus can cause pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, especially children, to get oxygen into their lungs. There could also be brain swelling, which can cause lasting problems, like blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. Both complications can be deadly. [...] 

Unproven remedies have for decades made measles outbreaks more deadly, said Patsy Stinchfield, immediate past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

She worked as a nurse practitioner at a hospital in Minnesota during a measles outbreak in 1989 that killed several children. Two of them arrived at her hospital in critical condition after their parents had tended to them at home with traditional healing therapies.

“They keep their child at home too long, and they try these home remedies,” she said. “They went straight from the E.R. into the intensive care unit and they died.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1742042731.0,Bird flu mutation associated with increased disease severity found in two cats,"A genetic mutation of the H5N1 bird flu virus — a mutation associated with increased infectiousness and disease severity — has been found in two cats, in what scientists say is another indication of the risks posed by the virus.

The fact that the cats have the mutation “is a continued example of how this virus is evolving in nature and should concern everyone,” said Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist at Emory University in Atlanta.

Henry Niman, founder of vaccine research firm Recombinomics Inc., reviewed the sequence data and reported the results to The Times.
The gene that Niman identified in the sequence data, known as PB2 E627K, has been associated with increased mammal-to-mammal transmission and disease severity in laboratory animals.

It is a similar mutation to the one found in San Bernardino dairy cows earlier this week, but has a slightly different origin. The cows were infected with the B3.13 strain of H5N1 — which has been circulating widely in dairy cows since last March. The cats were infected with the newer D1.1 strain, which is widespread in wild birds — and has also now appeared in a few cattle herds in Nevada and Arizona.

Niman said he believed the two cats were based in New Jersey and infected last month based on the scientific nomenclature used to label the genetic sequences.

The New Jersey Department of Public Health and Raritan Township, which reported a cluster of infected cats last month in Hunterdon County, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Since the beginning of 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 51 H5N1-infected cats. They include both household pets and feral felines, and have been found in 13 states since the beginning of the year, including California, Montana, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and New Jersey. There have been more than 100 reported since last March, when the outbreak was first reported in dairy cows.

According to the New Jersey Department of Public Health, the infected cats all lived on the same property. One was feral, another was an indoor/outdoor cat. The living situation of the remaining four cats is unclear.

On Thursday, the genetic sequences of H5N1 virus taken from two infected cats were added to GISAID — the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data — a publicly-accessible gene data bank.

Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert at St. Jude’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said the discovery of the mutation wasn’t alarming in and of itself.

“This mutation has sporadically popped up in other mammal infections over the past few years,” he said. “It’s an easy change for the H5 viruses to make and it does so relatively frequently.”
It’ll become concerning, he said, if it spreads more widely.

There have been no reports of infected humans in New Jersey, and a press release from the state said the people who interacted with the infected cats were asymptomatic.

That Feb. 28 release said that the infected cats had no known reported exposures to infected poultry, livestock, or consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk or meat, “but did roam freely outdoors, so exposure to wild birds or other animals is unknown.”

Since the outbreak started last March, 70 people in the U.S. have been infected with H5N1; one person has died.

The outbreak of the highly contagious virus, which began in late January and is centered in the western part of the state, **now stands at 259 cases, according to the latest update from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).** Of those patients, 257 are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and 201 are children ages 17 or younger. Thirty-four patients have been hospitalized, with one death in an unvaccinated child who had no known underlying conditions.

Eleven counties to date have reported cases, but two thirds of the cases (174; 67%) are in Gaines County, which has one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one vaccine. The county is home to a large Mennonite community with low vaccination rates.

DSHS officials said they have determined that three of the case-patients previously listed as vaccinated were not vaccinated. Two had received their measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine doses 1 to 2 days before their symptoms started and after they had been exposed to the virus. The third had a vaccine reaction that mimicked a measles infection and has been removed from the case count.

In New Mexico, meanwhile, the case count in that state's outbreak has grown by two and now stands at 35. Of those patients, 33 are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccine status. Thirty-three of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas, and 2 are in neighboring Eddy County.

Officials in both states say additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreaks because of the highly contagious nature of the disease and are urging people to get vaccinated. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles.

**More than 300 cases nationwide**

Nationwide, a total of 301 measles cases have been reported by 15 jurisdictions, according to an update today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 285 cases were reported in all of 2024.

Fifty of the case-patients (17%) have been hospitalized, and two measles-related deaths have been reported for the year.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741979592.0,"Ebola-infected monkeys cured with a pill, raising hopes for humans: study","WASHINGTON — Monkeys infected with Ebola can be cured with a pill, according to a new study out Friday that could pave the way for more practical, affordable treatments in humans.

First identified in 1976 and thought to have crossed over from bats, Ebola is a deadly viral disease spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, causing severe bleeding and organ failure.

Because outbreaks primarily affect sub-Saharan Africa, pharmaceutical companies have lacked financial incentives to develop treatments, and the sporadic nature of outbreaks has made clinical trials difficult.

A vaccine was only widely approved in 2019, and while two intravenous antibody treatments improve outcomes, they require costly cold storage and are difficult to administer in some of the world’s poorest regions.

“We’re really trying to come up with something that was more practical, easier to use, that could be used to help prevent, control, and contain outbreaks,” Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who led the new study published in Science Advances, told AFP.

For their experiment, Geisbert and colleagues tested the antiviral Obeldesivir, the oral form of intravenous Remdesivir, originally developed for COVID-19.

Obeldesivir is a “polymerase inhibitor,” meaning it blocks an enzyme crucial for viral replication.

The team infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a high dose of the Makona variant of the Ebola virus.

A day after exposure, ten monkeys then received an Obeldesivir pill daily for ten days, while three control monkeys received no treatment and died.

Obeldesivir protected 80 percent of the cynomolgus macaques and 100 percent of the rhesus macaques, which are biologically closer to humans.

The drug not only cleared the virus from the treated monkeys' blood but also triggered an immune response, helping them develop antibodies while avoiding organ damage.

Geisbert explained that while the number of monkeys was relatively small, the study was statistically powerful because they were exposed to an extraordinarily high dose of the virus -- roughly 30,000 times the lethal dose for humans. This reduced the need for additional control monkeys, limiting unnecessary animal deaths.

The researcher, who has worked on Ebola since the 1980s and is credited with discovering the Reston strain, said one of the most exciting aspects of Obeldesivir is its “broad-spectrum” protection, compared to the approved antibody treatments that only work against the Zaire species of Ebola.

“That’s a huge advantage,” Geisbert said.

Pharmaceutical maker Gilead is currently advancing Obeldesivir to Phase 2 clinical trials for Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola.

Geisbert also emphasized the importance of funding from the US National Institutes of Health, amid reports that dozens of grants have been canceled under President Donald Trump’s administration.

“All these drugs and vaccines that were developed against Ebola and a lot of these exotic viruses and pathogens -- 90 percent of the money comes from the US government,” he said, adding, “I think the general public would agree we need treatments for Ebola.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741958633.0,"El Paso, Juarez vigilant as 16 measles cases reported in Chihuahua","EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – Authorities in Chihuahua, Mexico, say they have confirmed 15 measles cases in a Mennonite community in the western portion of the state. A 16th case has been confirmed in the city of Namiquipa.

“We don’t have any cases in Juarez; the cases we have are (near) Cuauhtemoc,” said Dr. Rogelio Covarrubias, director in Juarez of the Chihuahua Health Department. “We are not on alert, we have not declared an emergency, but we are concerned, and we are working hard because measles can spread anywhere in the state.”

Most cases were detected in the Mennonite camps north of Cuauhtemoc, which is 270 miles or a five-hour drive south of El Paso, Texas.

Chihuahua health authorities believe residents who have family in Texas or who traveled there to acquire farming implements carried the illness back home.

They are concerned because they don’t have an accurate count of how many adults in the Mennonite camps are immunized against measles. Children enrolled in Mexican schools typically get the vaccine.

West Texas and New Mexico communities have reported more than 250 cases, and two unvaccinated individuals have died from measles-related causes, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-nine people in Texas remained hospitalized due to the illness on Tuesday.

Covarrubias said Chihuahua health authorities communicate regularly with their counterparts in El Paso when it comes to measles and other communicable diseases.

“We have good communication with the El Paso Health Department and the (Mexican) consulate in El Paso […] to learn of possible cases in El Paso and among those who come to Juarez to visit family,” he said.

El Paso health officials are aware of the situation in western Chihuahua and encourage residents on both sides of the border to make sure they and their family members are vaccinated.

“We know that for infectious diseases or any other diseases there are no borders. So, whatever, affects our region is going to be affecting either side of the border,” said Paso City-County Health Authority Dr. Hector I. Ocaranza.

He said El Paso and Juarez not only have a good working relationship on health issues, but also share best practices.

“We know the Mennonites are a very mobile community and we know they are going to be crossing through El Paso – and El Paso is a big travel hub for not just the Mennonites but many people – so, that’s why we’re expecting to see cases of measles here in El Paso because of the close proximity that we have in the west part of Texas and east part of New Mexico,” Ocaranza said.

Public Health Ontario is reporting 372 total cases since an outbreak began on Oct. 28, 2024. That’s a jump of 195 cases since the agency’s last report on Feb. 27.

The public health agency described the latest numbers of the highly contagious airborne disease as being a “sharp increase,” attributing the outbreak expansion to transmission among unimmunized children and teens. 

Dr. Christine Navarro, a public health physician at Public Health Ontario, says the agency is on alert and she expects there to be more cases in the coming weeks. 


“It is unusual to see this kind of spread. It’s not something that we’ve experienced in the province in many, many years, certainly not since elimination of measles in Canada in 1998,” Navarro said. 

Almost all of the new cases are connected to an interprovincial outbreak first reported in New Brunswick, which has also spread to Manitoba. 

The spread has resulted in 31 hospitalizations in Ontario, including one child who required intensive care. Of those who were hospitalized, 30 were unvaccinated and one person’s immunization status was unknown.

Seven cases were reported in pregnant people — five unvaccinated, and two had two doses of the measles vaccine.Navarro said when people get infected despite being immunized, it’s called a “breakthrough” case, which they do expect to occasionally see.

MERS is an often-severe respiratory infection caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), leading to symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough. It spreads among camels and can infect humans, usually through direct or indirect contact with camels. The virus rarely spreads from person to person.

Of the four infected men aged 27 to 78 years, all of whom had underlying medical conditions, one was exposed to the virus in a hospital, and one was indirectly exposed to camels and their raw (unpasteurized) milk. None were healthcare workers. The cases were reported in Saudi Arabia's Hail (2), Riyadh (1), and Eastern (1) provinces. 

No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV–specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development.
The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health followed up on the men's close contacts, finding no other secondary infections. The last case was reported on February 4, 2025.

""The notification of these four cases does not alter the overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels,"" the WHO said. ""The reporting of these cases shows that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels, particularly those in the Middle East.""

**Case-fatality 36% since 2012**

Since MERS was first detected in humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 2,618 people from 27 countries in all six WHO regions have been infected, with a case-fatality rate of 36%. The vast majority of cases, 84%, have been identified in Saudi Arabia. No MERS infections have been reported outside the Middle East since 2019.

""No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV–specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development,"" the WHO wrote.

It has been discovered that a healthcare worker at Nepean Hospital's Birth Unit was infectious with hepatitis B between 2013 and 2024.

Officials warned that 223 women who gave birth at the hospital may have had a ""potential low-risk exposure"".

NSW Health has also reviewed the care of 143 children.

Patients who had certain procedures performed by the affected healthcare worker will be contacted.
The procedures include: episiotomy, repairs for episiotomy or perineal/vaginal tear, or application for foetal scalp electrodes (mother and baby). 

NSW Health said it had worked with the healthcare worker to remove any further risk of transmission to patients.

The potential for exposure is low-risk, according to NSW Health.

""Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District understands hearing this may cause concern within our community and to those directly impacted, for this we extend our sincerest apologies,"" NSW Health said in a statement.

""The NSW Health Blood Borne Viruses Advisory Panel has reviewed the care provided by the healthcare worker and determined the risk of transmission is low for 223 women and 143 children.

""As a precaution, NBMLHD is offering free assessment and testing for hepatitis B for those women and children who may have been at risk. [...] 

NSW Health Minister Ryan Park apologised on behalf of NSW health.﻿

""We understand people are concerned,"" he told 2GB radio.

""I would be, if it was my wife or my child, I understand that.

""That is why we want to move as quickly and effectively as we can.

""I understand people are concerned, and we apologise for that.""

Hepatitis B is a liver disease that is caused by the hepatitis B virus.

According to NSW Health, it can be transmitted during birth, during sex and through blood-to-blood contact.

Hepatitis B is detected by a blood test which can show if a person has current infection or has had hepatitis B in the past and is no longer infectious.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741958414.0,Yellow Fever Fatality Rate Increases 20%,"Over the past few centuries, yellow fever outbreaks have led to numerous cases and related fatalities. While the World Health Organization says most severe yellow fever (YF) cases have a fatality rate of around 39%, recent data from South America indicates an unfortunate increase in deaths.

Since 2024, the Republic of Colombia has faced an active YF outbreak. **As of 21 Feb 2025, 40 cases have been confirmed (17 in 2025), with 19 related deaths, representing a case fatality rate (CFR) of 47%.**

As of mid-March 2025, Columbia's YF outbreak remains active in the departments of Tolima, Caquetá, Huila, Nariño, Putumayo, and Vaupés.

**Throughout South America, between the last months of 2024 and the first weeks of 2025, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported 61 cases of YF, 30 of which resulted in death, for a CFR of 49%.**

These increased CFRs are similar to those reported between 2022 and 2023 in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.

**According to the PAHO, one factor in the approximate 20% increase in CFR is the expanded geography of YF-transmitting mosquitos.**

The PAHO recently issued an epidemiological alert regarding a change in the geographic distribution of the YF disease. All cases had a history of exposure in areas at risk for the YF virus, such as wild and wooded areas, in the context of work activities that included agriculture, and had no documented vaccination history.

Another factor is that these new areas are unprepared to diagnose and treat YF infection before the infection worsens.

""A single case of yellow fever can constitute an outbreak, as it can spread rapidly. Therefore, one of the ways this disease is monitored is by observing how it behaves in nature. When non-human primates begin to become infected and die, this alerts us to the activity and potential spread of the virus, and allows us to anticipate epidemics in humans,"" explained Jairo Méndez Rico, Regional Advisor for Viral Diseases at PAHO's Department of Health Emergencies in a media release on 11 Mar 2025.

Various studies have determined that mosquito-borne diseases such as YF, chikungunya, dengue, and malaria are expanding their range and re-emerging in areas where they had subsided for decades. The extent to which climate change influences the population at risk of mosquito-borne diseases varies across altitudes.

In March 2025, the PAHO and the U.S. CDC continue encouraging everyone visiting a yellow fever endemic area to be protected by vaccination. YF vaccines have been found safe and effective and are commercially available at certified travel clinics and pharmacies in the United States.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741895651.0,Study: MIS-C may be triggered by latent Epstein-Barr virus,"A new study suggests that kids who develop MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), a severe complication following COVID-19 infections, may do so because COVID reactivates a latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in their bodies. The study appears in Nature.

For 5 years, researchers have struggled to explain how MIS-C, a severe inflammatory response that mimics symptoms of toxic shock and Kawasaki shock syndromes, can occur in children who seem to recover completely from mild or even asymptomatic COVID infections. Kids with MIS-C typically develop the condition 4 to 8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

German researchers say the answer may be in virus-reactive memory T cells, which are triggered by COVID infection. 

We’ve now found indications, however, that a resurgence of a second pathogen—Epstein-Barr virus—is responsible for the inflammatory shock.
“We’ve now found indications, however, that a resurgence of a second pathogen—Epstein-Barr virus—is responsible for the inflammatory shock. Put simply, it wakes up from a dormant state because the COVID infection has thrown the child’s immune system in such disarray that it becomes unable to keep the dormant infection in check,” said Tilmann Kallinich, MD, co-senior author of the study, in a press release from Charite hospital in Berlin. 

80.7% OF MIS-C patients seropositive for EBV
Epstein-Barr is the virus that causes mononucleosis, and while some have symptoms, almost 90% of people are infected, and most never have a symptom, but EBV is dormant in immune cells. 

In the study, 145 children aged 2 to 18 years old who had been treated for MIS-C in European hospitals were compared to 105 controls who had COVID-10 but never developed MIS-C. Researchers found that 80.7% of kids with MIS-C had evidence of EBV in blood samples, compared to 56.0% of controls. EBV antibody titers were higher in patients with MIS-C compared with controls and treated patients, the authors said.

They added that COVID may trigger an inflammatory immune response in kids that damages organs.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741882756.0,Vitamin A and Measles: What the data show (and how to talk about it) (via Your Local Epidemiologist),"Last week, Secretary Kennedy appeared on national news, linking the recent measles outbreak to poor nutrition and health and emphasizing the role of vitamin A in preventing measles-related deaths.

Did he pull this out of thin air? Not entirely—there are kernels of truth in his claims. However, as he often does, he left out critical context. And when falsehoods spread from one of the country’s highest health offices, it can have real consequences for families trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions.

So, what do we know about vitamin A and measles? Perhaps more importantly, why do some gravitate toward vitamin A over the MMR vaccine?

**TLDR: RFK Jr. has vastly overstated vitamin A’s role in measles in a U.S. context, which can have dramatic consequences. The measles vaccine provides by far the best protection. Regardless, understanding why people believe in falsehoods is crucial—it's the key to making real progress in these conversations.**

When it comes to measles, vitamin A is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for people who contract the disease. But there’s a key reason why.

The WHO serves 197 countries, many of which are low- and middle-income nations where vitamin A deficiency is a major public health issue, particularly among children. In these areas, vitamin A deficiency does make measles far more dangerous because it plays a crucial role in immune dysfunction, particularly in T cell responses and antibody production.

Supplementing among deficient children significantly reduces measles mortality:

A meta-analysis of more than 1 million children across 19 countries found that vitamin A supplementation reduces measles-related mortality by 12%.

An analysis of eight randomized controlled trials found no overall mortality reduction from vitamin A. However, in three studies focused on African children under two years old, vitamin A supplementation reduced mortality by 79%.

However—and this is important—context matters.

Only 0.3% of the U.S. population has a vitamin A deficiency.

While we don’t have large-scale U.S. data because measles is now quite rare thanks to vaccination, smaller studies from other high-income countries with similarly low levels of vitamin A deficiency suggest vitamin A doesn’t make much of a difference for measles:

A study of hospitalized measles patients in Italy found no effect of vitamin A treatment on outcomes.

A study in Japan found that vitamin A supplementation did not reduce pneumonia risk in measles patients, though it did slightly shorten cough and fever duration.

We also have a case study during a huge Samoa measles outbreak. All patients were given vitamin A, but there were still 89 deaths.

There is some data to suggest vitamin A levels may drop during a measles infection, which is partly why physicians in the U.S. often give vitamin A to children with severe measles requiring hospitalization. When administered in controlled doses under the supervision of a doctor, it is a low-risk intervention, which is why many physicians in Texas are likely giving it to hospitalized measles patients right now and why WHO has a sweeping recommendation. But in the U.S., it’s unclear how much it’s really helping.

Why doesn’t everyone just take vitamin A? Because you can overdose on it.

Home supplementation of vitamin A is risky, especially for children. Since vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, excess amounts can’t be easily excreted and can build up to toxic levels. This can lead to liver damage and other serious health issues.

This risk is compounded by the fact that supplements in the U.S. aren’t well regulated. Unlike prescription medications, vitamin A supplements sold at stores like CVS aren’t tested for consistency or purity by the FDA—meaning the actual dose in each pill can vary.

Vitamin A does not prevent measles
Another danger is that parents might misinterpret this information, thinking vitamin A can prevent measles (it can’t), and give it to their children unnecessarily (which can lead to toxicity). [...] 

Behind the rumor: Why people gravitate to vitamins over vaccination

RFK Jr. ’s embrace of vitamin A and his suggestion that poor diet and exercise are to blame for measles complications are no surprise. His views align with a more subtle form of germ theory denialism, outlined in his recent book, which has gained traction in popular culture.

This perspective doesn’t deny the existence of germs outright but argues that people only become vulnerable to infectious diseases when their immune systems are weakened by poor nutrition or environmental toxins. 

It follows the same logic as the “comorbidity fallacy”—the idea that Covid-19 deaths weren’t truly caused by the virus but rather by underlying health conditions, poor diet, or lack of exercise.

This belief is particularly tricky because underlying health conditions and poor diet can impact immune functioning. A balanced, nutrient-dense diet is one of the best things you can do to support your health. However, diet alone will never fully protect us from every disease. Immunity is complex, relying on a balance of many factors. Even the healthiest person can die from an infectious disease.

Nevertheless, it has become extremely popular because it:

Gives people a sense of control. The fear of an invisible infectious disease is real and powerful, and exposure to germs is often outside our control. The idea that diet and exercise can serve as a personal shield is deeply comforting.

Allows people to bypass the healthcare system. For those who distrust the healthcare system or can’t access it due to lack of insurance (or both), relying on diet and supplements feels like a way to take charge of their health without needing a doctor’s prescription.

Appeals to our love of nature. There are many wonderful things (and medicines) that come from nature, and “natural living” is a value system that many people hold dear.

To effectively communicate about vitamin A and measles, we must recognize that charts and facts alone won’t change minds. While evidence is essential, people’s gravitation towards natural remedies and supplements is often driven by deeply held values, distrust in healthcare, lack of access to reliable healthcare, and the very human desire for control over our health. The vast majority of people truly want what’s best for their children, and if we just throw more facts at them without understanding their motivations, the conversation won’t get very far.

**Bottom line**

Vitamin A can help treat measles in children who are deficient in vitamin A, but the benefit for children in the U.S. is far less clear. Vaccination is by far the best way to prevent measles, but when chatting about it, remember that facts alone often don’t change minds—acknowledging and connecting over the values underlying people’s health decisions is a better approach.

A joint report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's fund, Unicef, said children under the age of five accounted for more than 40% of the cases reported in Europe and central Asia.

""Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call,"" Hans Henri Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said. ""Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security."" [...]

Kennedy Jr. once again spread misleading claims about the safety and efficacy of the measles vaccine amid an outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.

In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity broadcast Tuesday, Kennedy said “natural immunity” after getting a measles infection is more effective at providing lasting protection against the disease. However, Kennedy left out that the dangers of catching the disease outweigh the advantage of immunity, according to doctors.

“It used to be when you and I were kids, everybody got measles,” Kennedy told Hannity. “And measles gave you protection, lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people, for life, but many people it wanes.”

Despite Kennedy’s claims, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the majority of people who have had the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccines will be protected for life. The CDC also has guidance for people it recommends should be revaccinated. [...] 

Kennedy added that he would make sure that “anybody who wants a vaccine can get one,” noting that he is against forcing people to take it.

“I’m a freedom of choice person,” Kennedy said. “We should have transparency. We should have informed choice. And — but if people don’t want it, the government shouldn’t force them to do it.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741809073.0,"COVID is still evolving and will find new ways to evade immune systems, scientists say","When the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, many scientists thought it would evolve slowly, like other coronaviruses.

But that was one of the first big surprises from the virus dubbed SARS-CoV-2. It evolved like crazy.

""SARS-CoV-2 so far has probably been even faster than influenza virus, which is really remarkable,"" says Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. ""I thought it would undergo some evolution, but the speed at which it's undergone that evolution and the ability it's shown to undergo these big evolutionary jumps is really remarkable.""

In fact, SARS-CoV-2 has been evolving the ability to evade the immune system about twice as fast as the fastest-evolving flu virus, punctuated by several large evolutionary jumps, scientists say. Most notoriously, SARS-CoV-2 jumped a huge evolutionary hurdle to spawn the omicron variant, which spread around the world with shocking speed.

And the pace of the virus's evolution hasn't changed much. The virus has kept evolving, averaging more than a dozen significant changes every year as the virus begets new additions to the rogue's gallery of variants.

""It's possible that the evolution of the virus has slowed down a little bit. But the evolution of the virus has not stopped,"" Bloom says.

But all of the meaningful new viral offspring have been descendants of omicron. So instead of getting new Greek letter names, the omicron subvariants go by tongue-twisters like BA.2.86, XBB.1.6 and JN.1.

Each new member of this menagerie of mutants just keeps finding new ways to try to get around the human immune system, enabling the virus to infect more than 700 million people worldwide and kill more than 7 million, according to the World Health Organization.

The immune system strikes back

But something else has changed: the human immune system.

""As we got infected by the virus — but also really importantly as we saw the vaccines roll out — that just built up immunity in the population, which means that SARS-CoV-2 all of a sudden ran into this immunity wall,"" says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in California. ""And with the immunity wall, we have SARS-CoV-2 at least a little bit cornered now.""

That's because the immunity wall keeps most people from getting very sick when they catch the virus.

""It's the fact that we have immunity that is largely responsible for making it seem like this virus is less dangerous,"" says Michael Worobey, who studies the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona.

That doesn't mean the virus isn't dangerous anymore. SARS-CoV-2 still makes lots of people sick, even so sick they sometimes end up in the hospital or die. Hundreds are still dying every week in the U.S. from COVID, mostly older people and people with other health problems.

But the virus has essentially become endemic, meaning: This is the new normal. The virus is here to stay. But SARS-CoV-2 is no longer upending daily life.

""The immunity we've built up — it makes it like trying to start a forest fire after a few weeks' heavy rain versus when everything's tinder dry,"" says Jeremy Kamil, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh.

Most experts think this dynamic will continue for the foreseeable future. The virus will continue to evolve new ways to try to get around immune defenses. But most people's immune systems are able to keep the virus in check by learning from mild infections and vaccinations.

""We may just continue on in this phase of subvariants of subvariants of subvariants. [This] might just be what we deal with for decades and decades and decades,"" Worobey says.

**The ""immunity wall"" needs maintenance**

Many experts say it's unlikely that a much more dangerous new variant might emerge anytime soon. But they stress that it remains crucial to maintain the immunity wall to try to keep that from happening.

""That wall of immunity is something that is built up over time but it also can erode over time. So to keep up that wall, it's important that we continue to use tools to protect ourselves,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, who runs Brown University's Pandemic Center.

People can protect themselves by getting updated vaccines once or twice a year to boost waning immunity, she says.

""Every time the virus replicates it's basically buying a couple evolutionary lottery tickets,"" says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. ""Most of those are losers. But sometimes it hits a winner. So the key that people should think about, if they want to slow that process, is: Don't give the virus more opportunities to replicate. Don't let it buy any new lottery tickets.""

That's one of the dangers of cutting international aid funding for HIV drugs to AIDS patients, experts say. Major new variants like omicron are believed to have emerged from a chronic infection in a patient whose immune system was suppressed.

""We've been surprised again and again by the evolution of this virus,"" says Sarah Otto, a theoretical biologist at the University of British Columbia. ""New variants with a lot of change can emerge like this and spread like wildfire.""",1j9t3vf,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5312100/covid-virus-mutation-evolution,161

And today Philadelphia health officials are warning about a new measles case in that city, noting that the patient could have exposed others at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) earlier this week, while New York officials say the first case of measles in the state outside of New York City was detected in a young child in Suffolk County.

And a new monthly report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warns that Europe is seeing significantly more cases this year than last.

LA patient traveled on China Airlines 

The LAX case involves the first measles patient diagnosed in 2025 in a Los Angeles County resident, and the person possibly exposed others who were on a March 5 China Airlines flight that landed at LAX and were in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX that evening. 

Officials said the person later visited a nail salon and a grocery store while infectious. Exposed people should confirm vaccination against measles, authorities said. 

""With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine,"" said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County health officer, in the press release. ""Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to others before they feel sick or have symptoms.""

Prior to this, the last case of measles in a Los Angeles County resident was reported in February 2024.

**Philly, NY cases not tied to other outbreaks**

In Philadelphia, the measles patient is not connected to a case in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, or to outbreaks in west Texas, Oklahoma, or New Mexico. Instead, the patient was likely exposed during international travel. 

""We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles."" said Philadelphia Health Commissioner Palak Raval-Nelson, PhD, MPH.  ""As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible.""

The Suffolk County, New York, child, who authorities said was under the age of 5 years, represents the third measles case in New York this year. Authorities said there is no connection to ongoing outbreaks in the most recent case, and they urged New York residents to check their MMR immunization status.

""Measles can be very serious. It's much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization. The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not,"" State Health Commissioner James McDonald, MD, MPH, said in a news release.

Late last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues a Health Alert Network notice on US measles cases and warned travelers to be cautious during upcoming spring break travel. 

**Rising cases in Europe**

Overseas, meanwhile, from February 2024 to January 2025, a total of 32,265 people were diagnosed as having measles in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), a sharp jump from the 2,361 cases reported in 2023. 

The most cases were reported by Romania (27,568), Italy (1,097), Germany (637), Belgium (551), and Austria (542), the ECDC said in a monthly report on measles and rubella. 

During the period, Romania recorded 18 deaths attributed to measles and Ireland noted 1. Only Latvia and Liechtenstein reported zero cases.

""Although there is variation in the proportion of imported cases by country, the majority of cases in the EU/EEA acquired measles through local/community transmission within the reporting country,"" the report states. 

Of the 32,265 patients with known age, 14,556 (45.1%) were children under 5 years; 8,721 patients (27.0%) were aged 15 years or older.

Among 10,886 patients ages 1 to 4 years, 82.7% were unvaccinated, 1,082 (9.9%) were vaccinated with one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, 43 (0.4%) were vaccinated with two or more doses, and 757 (7%) were vaccinated with an unknown number of doses.

The child became sick in recent days after returning with their family from traveling internationally and has been isolated from most community settings while they have been contagious, according to the department. There is believed to be a low risk to the public.

The positive test result came on 10 March. The only place that has been confirmed as a possible exposure site is Copley hospital in Morrisville, where the child was being evaluated the previous day.

Hospital staff have already contacted visitors who had been in the emergency department between 3.15pm and 6pm on Sunday, the department says.

**The case is not related to the three ongoing domestic outbreaks of measles in the US, nor is it related to the current measles outbreak in Quebec, health officials confirmed.**",1j9jle4,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/measles-outbreak-vermont,383
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741826035.0,Most of Quebec’s 36 measles cases contracted in health-care settings,"The number of measles cases continues to rise in Quebec.

A total of 36 cases have been confirmed, including 28 in the Laurentians. In addition to the Montreal, Laval, and Montérégie regions, which are affected by outbreaks, the Eastern Townships was recently added to the list.

The current measles epidemic began in December 2024. The Quebec government’s website, which lists the locations and dates of possible exposure to a measles case, indicates that most cases were contracted in health-care facilities and pharmacies. There are also several cases in schools and daycares.

Last week, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) warned the March break travel season could lead to an increase in measles cases, **which are already higher in the country for the first two months of 2025 than for all of 2024.**

**Ontario is the most affected province. As of Feb. 26, it had 119 confirmed and 23 probable cases of measles. New Brunswick, British Columbia, and Manitoba also have a few reported cases.**

An increase in the spread of measles has been observed in several countries. The United States is affected by outbreaks of the disease, particularly in Texas and New Mexico, which now have more than 250 cases. A school-aged child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week. The deceased were not vaccinated against measles.

The main symptoms of measles are a high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash on the face and then the body. Complications of measles include pneumonia, deafness, encephalitis, and, in severe cases, death.

If an unvaccinated person has been in contact with a measles case, they must self-isolate at home from day five to day 14 after exposure. A person is not contagious for the first four days after exposure.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741721109.0,His Daughter Was America’s First Measles Death in a Decade,"Peter greeted me in the mostly empty gravel parking lot of a Mennonite church on the outskirts of Seminole, a small city in West Texas surrounded by cotton and peanut fields. The brick building was tucked in a cobbled-together neighborhood of scrapyards, metal barns, and modest homes with long dirt driveways. No sign out front advertised its name; no message board displayed a Bible verse. No cross, no steeple—nothing, in fact, that would let a passerby know they had stumbled on a place of worship. When my car pulled up, Peter emerged to find out who I was.

He hadn’t been expecting a stranger with a notepad, but he listened as I explained that I had come to town to write about the measles outbreak, which had by that point sent 20 people from the area to the hospital and caused the death of an unnamed child, the disease’s first victim in the United States in a decade.

Of course Peter knew why Seminole was in the news. He had heard that President Trump was asked about the outbreak here during a Cabinet meeting, and he told me that he didn’t like the attention. The Mennonites were being unjustly singled out. It wasn’t like they were the only ones who came down with measles. The coverage, he insisted, was “100 percent unfair.” He didn’t think it was just the Seminole area that had problems; he said that he had family in Canada and Mexico who had also gotten measles recently. I told him I’d heard that the child who’d passed away might have come from his congregation. He said that was true.

Peter dug the toe of his boot into the gravel. I asked him if he knew the family. His voice broke slightly as he answered. “That’s our kid,” he said. [...] 

That’s where I encountered Peter, a wiry 28-year-old man with an angular face who wore a dark-colored, Western-style shirt and jeans. His English was uncertain, and he spoke with a light German accent. Sometimes he responded to my questions with silence.

He declined to reveal his daughter’s name or the family’s last name. Peter was perplexed by the national news coverage, and he did not seem eager to draw more attention to his family and community. He gave only his daughter’s age: She was 6 years old. When I asked him to describe her in more detail, he waved his hand, said she liked what other kids liked. But as we stood in the parking lot, he told me the story of what happened.

Peter’s daughter had been sick for three weeks. The family knew it was measles. He said they took her to the hospital at one point, and she was given cough medicine. “That’s it,” he recalled. “They just say, ‘Go home.’ They don’t want to help us. They say, ‘It’s just normal; go home.’” (A spokeswoman for the Seminole Hospital District declined to comment, citing privacy laws.)

It wasn’t normal, though. Her condition continued to deteriorate, so they brought her back to the doctors. “She just kept getting sicker and sicker,” he told me. “Her lungs plugged up.” Her heart rate and blood pressure dropped, and the doctors put her on a ventilator. “We were there Saturday ’til Monday, three days … and then it was worse, very bad.” Peter shook his head and stared at the ground. He said his daughter died on Tuesday night from pneumonia, which is a common infection in severe measles cases.

Peter’s daughter was not vaccinated. Mennonite doctrine does not prohibit inoculations or modern medicine in general, though I encountered plenty of suspicion among Mennonites I spoke with in Seminole. I met a father who said that he wanted to vaccinate his two daughters but that their mother didn’t think it was a good idea. A grandmother told me she knew of several children who had been given the measles vaccine and were “never the same after that.” A man who'd spent his career installing irrigation equipment said he was suspicious of vaccines in part because he believed that the government had lied about the origins of COVID.

Peter said that he has doubts about vaccines too. He told me that he considers getting measles a normal part of life, noting that his parents and grandparents had it. “Everybody has it,” he told me. “It’s not so new for us.” He’d also heard that getting measles might strengthen your immune system against other diseases, a view Kennedy has promoted in the past. But perhaps most of all, Peter worried about what the vaccine might do to his children. “The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust,” he said. “We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much.” [...] 

The death of his daughter, Peter told me, was God’s will. God created measles. God allowed the disease to take his daughter’s life. “Everybody has to die,” he said. Peter’s eyes closed, and he struggled to continue talking. “It’s very hard, very hard,” he said at last. “It’s a big hole.” His voice quavered and trailed off. “Our child is here,” he said, gesturing toward the building behind him. “That’s why we’re here.”

Peter invited me to come inside the church building. He walked over to the door and held it open. I entered a small, dark, airless room with about a dozen chairs. Peter’s daughter was lying in the middle in a handmade coffin covered with fabric. Her face, framed by blond, braided pigtails, showed no sign of illness. Everything was white: her skin, her dress, the lining of her coffin, the thin ribbons that formed little bows on the cuffs of her sleeves. Her hands were clasped just below her chest. Members of her family were seated all around. No one looked up when I walked into the room. The only sounds were the trill of someone’s cellphone alert and the dry, hacking cough coming from one of her sisters in the corner. [...] 

At one point in the parking lot, Peter had asked me why his daughter matters to the rest of the country. I’d struggled in the moment to come up with an answer. For Peter and his family, the loss of their daughter is a private tragedy, one that would be excruciating no matter how she died. The fact that she died of measles, though, is a sign that something has gone wrong with the country’s approach to public health. Twenty-five years ago, measles was declared “eliminated” in the United States. Now a deadly crisis is unfolding in West Texas.

Before I left the church that day, Peter and I talked for a few more minutes. “You probably know how it goes when somebody passes away,” he said. “It’s hard to believe.” Peter told me he didn’t have anything more to say. Really, what more could be said? Something unbelievable had happened: A young father was grieving the death of his 6-year-old from measles.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741639785.0,"Without Offering Proof, Kennedy Links Measles Outbreak to Poor Diet and Health","In a sweeping interview, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health and human services secretary, outlined a strategy for containing the measles outbreak in West Texas that strayed far from mainstream science, relying heavily on fringe theories about prevention and treatments.

He issued a muffled call for vaccinations in the affected community, but said the choice was a personal one. He suggested that measles vaccine injuries were more common than known, contrary to extensive research.

He asserted that natural immunity to measles, gained through infection, somehow also protected against cancer and heart disease, a claim not supported by research.

He cheered on questionable treatments like cod liver oil, and said that local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics. [...] 

The interview, which lasted 35 minutes, was posted online by Fox News last week, just before the President Trump’s address to Congress. Segments had been posted earlier, but the full version received little attention.

Mr. Kennedy offered conflicting public health messages as he tried to reconcile the government’s longstanding endorsement of vaccines with his own decades-long skepticism.

Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that vaccines “do prevent infection” and said that the federal government was helping ensure that people have access to “good medicines, including those who want them, to vaccines.”

“In highly unvaccinated communities like Mennonites, it’s something that we recommend,” he said.

Mr. Kennedy described vaccination as a personal choice that must be respected, then went on to raise frightening concerns about the safety of the vaccines.

He said he’d been told that a dozen Mennonite children had been injured by vaccines in Gaines County. People in the community wanted federal health workers arriving in Texas “to also look at our vaccine-injured kids and look them in the eye,” Mr. Kennedy said.

Yet the M.M.R. vaccine itself has been thoroughly studied and is safe. There is no link to autism, as the secretary has claimed in the past. While all vaccines have occasional adverse effects, health official worldwide have concluded that the benefits far outweigh the very small risks of vaccination. [...] 

Mr. Kennedy asserted otherwise: “We don’t know what the risk profile is for these products. We need to restore government trust. And we’re going to do that by telling the truth, and by doing rigorous science to understand both safety and efficacy issues.”

In response to questions about Mr. Kennedy’s position on vaccination, a Health and Human Services spokesman pointed to a recent opinion piece in which he wrote that the shots prevented children from contracting measles and protected people who couldn’t be vaccinated.

“However, he believes that ‘the decision to vaccinate is a personal one,’” the spokesman said, referring to Mr. Kennedy’s opinion article.

Mr. Kennedy claimed that it was “very difficult” for measles to kill a healthy person and that malnutrition played a role in the Texas outbreak.

Early in the interview, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged the seriousness of measles infection, noting that it can lead to death, brain swelling and pneumonia.

But he also described the illness as rarely fatal, even before 1963, when the vaccine became available. He said measles has a “very, very low infection fatality rate.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for every thousand people infected with measles in the United States, the virus kills one to three. One study estimated that without vaccination today there would be 400,000 hospitalizations and 1,800 deaths annually. [...] 

In later comments, Mr. Kennedy suggested that severe symptoms mainly affected people who were unhealthy before contracting measles.

“It’s very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person,” he said, adding later that “we see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don’t have good nutrition or who don’t have a good exercise regimen.”

West Texas is “kind of a food desert,” he added. Malnutrition “may have been an issue” for the child who died of measles in Gaines County.

Texas health officials said the child had “no known underlying conditions.”

Dr. Wendell Parkey, a physician in Gaines County with many Mennonite patients, said the idea that the community was malnourished was mistaken. [...] 

In the interview, Mr. Kennedy appeared frustrated that a vaccine-preventable illness rather than chronic disease had drawn national attention during his first weeks as secretary.


“We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country — we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.”

The suggestion that vaccines cause autism has been discredited by dozens of scientific studies. Scientists have pointed out that measles deaths are so upsetting because they are preventable with vaccination.

“Natural immunity” after infection may protect the body against various chronic illnesses, the secretary said.

Asked whether he opposed so-called measles parties — events that parents hold to purposely spread measles from a sick child to healthy children — Mr. Kennedy said he would “never advise someone to get sick.”

But he also praised the benefits of natural immunity, protection gained after becoming infected with a virus, claiming that it lasted longer than vaccine-induced immunity and may later protect against cancers and cardiac disease. [...]

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741624180.0,"Measles outbreak grows, hantavirus, Medicaid popularity, and opioid and HPV deaths decline (via Your Local Epidemiologist)","Good morning! Hope you had an easier time adjusting to the time change than I did—toddlers don’t exactly respect daylight saving time.

Here is your week’s public health news you can use.


**The measles outbreak in West Texas is growing.**

This is the most contagious virus, making any public health response resource-heavy. But two obstacles are making this outbreak particularly challenging:

1. The true number of cases is unclear

The official count is 228 cases across 10 counties. (Note: New Mexico’s measles outbreak—30 cases, 1 death—is now genetically linked to Texas, meaning these two outbreaks are one, so I will combine them from here on out.)

It’s very hard to say whether we are at the beginning or middle of the outbreak, mostly because I don’t trust the numbers. Several signs suggest substantial underreporting:

Death ratio. We’ve seen two deaths so far, yet only 228 cases have been reported. Measles typically kills 1 in 1,000 unvaccinated individuals. They were either extremely unlucky, or there are more cases than reported.

Very sick hospitalized patients. By the time these hospitalized children get to the hospital, they are very sick, meaning parents may be delaying care. The second measles fatality (which was an unvaccinated adult) never even went to the hospital.

Epidemiologists are encountering resistance to case investigations.

We don’t just have a murky numerator (case count)—we also have a murky denominator (population size). The community at the center of this outbreak is likely far larger than official U.S. Census figures suggest.

I wager the “true” count is much higher than reported. A CDC response team is now on the ground, working directly with local and state epidemiologists to help get this under control. 

**2. First taste of RFK Jr. and falsehoods**

When an unfamiliar epidemiologist with a clipboard parachutes into a community, their impact is often limited because trust takes time to build. Effective outbreak response depends on local partnership—especially with trusted messengers. But in West Texas, some of the most trusted voices are actively working against public health:

Some local physicians are pushing unproven treatments—like budesonide, vitamin A, and cod liver oil—as substitutes for vaccination. Bulk shipments of these false remedies are being flown in.

Some pastors are celebrating low vaccination rates, including T-shirts bragging about being the “least vaccinated county.”

Messages are making their way into Secretary Kennedy’s talking points, including a Fox News segment, a recent op-ed, and his anti-vaccine nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense.

Falsehoods aren’t just a nuisance—they have real consequences. People may experience short-term symptom relief that masks a severe infection, delaying life-saving care. This has already happened at least once in this outbreak. There’s also growing concern about them poisoning themselves due to overdosing on vitamin A.

What does this measles outbreak mean to you? There are a few things to do if you’re in the hot zone, like children as young as 6 months old getting vaccinated and paying attention to exposures. If you’re traveling here for spring break, I would reassess, especially if you have an unvaccinated or immunocompromised family member.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741631158.0,Can Anything Stop Bird Flu?,"

In February 2024, dairy farmers in the northwest corner of the Texas Panhandle noticed that their herds were getting sick. A cow’s temperature would spike, and she would stop eating. Soon, her milk would dry up or turn thick — tests would reveal the milk had twice the normal number of white blood cells. The feverish cows would barely drink any water. As they grew dehydrated, their eyes sank into their heads. Nearly all of them had mastitis: a swollen, painful udder and teats, which made milking difficult.

The disease seemed to be spreading; veterinarians in the region heard from colleagues in Kansas and New Mexico who reported the same constellation of symptoms. On March 14, a group of them got on a conference call with animal-health specialists from around the country, trading information on what they had begun calling “mystery cow disease.” “We made a master list of causes and just started checking it twice,” said Barb Petersen, a veterinarian who cares for 40,000 cows on several dairies near Amarillo. Was it heavy metals in the feed? That could explain why so many herds had gotten sick so quickly. But no, the feed was okay. A bacterial infection? A coronavirus? Every test they ran came back negative. Whatever this was, it wasn’t something any of them had seen in cows before.

Around the same time, some of the farmworkers Petersen saw on her rounds started to fall ill. Most had conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but some developed fevers bad enough to keep them home from work. “We felt like, Gosh, we don’t think this is a coincidence,” Petersen said. “We’ve got to get to the bottom of this.”

Petersen, 41, has the calm forthrightness you might expect in someone used to working with large animals. She spends most of her days on the road, traveling from dairy to dairy. During the early part of the outbreak, she was as busy as she’s ever been: fielding calls from farmers, coordinating lab tests, and tending to sick cows. She came home each day exhausted. “I’m taking off all my farm clothes in the garage,” she said. “I have animals at home, so I’m making sure I’m not trying to bring something home to them.”

A breakthrough came from Kay Russo, a veterinarian who had studied both dairy cows and poultry. Russo told Petersen that she’d been monitoring an outbreak of avian influenza that had spread from Europe to South America, where it had crossed over from birds into the sea-lion population, killing more than 20,000. Had Petersen noticed any dead birds at the dairies? She had. (“A shit ton of dead birds,” in Russo’s words.) Petersen gathered a few and sent them to a lab. The results came back positive for influenza-A subtype H5N1. Bird flu. With that diagnosis in mind, one of Russo’s colleagues tried to get some bovine samples tested for H5N1, but the lab refused. “They wouldn’t run it,” Russo said, “because it wasn’t on their list.” No cow had ever been infected with H5N1 before.

A few days later, Petersen got a call from one of the dairies. The cats on the farm had become seriously ill after drinking milk from the sick cows: Some had gone blind and lost control of their muscles, mucus streaming from their noses and eyes. Many of them died. When Petersen mentioned the cats to Drew Magstadt, her former classmate at Iowa State’s College of Veterinary Medicine, he remembered that neurologic disease was a well-documented symptom of influenza A in cats. He offered to test for the virus if Petersen would send samples to his lab at Iowa State. “Those cats were really the key to finding this out as quickly as we did,” Magstadt said.

At Magstadt’s request, Petersen gathered milk from eight infected cows into plastic tubes and collected the bodies of two dead cats, wrapping them in plastic bags. She shipped it all in a cooler to Magstadt’s lab, more than 600 miles away in Ames. “I don’t want anything leaking,” she said, “so everything was triple bagged. I don’t want anybody at FedEx or UPS getting a surprise.” The samples arrived the morning of March 21, a Thursday, and by that night they had their results: The cats were positive for influenza A, as was the milk. The next day, Magstadt determined via PCR that it was H5N1, and there was a lot of it, especially in the milk. “I was very, very surprised,” he said, “particularly at the amount of virus.”

Magstadt sent Petersen’s samples across town to a lab run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which formally confirmed the presence of H5N1, and the massive apparatus of the federal government began to whir into motion. Petersen was suddenly receiving calls from multiple federal agencies. “Normally, I’m not going to talk to people who are in Washington, D.C., on the weekend,” she said. The response to the outbreak had transformed into a political problem. 

On the following Monday, March 25, the USDA announced that highly pathogenic avian influenza had been found on farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The agency urged farmers to report illnesses, revealed plans for widespread testing and new biosecurity measures, and soon put restrictions on interstate transfers of dairy cows. There was hope, in those days, that the outbreak could be contained.

Now, a year later, the country is, in Russo’s words, “a pot of swirling virus with every species thrown in the middle.” Multiple strains of H5N1 are burning uncontrolled through cattle herds and poultry flocks in almost every region. Farmers have been forced to euthanize millions of chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Pet food made from infected meat has been linked to the deaths of multiple house cats, and the list of species testing positive for bird flu grows longer every day: squirrels and raccoons, dolphins and deer mice, polar bears and rats, skunks and alpacas. In November and December, at an animal sanctuary in Washington, 20 big cats died of the virus, including four cougars, four bobcats, and a tiger.

Most of the 70 human cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been mild. A bad case of pink eye, maybe a fever, then a full recovery. But in January, when authorities in Louisiana announced that a man had died after being exposed to sick and dead birds in his backyard flock, it seemed to signal an ominous turn. Of the 964 human cases of H5N1 reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, nearly 50 percent were fatal.

This was, and is, a crisis that seems to demand an overwhelming response. The longer we allow the virus to run rampant through animal populations, the greater our chances of disaster. Instead, we’ve had a replay of the first year of the COVID pandemic, overseen this time, until recently, by a Democratic president: Early detection gave way to months of confusion and inaction. Good guidance was circumvented or ignored. Each state had its own rules about how to handle an outbreak or whether to test for one in the first place. We are now approaching a moment when our final line of defense for both people and animals may be an effective vaccine — just as the most anti-vaccine administration in history has taken power.

Once again, we are running an experiment to see whether half-measures will be enough to defeat a virus that has proved shockingly successful at spreading around the world. For now, H5N1 remains primarily a threat to birds and cows and the people who raise them. But if that changes, one thing is undeniable: We aren’t prepared. [...] 

“With this new reality we live in where cattle are infected and therefore dairy farmworkers are constantly being exposed,” Worobey said, “you have a situation with an H5 virus that is taking many more shots on goal to get into humans and get past whatever that last barrier is.” At this point, the most reassuring thing you can say is that the virus has been around for 30 years and hasn’t found a way to transmit effectively in humans yet. But Nelson warned against complacency: “My history of studying flu is that whenever you say influenza can’t do something, it does.”

For that reason, Worobey said he rejects the idea that H5N1 can be called low risk. “It seems a bit of a thumb on the scale to me,” he said. “I think the proper thing to appreciate is that we don’t really know the risk.” In the meantime, we’ve created a giant reservoir of novel virus in our dairy cows, 9 million little Wuhan wet markets (or, if you prefer, Wuhan Institutes of Virology) spread around the country, just waiting for the right occasion to spill over into the human population.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741529905.0,Cholera cases reported in the United Kingdom and Germany linked to Ethiopian Holy Water,"Cholera is a potentially fatal infection which causes severe diarrhoea. Infection is usually a result of eating or drinking food or water contaminated with cholera bacteria; _Vibrio cholerae_ (_V. cholerae_). Cholera is no longer a risk in the UK, but it is sometimes reported in returning UK travelers . Cholera vaccines are available in the UK, but are only recommended for certain travelers [1].

An ongoing outbreak of cholera was first reported in Ethiopia on 27 Aug 2022. As of 3 Mar 2025, a total of 223 cholera cases and 4 deaths have been reported for 2025. A total of 58 381 cholera cases and 726 deaths have been reported in Ethiopia since the start of this outbreak in 2022 [2].

On 7 Mar 2025, the United Kingdom (UK) reported 4 cases of cholera (toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1) diagnosed in mid-February 2025, linked to travel to Ethiopia. 

Three UK travelers recently visited Ethiopia, 2 reporting travel to Amhara, western Ethiopia, with 1 of these travelers visiting the holy well at Bermel Giorgis. 

A 4th UK cholera case did not travel, but reported consuming holy water (brought back from Ethiopia by 1 of the returned travelers) before experiencing symptoms. This returned traveler also became ill after consuming the holy water in the UK [3].

Three cases of cholera (toxigenic _V. cholerae_ serogroup O1, biovar El Tor) were also reported in Germany on 27 Feb 2025, linked to travel to Ethiopia.

Two German travelers visited Ethiopia in January 2025 and also brought back a bottle of holy water collected from the Bermel Giorgis holy well in Amhara. 

On return to Germany, they consumed this water, along with a 3rd person (who had not traveled) on 30 Jan 2025. All 3 people then developed cholera symptoms within days and were treated in hospital. Cholera was confirmed in February 2025 [3, 4].

For most travelers, risk of cholera is very low, with estimates of 2 to 3 cases reported per million travelers [1].

For travelers at higher risk, cholera vaccine can be considered (following a full risk assessment) and these travelers include:
- humanitarian aid workers
- people going to areas of cholera outbreaks who have limited access to safe water and medical care
- other travelers to cholera risk areas, for whom cholera vaccination is considered potentially beneficial; due to their occupation, activities or underlying health problems [1].

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741486455.0,Doctors push back as parents embrace Kennedy and vitamin A in Texas measles outbreak,"Reuters) - As a measles outbreak spreads across West Texas, Dr. Ana Montanez is fighting an uphill battle to convince some parents that vitamin A - touted by vaccine critics as effective against the highly contagious virus - will not protect their children.

The 53-year-old pediatrician in the city of Lubbock is working overtime to contact vaccine-hesitant parents, explaining the grave risks posed by a disease that most American families have never seen in their lifetime - and one that can be prevented through immunization.

Increasingly, however, she also has to counter misleading information. One mother, she said, told her she was giving her two children high doses of vitamin A to ward off measles, based on an article posted by Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nearly a decade before he became President Donald Trump's top health official.

""Wait, what are you doing? That was a red flag,"" Montanez said in an interview. ""This is a tight community, and I think if one family does one thing, everybody else is going to follow. Even if I can't persuade you to vaccinate, I can at least educate you on misinformation.""

Kennedy resigned as chairman of Children's Health Defense and has said he has no power over the organization, which has sued in state and federal courts to challenge common vaccines including for measles.

The organization did not respond to a request for comment.

As U.S. health and human services secretary, Kennedy has said vaccination remains a personal choice. He has also overstated the evidence for use of treatments such as vitamin A, according to disease experts.

The supplement does not prevent measles and can be harmful to children in large or prolonged doses, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. It has been shown to decrease the severity of measles infections in developing countries among patients who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, a rare occurrence in the United States.

""I'm very concerned about the messaging that's coming out,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Health in Dallas. ""It's somewhat baffling to me that we're relitigating the effectiveness of vaccines and alternative therapies. We know how to handle measles. We've had six decades of experience."" [...] 

**I'M WILLING TO HOLD OFF'**

A 29-year-old nurse who is the mother of three and is a self-described Kennedy fan visited Montanez's clinic on Thursday. She asked to be identified as Nicole C. - her middle name and last initial - to protect her family's privacy.

She said she values the doctor's advice and appreciated that she never felt judged for not fully vaccinating her school-age daughter and toddler twins - a boy and a girl - with a second dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

After the initial shots, she said she grew more concerned about potential side effects from vaccines and embraced more natural supplements.

She said school officials told her that her daughter would have to miss 21 days of class if she remains under-vaccinated and was exposed to measles.
The risk of contact in Lubbock is real. Montanez called about a dozen families last month because they were exposed to measles in her own waiting room, which she shares with other doctors in the Texas Tech physicians group.

Still, Nicole could not go through with the vaccination during her visit this week. She said she and her husband had prayed about it and believed in their family's God-given immune systems.

""As a mom, you naturally think, 'Oh my goodness, I can't let my daughter miss 21 days of education.' But who knows what effects the vaccine could cause? That could be a lifetime of issues. I'm willing to hold off on the shot,"" she said.

Public health experts have said vaccines for measles and other diseases pose minimal risks of side effects and protect children and adults against diseases that once routinely killed many people.

As flu season worsened this winter, Nicole said she started giving her children a daily dose of strawberry-flavored cod liver oil, which is high in vitamin A, based on information other mothers had shared with her.

Montanez took her vaccine rejection in stride. The doctor said she has persuaded more than a dozen parents to get their children fully vaccinated in recent weeks.

""I think that leaving her and her family enough space to make their own decisions - and being available for any questions - is really my goal,"" Montanez said. ""My hope is that at some point she's going to call me and say, 'Can we go and get the vaccine?'""

As of March 5, 2025, 192 new contacts have been identified and are under follow-up in Kampala, Ntoroko, and Wakiso.

SUDV was first identified in Sudan in June 1976. This is the eighth outbreak, five in Uganda and three in Sudan.

**According to the WHO's Disease Outbreak News (558) published on March 8, 2025, the Ministry of Health (MOH) stated, 'the risk of potential serious public health impact is high.'**The MoH has scaled up its case management strategy to ensure sufficient capacities to provide care for all suspected and confirmed cases in all hot spots

The WHO says SVDV is a severe disease belonging to the same family as Ebola virus disease (EVD).

While several promising candidate therapeutics are currently advancing through clinical development, no licensed treatment is yet available to effectively address potential future outbreaks of EVD caused by the Sudan virus species.

A range of candidate SUDV vaccines and therapeutics are under development.

Since 2020, one vaccine and two candidate therapeutics (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) have been recommended. They are available in Uganda and are being assessed through randomized clinical trial protocols.

Two vaccines licensed against Zaire EVD will not provide cross-protection against SUDV.

Currently, the WHO advises against travel and/or trade restrictions to Uganda.

However, the U.S. CDC has issued a Travel Health Advisory, Level 2, for Unganda in February 2025. 

The CDC says visitors to Uganda should avoid contact with sick people who have symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, and rash, or contact with blood and other body fluids and semen from men who have recovered from EVD until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen.",1j6w8cm,https://www.vax-before-travel.com/2025/03/08/ugandas-8th-sudan-ebola-outbreak-confirms-29-case-fatality-ratio,87
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741440574.0,Texas cities run short of MMR vaccine as measles outbreak drives demand,"As measles cases continue to grow in Texas and New Mexico, with a second death, an unvaccinated adult, reported on Thursday, some Texas cities are seeing shortages amid soaring demand for the highly effective vaccine and as the top US health official, Robert F Kennedy Jr, sows disinformation and mistrust about vaccines.

Ann and Paul Clancy were picking up medications at their local Walgreens in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday and decided to ask the pharmacist about getting the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

The pharmacist said that they were “totally out, and she didn’t know exactly when they would be getting more”, Ann said.

The Clancys wanted to get vaccinated because they have followed the outbreak in the news, including the first measles case detected in Austin last week – an unvaccinated infant who had traveled recently and was not considered part of the wider outbreak of cases.

In addition to keeping themselves safe, the Clancys want to protect their grandchildren and family members with health vulnerabilities.

The pharmacist also mentioned that even doctors’ offices were “having a hard time keeping enough vaccines for kids who needed them”, Ann said.

There are now 198 known cases, 23 hospitalizations and one death from measles in Texas, and 30 known cases and one death in New Mexico.

When customers call Walgreens locations in Austin, they are still able to book appointments for the MMR vaccine – but pharmacists say the doses are out of stock, and that’s true all over the city.

None of the Austin-area Walgreens had MMR vaccines in stock on Thursday, pharmacists said.

Vaccines at CVS pharmacy locations in Austin were also scarce. At least one pharmacy had a few doses left on a first-come, first-served basis. But at another location, the pharmacist said on Friday, “Basically, every location within a 30-mile radius is out.”

At least one CVS in Lubbock – where most of the hospitalized measles patients are being treated – had also run out of stock on Thursday. Some pharmacies in Fort Worth also ran out of the vaccines or had just a handful of doses left on Friday.

Pharmacies at H-E-B, the grocery chain, in Austin are now limiting MMR vaccines to those most at risk, including people born before 1989 who may have only received one dose.

The distributor at Walgreens temporarily ran low on MMR vaccines “due to the spike in demand”, said Carly Kaplan, director of pharmacy communications at Walgreens. But “additional shipments have been arriving this week,” Kaplan said.

“We’re seeing increased demand for the MMR vaccine, but we do still have doses available across our Texas pharmacies and clinics,” said Amy Thibault, lead director of external communications at CVS Pharmacy. “We’re working to get additional vaccine to Texas as quickly as possible.”

H-E-B did not respond to the Guardian’s press inquiry by publication time.

Because measles is such an infectious disease, and the outbreak is already so advanced, it’s difficult to trace contacts and conduct ring vaccinations, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

Instead, officials should focus on “getting the word out about the importance of vaccinating” and countering misinformation about home remedies, like vitamins, that don’t prevent measles, Hotez said.

In areas with lower vaccination rates, “measles can accelerate”, Hotez said. “Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated and undervaccinated populations.” [...] 

The CDC on Friday issued a health alert on the “expanding” outbreak, urging providers to be alert to cases and highlighting MMR vaccination.

“We’ve had, now, two deaths and the epidemic is not waning,” Hotez said. “It still has a lot of momentum behind it, and I don’t see it abating anytime soon, unfortunately,”

Paul Clancy hopes that vaccines become a much bigger priority in Texas’s response before more people are sickened or die.

“They should put the measles vaccination into overdrive, and then they should be setting up vaccination stations,” he said. “Because the measles spread – maybe it’s not going to go as quick as the [Covid] pandemic, but if they don’t do something about it, it will be [like] the pandemic.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741382832.0,West Texas reports nearly 200 measles cases. New Mexico is up to 30,"A historic measles outbreak in West Texas is just short of 200 cases, Texas state health officials said Friday, while the number of cases in neighboring New Mexico tripled in a day to 30.

Most of the cases across both states are in people younger than 18 and people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.

Texas health officials identified 39 new infections of the highly contagious disease, bringing the total count in the West Texas outbreak to 198 people since it began in late January. Twenty-three people have been hospitalized so far.

Last week, a school-age child died of measles in Texas, the nation’s first measles death in a decade. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that they were sending a team to Texas to help local public health officials respond to the outbreak.

Across the state border from the epicenter of the outbreak, Lea County, New Mexico, had 10 cases Thursday after health officials confirmed an unvaccinated adult who died without seeking medical care tested positive for measles. The state medical investigator has not announced the official cause of death, but the state health department said Friday it is “measles-related.”

Also Friday, the number of cases in Lea County shot up 30, according to an update on the state health department website. The agency has said it hasn’t been able to prove a clear connection to the Texas outbreak; on Feb. 14, it said a link is “suspected.” [...] ",1j60ow3,https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-deaths-mmr-vaccine-a1295c78fade561479da65d72d8a5774,448
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741394553.0,How a measles outbreak overwhelmed a small West Texas town,"SEMINOLE, Texas — Last Saturday, Zach Holbrooks walked into a mobile measles screening and vaccine clinic he had helped set up.

As the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, he dropped by to check on how many shots the crew had given out so far that day.

""Has it been busy today?"" Holbrooks asked the two staffers in what's normally a livestock show barn on the outskirts of downtown Seminole. ""Not so far. We've only given one,"" they replied.

Holbrooks works and lives in this town, the county seat, which in the last few weeks became the epicenter of the largest measles outbreak in three decades. [...] 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outbreaks tend to occur when the vaccination rate in a community dips below 95%. The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella on record in Gaines County sits at 82%, according to state health records.

But many children there are homeschooled or attend private primary school, so those rates could be even lower.

Holbrooks has been busy since the outbreak started in late January. He's been setting up mobile testing and vaccination sites; he said this remote part of West Texas has a large immigrant population, many whose immunization records are unknown, so he's been circulating flyers with measles information in different languages.

""We have a mix of people out here, a large German speaking population, Spanish speaking population,"" which he said makes getting residents the right information about disease control even more complicated.

Authorities still don't know how the measles got to Seminole, but John Belcher, the town's former mayor, said he understands why it's spreading beyond the city limits.

Folks who live out here basically have to drive everywhere, he said. They hop in the car or truck and drive miles to get groceries, go to doctor's appointments, attend church and to get to work.

""I'd say within 200 miles, maybe even farther, if there's a metal building out there, it came from products manufactured in Gaines County,"" Belcher said. ""And the building was probably put together by companies from Gaines County.""

People here need to drive about 80 miles to catch a flight at the Lubbock Airport.

Others travel often to nearby communities in Lea County, on the New Mexico side of the state line. That state has reported 10 confirmed measles cases. On Thursday, New Mexico Health officials confirmed that an unvaccinated adult testing positive for the virus has died.

**A sense of normalcy**

In Seminole, the outbreak has mainly infected children since early January.

Local authorities say the Mennonite community has been hit hard by measles, though they don't have an exact number of confirmed cases.

Grub Shack, a restaurant owned and run by a Mennonite family, seems to be running at full steam. Other businesses in downtown Seminole and people just carry on with their daily lives.

Many Mennonites immigrated here in the late 1970s. There remain thousands of Mennonites in Seminole some 50 years later.

Tina Siemens' father moved his family here from northern Mexico in 1976 when she was 8. She was raised Mennonite and manages the West Texas Living Heritage Museum, which tells the history of this part of West Texas' Native American and Mennonite heritage.

While many Mennonites are not against vaccines in principle, Siemens said, some seek other solutions.

""The Mennonites are very keen on home remedies,"" Siemens said. ""So there may be a family that, nobody knows that they might have all had the measles.""

The state's health officials have said there's plenty of vaccine for everyone who needs it, and Holbrooks said he doesn't think it's a lack of access to the vaccine that's spreading measles out here.

At last count, 214 people in Gaines County have been vaccinated for measles since the outbreak. Holbrooks believes that number is not higher because some people fear debunked ideas about its safety.

""I just think there's some vaccine hesitancy, even more so since COVID,"" Holbrooks said. [...] 

Julie Carter has lived in Seminole all her life. Her three kids are adults: 19, 22 and 30 years old. They got the measles vaccine before starting elementary school, but she became a vaccine skeptic when she started researching ways to improve her health.

""I was overweight; I wasn't feeling good,"" Carter said. ""I kind of went on a journey where I got educated. I came across the vaccine thing and wasn't sure how healthy those were.""

Health officials say doubts about vaccines continue to hamper vaccination efforts. Plus, this illness has not been a major public health issue. In 2000, the CDC declared the virus eliminated from the United States.

Holbrooks said that for a lot of younger parents, measles is a thing of the past.

""It's not something that people thought a lot about,"" he said. But he's urging those in the community to do just that because the consequences can be severe. ""If it was just a simple rash, a rash won't lead to brain inflammation, intellectual disability, death, pneumonia, deafness, convulsions.""

And measles, one of the most contagious known viruses, can spread for days without a person feeling sick.

The three WPV1 cases, with onset of paralysis in January and February, were in Sindh and Punjab provinces. The cases bring the country's total WPV1 cases in 2025 to six. Pakistan is one of two countries (along with Afghanistan) where wild poliovirus is still endemic.

The other polio cases reported this week involved circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Among the affected countries is Nigeria, which reported 7 cVDPV2 cases (4 from 2024 and 3 from 2025) in Kano, Borno, and Jigawa provinces, bringing its 2024 total to 98 cases and its 2025 total to 3 cases.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741297928.0,"Without action, Spring Break could create The Gulf of Measles","Sixty days into 2025, the U.S. had the highest number of measles cases this early into the year in three decades. 

Measles has been reported in eight states, with the largest outbreak in Texas, where there have been at least 159 cases and one unvaccinated child has died. The last previous deaths from measles in the U.S. were in 2015 and 2003. [...] 

Public health has taught us that we usually underestimate the potential severity of outbreaks, as we recently saw with COVID-19. Considering the current outbreaks and impending spring break travel, public health strategies need to be implemented now. 

First, cases must be reported in real-time at the local, state and national levels. The Texas Department of State Health Services has been updating numbers daily. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, is updating measles cases weekly. Newsletters and media sources have been providing frequent updates to help fill gaps in CDC reporting over the past month.

Second, we must prepare large-scale measles vaccination events in communities with measles exposures and unvaccinated people. Last year, an outbreak of measles at a Chicago refugee center, to which more than 2,000 people were exposed, was contained through county, state and CDC vaccination efforts, resulting in the vaccination of more than 30,000 individuals. 

However, with recent administrative changes and firings, it is unclear whether the CDC can adequately assist states. In an important action, weeks into the outbreak, it was just announced that the CDC would be assisting in the Texas ground response.  

Texas is now sending vaccination teams to potential areas of measles exposure. To be effective, these efforts need to be deployed immediately where cases occur. Unfortunately, this may not be possible in Louisiana, which states that the Department of Health will no longer encourage mass vaccination.  

Third, state and local Department of Health contact-tracing teams need to expand to prepare for outbreak control. These individuals can help identify those exposed to measles, coordinate vaccination and provide guidance for isolation if an exposed individual is not vaccinated within three days.  

Fourth, we need to realize that there will be a large influx of individuals into areas where potential outbreaks occur. 

Thousands of individuals travel to the Gulf states during spring break and Mardi Gras. If not vaccinated and exposed to somebody with measles, they are at risk for contracting the illness and spreading it across the country as they return home. In 2020, early cases of COVID-19 in several states could be traced to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and spring break in Florida. 

Of immediate concern are reports that an individual with measles traveled to San Antonio. With a 21-day incubation period, measles could easily be in the city as fans visit in early April for the NCAA basketball tournament. 

Individuals traveling to areas where there may be future outbreaks must assess their vaccination status. If not vaccinated or unsure, the measles vaccine can be obtained through your local healthcare provider, retail pharmacy or local Department of Health. 

We must also recognize that the current Texas measles outbreak began in a Mennonite community. An Anabaptist pastor’s conference took place recently in Sarasota, Fla., and there are planned events during March in Pennsylvania. If unvaccinated individuals from communities with measles attend these events, they could be a super-spreader.  

Fifth, we need to acknowledge the importance of community engagement in outbreak control. During the 2019 measles outbreak in Rockland County, N.Y., religious leaders promoted measles vaccination as part of the path out of the outbreak. Without active local engagement in outbreak management, there is the risk of community blame, as reported in Texas. 

Finally, we must inform the public about the facts and truth of measles and current cases. The notion that measles outbreaks of this magnitude are “not unusual” or that vitamin A is a treatment or preventative measure against measles in the U.S. is wrong. 

We also need to recognize the insidious view of anti-vaccine advocates who blame the vaccine for the outbreak, ignoring fact and reason. Scientifically valid information about measles and the measles vaccine can be found from your health care provider and public health and medical associations, including the American Public Health Association, where one of us serves as executive director, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

While grappling with new measles cases, our country is seeing the effects of an uncontrolled outbreak of avian flu H5N1. This virus is devastating the poultry industry, affecting the dairy industry and has sickened at least 70 people and caused one death in the U.S. 

The consequence of the avian flu is being felt across the country, with the rising prices of eggs. But, if measles takes hold, as it has the potential to do, the human toll will not be seen in the price of eggs, but in our children.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741271959.0,Minnesota officials report tetanus case in unvaccinated child in 2024,"The Minnesota Department of Health reported a case of tetanus in an unvaccinated child under 10 years of age in 2024. The child experienced pain and stiffness in the neck, and could not breath on their own. The child were intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The child had no visible wounds, and parents were not aware of any recently healed wounds.

Tetanus is a diagnosis of exclusion, and as the child was unvaccinated, the providers administered tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin immediately while other diagnoses were being ruled out. The child remained hospitalized for a month and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation.

Tetanus is a rare, but a very serious vaccine-preventable disease that causes significant illness and can be fatal. Also called lockjaw, it is a disease caused by bacteria that affects the body's muscles and nerves. Symptoms of tetanus include muscle spasms in the jaw, difficulty swallowing, and stiffness or pain in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, or back. The spasms can spread to the muscles of the abdomen, upper arms, and thighs. Approximately 11% of reported cases of tetanus are fatal.

Tetanus can occur in people who have a skin or deep tissue wound or puncture and who are not up-to-date on their tetanus vaccinations.

Tetanus cannot be spread from person to person. Vaccination is the best way to prevent tetanus. Widespread vaccination against tetanus is critical to controlling the disease.

The tetanus vaccination is usually combined with diphtheria and/or pertussis (DTaP, DT, Tdap, or Td).

- Children should get 5 doses of the DTaP vaccine before age 7; these are usually given at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age and 4-6 years of age.
- Tdap is given to children at 11-12 years of age.
- Adults should get a booster every 10 years. Get one dose of Tdap vaccine if you did not get it as an adolescent. Then, get Td (tetanus-diphtheria) vaccine every 10 years after that.
- Pregnant women should get Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks.

Minnesota health officials say this case highlights the importance of routine vaccination for tetanus.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741273485.0,‘He needs to do much more’: RFK Jr.'s measles response under scrutiny,"As a deadly measles outbreak spread across Texas, the nation’s top health official took to Instagram on Sunday to blast out a message to his nearly 5 million followers.

“Afternoon mountaineering above Coachella Valley,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote in a caption alongside photos of himself hiking in California.

The post quickly ricocheted around the department, dismaying officials working overtime to track and contain the highly contagious disease, according to two people close to the response effort granted anonymity to describe a sensitive situation. Measles had infected more than 140 people in west Texas in a matter of weeks, killing a child and fueling fears more outbreaks would soon emerge throughout the country.

To his critics and even some increasingly concerned allies, the episode epitomized the worryingly casual attitude that Kennedy has taken in public toward managing the first major health crisis on his watch, according to a half-dozen current and former administration officials, outside advisers and other public health officials, most of whom were granted anonymity to speak candidly. [...] 

“It’s a serious role, he’s just a couple of weeks in and measles is not a common occurrence, and it should be all hands on deck,” said one former Trump official granted anonymity to describe private conversations with current administration health officials. “When you’re taking a selfie out at Coachella, it’s pretty clear that you’re checked out.” [...] 


The shifting messaging has generated unease in some corners of the Trump administration. On Monday, top HHS spokesperson Thomas Corry announced his resignation after two weeks on the job, in part over what two people familiar with the matter described as frustration with Kennedy’s approach to the outbreak.

Kennedy’s promotion of vitamin A as a measles treatment in a Sunday Fox News op-ed also prompted one of his own advisers to publicly jump in and urge parents to “please do not rely” on it for protection.

“He could be misinterpreted that vitamin A will save your suffocating suffering child,” Brett Giroir, a first-term Trump health official now advising Kennedy on infectious disease policy, wrote in a post on X. “It will not.”

In Texas, some local officials have grown concerned that Kennedy’s messaging risks diluting their own communication efforts. They warn that his equivocations could undermine their only hope of ending the outbreak: persuading people to get the measles vaccine.

“We don’t want to diminish the primary message,” Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, Texas, said in an interview. “It’s the vaccines that are the most important.” [...] 

Most importantly, health experts said, Kennedy could simply hit the bar already set by health officials in Texas: Declaring unequivocally that vaccination is the central way to contain the outbreak.

During his January confirmation hearings, Kennedy countered criticism of his anti-vaccine activism by portraying himself as uniquely positioned to rebuild public trust and sell similarly skeptical Americans on the value of safe and effective vaccines.

Kennedy now has a clear opportunity to make good on that argument, Gostin said. But so far, he’s yet to seize it.

“All states are at risk — blue and red,” said Gostin. “He needs to do much more.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741288358.0,Second cluster reported in Uganda's Ebola Sudan outbreak,"A second illness cluster has been identified in Uganda's Ebola Sudan outbreak, with the latest cases linked to the recently reported death of a 4-year-old boy from the virus, officials from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said today.

Both newly confirmed patients are undergoing treatment, the agency said.

Ngashi Ngongo, MD, MPH, PhD, principal adviser to the Africa CDC's director-general and its mpox incident manager, said at a briefing today that there are no direct epidemiologic links between the new cluster and the last one. He added, however, that genetic sequencing shows that the same strain is involved, which likely rules out a new jump from animals and suggests that undetected transmission is highly likely.

Besides the boy, two other cases were confirmed, which follow a report yesterday from the World Health Organization African regional office that the boy's mother had died a few weeks earlier after an acute illness after giving birth. The baby died about a week later, and lab tests weren't conducted before they were buried. The WHO said the two are now considered as probable cases.

**Fourteen cases from 5 districts**

The new developments push the outbreak total to 14 cases, 12 confirmed and 2 listed as probable—involving the mother of the 4-year-old and her baby. Two deaths are reported among the confirmed cases, involving the index patient, who was a healthcare worker, and the 4-year-old boy, who recently died.

Five districts are now affected, up from three in the Africa CDC's last report.

Mosoka Papa Fallah, PhD, acting director of the science and innovation directorate at Africa CDC, said the two newly confirmed patients are isolated and receiving treatment.

Officials said 69 new contacts have been identified and are under monitoring.

**Probe to uncover earlier infections**

Fallah said intensive efforts are under way to better identify how the outbreak started. Retrospective serosurveys will be done among the earlier contacts to assess via antibodies detected in the blood if any were exposed to the virus earlier. He also said health officials will be doing a deeper dive into medical records that involve illness clusters and deaths.

The outbreak was first announced at the end of January, and, within days, Uganda's health ministry, with support from its partners, launched a trial of a candidate Ebola vaccine developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit vaccine research organization based in New York City. Officials said today that 264 contacts have been vaccinated so far. The delivery of 2,000 doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir for treatment is ongoing.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741205664.0,"Report: Influenza A and B clinically different, and type B patients less likely to receive antiviral","Although they have similar 90-day death rates, influenza types A and B have unique clinical trajectories, and patients with type A are more likely to receive the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), French researchers report today in CMI Communications.

For the retrospective, multicenter study, the investigators evaluated adults who sought care at one of three tertiary-care hospitals and were diagnosed as having influenza A (234 patients) or B (113) from 2016 to 2018. They also characterized the clinical course by flu type and identified risk factors for poor outcomes across demographic factors, underlying medical conditions, and clinical parameters. The average patient age was 69 years, and 21% were vaccinated against flu.

""While both viruses share overlapping clinical presentations, influenza B circulates less widely due to its exclusive human reservoir and accounts for approximately 23% of annual cases in temperate regions,"" the researchers wrote. ""Studies evaluating the differences in their epidemiology and patient outcomes remain limited, highlighting the need for further studies and targeted interventions.""

**Clinician perceptions may explain prescribing disparities**

Hospitalization rates were high in both groups, with 76.5% of influenza A patients and 70.8% of type B patients requiring admission. The average length of stay was 11 days for influenza A and 12 days for influenza B.

Influenza A and B patients had similar death rates by 90 days (13.4% vs 8.7%, respectively) and proportions of radiologic lung abnormalities (27.8% vs 24.8%), but those with type A were more likely to receive oseltamivir (43.5% vs 27.9% for type B).

""This may reflect clinicians' perception of greater severity in influenza A, as supported by previous studies, given its higher circulation,"" the researchers said of the oseltamivir prescribing disparities. ""However, given the comparable ICU [intensive care unit] admission and mortality rates between influenza A and B, our findings suggest that oseltamivir could also benefit influenza B patients, particularly those with severe disease or risk factors for complications."" 

**Type B disease burden may be greater than believed**

Older age (65 years and older) was the strongest risk factor for hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.78), while older age (aOR, 3.18), bilateral pulmonary involvement (aOR, 19.4), and receipt of osteltamivir (aOR, 2.43) were risk factors for ICU admission, with a trend toward coinfection with a bacterial pathogen requiring antibiotics (aOR, 2.56).

In the short-term, influenza B patients had more favorable outcomes (aOR, 2.52), but chronic respiratory disease and higher scores on the Charlson Comorbidity Index lessened the odds of these outcomes (aOR, 0.34).

""While influenza B patients experienced better short-term (≤5 days) outcomes, **overall they experienced more hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mortality than expected,"" the study authors wrote.** ""Indeed, despite the fact that influenza B has historically received less attention due to the dominance of influenza A pandemics, recent surveillance suggests that its disease burden may be greater than previously recognized, warranting increased focus in the post-COVID era.""

The findings highlight the need for earlier diagnostic tests and more equitable oseltamivir prescribing, the importance of managing coinfections, and broader vaccination policies tailored to both influenza types, they added.",1j4coqu,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/report-influenza-and-b-clinically-different-and-type-b-patients-less-likely,85

""There are days that we have no memory of. We were in this blacked out room for a very long time and the doctor came, every day. We were so sick. There was a pail in our bedroom to go to the washroom,"" said McCourbrey, now 64 and still living in rural Elgin County as she did when she was a child with measles. 

""I remember the first time I was able to leave the room to go to the bathroom and when they opened the curtains in the bedroom. We were quite weak."" Children with measles were kept in dark rooms because it was thought that exposure to light while sick could cause blindness, she said.

McCoubrey and her older sister were five and six years old when they got measles. It was sometime between 1965 and 1967, and a very scary time for the girls' mother. ""She said it was an absolutely horrifying time."" 

Now, McCoubrey is watching with horror as the disease, largely preventable with vaccinations, is spreading in her community, 60 years later. 

In the region covered by Southwestern Public Health, which includes Aylmer, St. Thomas and Tillsonburg, public health says:

115 cases of measles since October
10 people hospitalized
Three-quarters of infections in children

Majority of people infected unvaccinated
For months, the health authority has been urging people to get vaccinated and has warned of possible exposures, usually at walk-in clinics or hospitals where people with measles show up for treatment.

A recent exposure happened at the East Elgin Community Centre, a recreational complex in Aylmer, where a children's hockey tournament took place. [...] 

Measles has been on the minds of those living in and around the region, said Rob Angione, the principal at Immanuel Christian School in Aylmer. 

""It's definitely something that we talk about and that we're monitoring,"" he said. ""Thankfully, we have not had any cases here but we're a small community of 57 families, so there's a lot of communication going on."" [...] 

The Church of God in Aylmer has closed its school to prevent measles from spreading, a person who answered the phone at the school said. Pastor Henry Hildebrandt did not return calls or emails asking for more information. 

McCoubrey, who remembers the agony of the virus, has recently gotten a booster shot. 

""These things are coming back because people won't vaccinate. That's just not right because so many people cannot get the vaccination because they're immuno-compromised or pregnant.

The U.N. agency pointed to a 4.5-times increase in reported measles cases this year across North and South America, compared to the same period last year.

More than 97% of cases across the region so far this year have been in the U.S. or Canada. Cases have also been reported in Mexico and Argentina.

""The risk of outbreaks has increased, given the increase in measles cases worldwide, coupled with factors such as low coverage of the first and second doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,"" PAHO, the World Health Organization's regional office for the Americas, said in a report published last week.

Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms. 

What is measles elimination?

The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.

Health officials define ""measles elimination"" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.  [...]

The agency posted on X that it’s partnering with the Texas Department of State Health Services.

“This partnership - known as an Epi-Aid- is a rapid response by CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) to tackle urgent public health issues like disease outbreaks. EIS officers provide local officials onsite support for 1-3 weeks, aiding in quick decision-making to control health threats. The local authority leads the investigation while collaborating with CDC experts,” the post said.

Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described delivering vitamin A and providing ambulance assistance from Gaines County, the West Texas county that has seen the highest number of cases. He also described treatments with a steroid, budesonide and an antibiotic, clarithromycin, and cod liver oil.

The CDC has previously provided lab support and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines to Texas. Kennedy did not mention vaccines during the portion of the interview aired on Fox.

“What we’re trying to do is really to restore faith in government and to make sure that we are there to help them with their needs, and not particularly to dictate what they ought to be doing,” Kennedy said.

“We’re going to be honest with the American people for the first time in history about what actually about all of the tests and all the studies, what we know, what we don’t know, we’re going to tell them, and that’s going to anger some people who want you know an ideological approach to public health.”

In an update on Friday, Texas reported 146 measles cases, including 20 hospitalized patients. Last week, Texas announced the first death in the outbreak, a school-age child who was not vaccinated.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741098989.0,"Cows, cats and rats: Why H5N1 spreading to more species is so worrisome","With egg prices spiking due to bird flu, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced steps last week to control the H5N1 virus, such as increasing financial relief for farmers with affected flocks and exploring vaccines and therapeutics for chickens. While these steps might help stabilize the egg supply in the short term, they’re insufficient for one simple reason: Chickens are not the only animals affected by this disease.

Three other species — cows, cats and rats — show why the Trump administration needs a more comprehensive strategy to protect the public.
Let’s start with cows, which have already been battling H5N1 for about a year. Nearly 980 dairy herds in 17 states have been affected. Stacey Schultz-Cherry, an influenza expert at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, told me scientists were “quite shocked” when the spillover first happened from birds to cows. Many thought it would be a one-off event, with subsequent transmissions of that strain of bird flu, called B3.13, happening between cows themselves.

Now, it appears the cross-species spillover has occurred at least two more times. Another strain of the virus — D1.1, which has been spreading among poultry — was identified in dairy herds in Nevada and Arizona this month. This means even if transmission among cows were curbed, they could continue to get sick from birds.

Moreover, the D1.1 strain is concerning because it was found in two people who fell severely ill during this outbreak. One person, a teenager, required intensive care for multi-organ failure; the other died. It’s not known if this strain causes more severe disease in humans, but its detection in cows should increase urgency to test dairy workers.

Cats, too, have long been susceptible to H5N1 infection. In past outbreaks, they contracted the virus primarily from eating dead and dying birds. In this one, they also appear to have contracted H5N1 through contaminated raw milk and raw pet food.

Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report suggesting that two dairy workers in Michigan transmitted bird flu to their pet cats. Both were indoor cats that did not consume raw milk or food. One developed lethargy, an unsteady gait and other neurological symptoms. After four days, it needed to be euthanized. The other cat, which lived in a separate household, developed neurological symptoms and died within a day. Both tested positive for bird flu postmortem.

In both cases, the owners had occupational exposures to the virus and reported symptoms that preceded their cats’ illness. Because both declined testing, scientists cannot definitively say that the cats contracted the virus from the workers, but it seems likely.

If cats could contract H5N1 from humans, could the reverse be true, too? This has been documented in the past, said Kristen K. Coleman, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. **She cited a 2004 bird flu outbreak in a Thailand tiger breeding facility in which human workers contracted the virus. A spillover from cats to humans “could spark a human pandemic,” she said.**

Finally, the rats. In late January, the Agriculture Department added the black rat to the list of mammals known to have bird flu. Coleman says this species heightens her unease as it is smaller and cats “frequently and readily prey on” it. If cats eat infected rats, they could get H5N1 and spread it to one another and to other species. The black rat’s mobility between farm and urban areas could also speed up the virus’s already high rate of species spillover.

Meghan Frost Davis, a veterinarian and Johns Hopkins professor, has been warning for months that rodents contracting H5N1 would be a major red flag in the evolution of bird flu. **“What we really need to understand is to what degree rodents are involved,”** she said, so that containment can be more targeted and more precise. She also urges better surveillance and data reporting of companion animal infections and more education of veterinary workers so that they are looking for bird flu across species and aware of their own risk.

Every expert I spoke to this for this column — and indeed for every piece I’ve written on bird flu — emphasized the urgent need for rapid, accessible testing. As Schultz-Cherry said, “We need to find ways to test anybody and everybody that has a potential occupational exposure — and their households.” Clinicians treating high-risk workers should have rapid antigen tests, as should veterinarians.

Thus far, 70 people have tested positive for H5N1. Americans need to be ready for when that number multiplies. The Biden administration had taken steps to expedite vaccine development, including by investing $590 million in Moderna’s mRNA technology for a bird flu vaccine. The Trump administration has said it might withdraw this funding.

Doing so would be a profound mistake. As bird flu affects more and more species, containment efforts alone are not enough. The administration must also prepare for H5N1 potentially becoming a significant threat to human health.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741039822.0,US health official quits after reported clashes with RFK Jr over measles,"Tom Corry, a top spokesperson at the health and human services department, abruptly resigned on Friday

“I want to announce to my friends and colleagues that last Friday I announced my resignation effective immediately,” Corry, who previously served in a similar role in the first Trump administration, wrote on LinkedIn. “To my colleagues at HHS, I wish you the best and great success.”

Corry, who was sworn in just two weeks ago, did not provide a reason for his departure, and HHS did not respond for a request for comment.

Last month, Corry had said that he was “thankful” to be a part of the team “that is going to work to make America healthy again, and on making healthcare more affordable and accessible”.

But on Monday, two people familiar with the matter told Politico that Corry had been clashing with the HHS secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, along with his close aides, regarding the management of the health department amid the escalating measles outbreak.

The sources indicated that Corry had become increasingly uneasy with Kennedy’s “muted response” to the intensifying outbreak of measles in Texas, where more than 140 people have become infected since January.

The outbreak has also resulted in the death of an unvaccinated child, marking the first fatality from the highly contagious disease in the US since 2015. [...] 

Then, on Sunday, two days after Corry’s resignation, Kennedy published an opinion piece in Fox News, expressing his concerns about the disease’s spread.

In the piece, the prominent vaccine skeptic adopted a different stance from his previous remarks, and said that “vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons”.

However, he stopped short of directly calling for vaccinations, instead suggesting that the vaccines should be “readily accessible for all those who want them”.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741015180.0,"Amid West Texas measles outbreak, vaccine resistance hardens","SEMINOLE, Texas — When the local hospital warned of a brewing measles outbreak, Kaleigh Brantner urged fellow residents of this rural West Texas community to beware of vaccinating their children.
Two weeks later, her unvaccinated 7-year-old son came home from school with a fever. The telltale rash across his body followed. But his mild symptoms and swift recovery only hardened Brantner’s anti-vaccination convictions, even after an unvaccinated child died of measles at a hospital 80 miles away.

“We’re not going to harm our children or [risk] the potential to harm our children,” she said, “so that we can save yours.” [...] 

The life-threatening outbreak in West Texas starkly illustrates the stakes of slipping immunization rates and the ascension of vaccine skeptics, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to the highest levels of the public health establishment.

And it has revealed how fear and the scientifically false claims of the anti-vaccine movement have seeped into communities such as Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, hardening attitudes about vaccines, pro and con, in the face of a dangerous, preventable disease.

Brantner, 34, said she decided not to vaccinate her children after years of her own research and because, she said, her nephew had a severe reaction to the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. She moved from New Mexico to Texas in part because it’s easier here to claim an exception to school vaccine mandates.

“A cough, runny nose, fever and rash to a healthy child is mild but vaccine adverse reactions are severe!!!” she commented on Jan. 30 on the local hospital’s Facebook post, which described measles symptoms.

Brantner’s son Paxton recovered from measles with little problem, she said, after she fed him organic food and cod liver oil, bathed him in magnesium salts and rubbed him in beef tallow cream infused with lavender. The family took precautions to protect others in the community, such as ordering groceries for pickup and keeping their older son out of school. He developed a measles rash Friday. [...] 

But the outbreak is no longer concentrated just in that group. It has infected people like the Brantner family, who are not Mennonites, spread across nine West Texas counties and crossed the border into New Mexico.

The outbreak spurred hundreds in the region to vaccinate themselves and their children as the threat of the virus became immediate. But it has made others dig in their heels, arguing that measles is no worse than chicken pox or the flu. [...] 

Still, some living with the outbreak argue that it is a good thing: Girls can grow up and pass antibodies to their children to shore up protection in infancy, while infected children gain lifelong immunity.
But doctors warn that comes at a cost.

“They could have had that same immunity with the vaccine,” said Tammy Camp, a Lubbock pediatrician who oversees doctors who cared for the child who died. “And, unfortunately, there’s a child who paid a very heavy price for that.”

In an op-ed published Sunday on the Fox News website, Kennedy called on parents to discuss measles shots with their health-care providers.
“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” Kennedy wrote. “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.”
Because Gaines County has no movie theater, limited health-care options and few big-box stores, people travel to cities more than an hour away for entertainment, shopping and advanced medical care — creating opportunities for the virus to spread through new pockets of unvaccinated people.

Measles outbreaks often link back to tightly knit groups with below-average vaccination rates, even if the majority of the community is immunized. In 2017, measles tore through a Somali community in the Minneapolis area, infecting more than 70. The next year, a measles outbreak in New York City infected more than 600 Orthodox Jews.

Disease detectives are seeing similar conditions among the West Texas Mennonites.

**Anti-vaccine views harden**

Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, recently visited Siemens at the museum she runs to share a medical journal article about the four months it took to end a measles outbreak in an Amish community in Ohio in 2014.

Some Mennonites have faulted him for singling out their community, but Holbrooks said he is just trying to provide information about the burgeoning risk.

Holbrooks worries that younger generations do not understand the danger of measles that he and his staff are now seeing. At a testing site outside the hospital, a mother showed up with a baby with blue lips — a sign the infant was struggling to breathe.
“That has haunted me,” Holbrooks said. “That would be the impetus for me to do everything I can to get the message out about measles vaccine.”

Vaccines can be a victim of their own success. When diseases vanish, the memory of their dangers and the urgency to eradicate them fade.

Marina Tovar brought her 15-month-old daughter Kambrey to be vaccinated at the Lubbock Health Department after Sunday church services. She had already planned to vaccinate her daughter when the family’s insurance plan restarted, but sped up her plans after reading about the outbreak.

On a morning last week at a Mennonite-owned pizzeria, a Mennonite couple told a waitress that their 16-year-old son’s recent bout of measles was minor. “It was a rough couple of days, but nothing worse than a flu,” the father, Peter, said.

In an interview, the couple said they view childhood vaccination as tantamount to Russian roulette because of the risk of side effects. They spoke on the condition that their last names not be published because, they said, local Mennonites have been harassed and ostracized since the outbreak began.

The couple said those who choose not to vaccinate children are unfairly vilified. They said they protected the community by keeping their son and his older siblings home after he tested positive for measles.
“Some people have it really bad but most people don’t, just like with the vaccine,” said Mary, the mother. “Where there is risk, there should be choice.”

Experts say the choice not to immunize has consequences for the community, even when people experience mild illness and isolate once sick. People infected with measles can transmit the virus four days before the rash appears. Infants are too young to be vaccinated.

Still, some here believe the vaccines themselves are responsible for the rapid spread of the virus. They repeated false claims from anti-vaccine activists outside Texas who blamed free vaccine clinics launched in the early days of the outbreak for accelerating infections.

They have seized on a handful of measles cases in vaccinated patients (five out of 146, with vaccination status unknown for 62, according to state data) to argue that the unvaccinated are not to blame. But epidemiologists say it’s not surprising that occasional infections will occur among vaccinated people when an outbreak is rapidly growing.

Ben Edwards, a physician in Lubbock who treats some patients in Seminole, including a family with measles, recently released an episode of his podcast about the outbreak, in which he described mass infection as “God’s version of measles immunization.”

Edwards said the ideal treatment for measles is not all that dissimilar from other infectious diseases. His advice for patients is to undergo a “mitochondrial tune-up” to strengthen their immune response.

“Go get a green juice, or just drink some water with a pinch of sea salt and go sit outside and listen to a bird chirp,” Edwards said. “It sounds crazy, but it’s the basics. It’s what our ancestors knew.”

His views stand in stark contrast with the pleas of those on the front lines of the outbreak to get vaccinated. All 20 confirmed measles patients treated at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said.

Summer Davies, a pediatric hospitalist, has cared for about half of them, including the one who died.
“This is a disease they didn’t have to get if they had adequate vaccination or if we had adequate herd immunity,” Davies said. “Knowing there was a way to prevent it is the heartbreaking part

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1741028756.0,Recent Virus Research Should Raise Alarm,"There’s a central question that many scientists face: How can scientific discoveries drive humanity’s progress without posing a dire risk to it? As virus experts, we’re committed to research that uncovers pandemic threats and helps protect people from them. But we are concerned about how some scientists are experimenting with viruses in ways that could put all of us in harm’s way.

In a study published in the scientific journal Cell, a group of researchers reported the discovery of a coronavirus in bats that has the potential to spread to humans.

In a series of experiments, the scientists show that this virus, HKU5-CoV-2, can efficiently infect cells of humans and a wide range of other animal cells. The findings raise the possibility that humans and other animals could be infected by this virus. This coronavirus belongs to a subgroup of viruses that are classified alongside the one that causes MERS and that can have fatality rates far higher than that of the virus that caused the Covid pandemic.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology, where many of the researchers work or have worked, is at the center of the controversy regarding the origin of the Covid pandemic. We do not imply that the institute is responsible for the Covid pandemic, nor do we have any certainty that this newly discovered virus has the potential to cause the next one. **What worries us is the insufficient safety precautions the researchers took when studying this coronavirus.**

Research laboratories have different levels of security, based on its categorization on a biosafety level scale, from BSL-1, the lowest, to BSL-4. Lower-security labs are used for studying infectious agents that either don’t cause disease in people or pose only moderate risk. The higher-security laboratories are for studying pathogens that can spread in the air and have the potential to cause lethal infections.

BSL-4 labs are the ones featured in movies where scientists walk around in what look like spacesuits with air hoses and shower in decontamination chambers when their work is done. BSL-3 labs limit access to specifically trained staff members, have locking double doors for enhanced security and specific air handling and sterilization systems. Workers wear head-to-toe personal protective equipment and are under medical surveillance for signs of laboratory-acquired infection that could pose a risk to others.

Decisions about what level of precaution is appropriate for research are typically made by a study’s lead scientist and an institutional biosafety committee that includes scientists, physicians, administrators and members of the local community.

The researchers behind the Cell paper began by studying the new virus in ways that do not require growing live virus — like through computer analysis. But after establishing that the virus can probably infect human cells, the researchers performed experiments with the fully infectious virus. They did not conduct these experiments in a BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratory but in a laboratory described as BSL-2 plus, a designation that is not standardized and not formally recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and that we think is insufficient for work with potentially dangerous respiratory viruses.

This work was apparently approved by the local institutional biosafety committee and adhered to national biosafety standards. But it is not sufficient for work with a new virus that could have significant risks for people worldwide.


Herein lies a crucial problem that the world must address. Scientists and policymakers in the United States have spent years discussing and debating how to regulate risky virus research, sometimes contentiously. But this work happens in other countries, too — and not all countries approach questions about the safety of this work in the same way. So one country’s decisions about how to approach studying risky pathogens can go only so far.

Wherever in the world it happens, work with viruses that have the potential to become threats to public health should be restricted to facilities and scientists committed to the highest level of safety. As the leading international public health agency, the World Health Organization should take the lead in rigorously clarifying these standards. But we need other mechanisms to ensure that researchers worldwide follow the rules. Agencies inside and outside government that fund this sort of work should require proof that investigators meet global standards. Scientific journals should have similar standards for the studies they accept.

Last week was the 50th anniversary of the 1975 Asilomar Summit, where scientists came together to establish guidelines for research with genetically modified microbes. Today many more discoveries and threats are on the horizon. Potentially dangerous research should not be done without proper precautions to prevent deliberate or accidental spread.

Good news: We’re getting a break from “influenza-like illnesses” (fever, cough, sore throat), which continue to decline—typical as the weather warms up. The Northeast still has very high levels.

A rare flu complication that impacts the brain—influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE)—has increased this year, accounting for 13% of flu-related deaths (9 out of 68). We don’t yet know why it’s increasing, but it highlights the importance of flu vaccination in kids and the use of antivirals.

Meanwhile, Covid-19 metrics have been declining for a few weeks but are now stalling. With a mild winter and flu on the downturn, I’m watching closely to see if Covid-19 makes a spring comeback.

Last week, CDC published flu vaccine effectiveness data, and it’s looking good: 36-54%. The range is due to a combination of different data systems and one strain circulating that is notoriously hard to target with vaccines.

**Other viral outbreaks in the past week**

The latest count in West Texas measles outbreak is 146 cases. Twenty children have been hospitalized, some in intensive care. None were vaccinated. Texas’s case curve looks like it’s slowing, but it’s unclear if that’s due to control efforts or data/reporting challenges.

Other measles cases are popping up in Kentucky, Austin, Houston, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Pennsylvania. All are from international travel and have not resulted in outbreaks (3+ cases) yet.

A rubella case was reported in Texas (San Antonio). This vaccine-preventable disease can be devastating to pregnant women. Since we eliminated it in the U.S., it’s very rare—there were only 38 cases total from 2016 to 2022. Rubella, the “R” in the MMR vaccine, is caused by a virus that spreads from coughing or sneezing in airborne droplets.

In Ohio, a farm worker became infected with H5N1 after coming into contact with dead poultry. The virus jumping from a bird to a human shouldn’t be too surprising, given that Ohio had to cull 10 million birds due to mass infections. The risk to the general public is still low.

On our policy watch radar: Utah could soon ban fluoride in drinking water. The legislature is waiting on the governor’s signature. Fluoride in drinking water has beneficial effects, particularly in underserved areas. (Check out the YLE deep dive on this topic.) Utah would join Hawaii, which has already banned fluoride in drinking water.

**VRBPAC meeting canceled—here’s why that matters**

Speaking of vaccine policy, FDA’s VRBPAC meeting originally scheduled for March 13 has been canceled under the direction of HHS Secretary Kennedy.

While ACIP is CDC’s external vaccine advisory committee, VRBPAC is the FDA’s. This meeting is important because it would have determined the fall 2025 flu vaccine formula—a decision that must be made now since manufacturers require about 6 months to develop the vaccines. 

What does this mean to you? Not much. **This doesn’t mean there won’t be a flu vaccine this fall. The FDA and vaccine manufacturers will likely follow WHO’s formula recommendation (set last week). The U.S. rarely deviates from WHO.**

That said, it’s ironic that the administration is pulling the U.S. out of WHO and has little communication with the agency, yet it is still deciding to depend on WHO’s guidance. 

Delaying VRBPAC’s meeting raises two other concerns:Reduces transparency on options and decision points. These organizations have consistently been the voice of wisdom, providing clear, unbiased decision-making around vaccine policy.

Destabilizes insurance coverage. There is uncertainty about where to go next with vaccines, and without insurance coverage, there is less motivation to produce vaccines.

The strategy for flu vaccine development is now unclear. The ripple effects of these decisions could be significant in the long run.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740923816.0,Indonesia’s Bali warns tourists of rabies risk after local death from dog bite,"Indonesia's holiday hotspot Bali has warned tourists of the risks of rabies after a local man died of the disease this week. The patient, 35, succumbed on Monday [24 Feb 2025] after displaying symptoms including restlessness and high fever, local media reported.

He was found to have been bitten by a stray dog 6 months ago in Sukasada, a town 2 hours' drive from the island capital of Denpasar, according to the English-language news outlet Bali Sun. Instead of reporting the bite to authorities, the man had only washed his wound. But he began to show symptoms on Saturday [22 Feb 2025] and died 2 days later.

""We have carried out treatment, but the symptoms shown by the patient are indeed very typical of rabies,"" said Putu Nugraha, director of Buleleng Regional Hospital, where the victim was pronounced dead. Nugraha pointed out that a post-bite vaccination against the disease was not given since the man did not report his injury.

According to guidelines from the Bali provincial government, individuals should immediately visit a hospital to receive the anti-rabies vaccine if bitten by an animal suspected of carrying the virus. Dog scratches and bites account for the largest number of rabies infections in humans, according to the World Health Organization.

The incubation period of the disease usually ranges from 2 to 3 months but could vary from weeks to a year. Once symptoms manifest, rabies is virtually 100% fatal, according to the WHO. Rabies deaths are preventable with swift post-exposure vaccination to stop the virus from reaching the central nervous system.

Bali reported its first rabies fatality in 2008 and the disease has since become endemic on the island, partly attributed to the large number of stray dogs, a study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN showed. Authorities first relied on culling to control the spread, but to little effect, and by the mid-2010s, infections were reported across the island. The policy later shifted to mass vaccination of free-roaming dogs, which brought the disease under control with FAO's help.

As of 19 Feb 2025, animal health authorities in Denpasar had vaccinated 2266 dogs in the urban area this year, according to Bali Sun. But the number only accounted for less than 3% of the total, with authorities aiming to vaccinate 91% of the known dog population or around 74 000 canines.

**Seven fatal rabies cases were reported on the island last year [2024], from nearly 56 000 rabies bites, local media said in January [2025].** The toll was a decline from the previous year [2023], according to the Detik news website, citing authorities in Bali. **Many people were still reluctant to report bites to authorities, as they believed their pet dogs did not carry the virus, he said.**

Bali is a popular tourist destination among international travellers. Over 6.3 million foreigners visited the island last year [2024], according to government data.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740880214.0,She Felt Fine. So Why Had She Lost So Much Weight?,"The 67-year-old woman slipped off her shoes before stepping onto her doctor’s scale. At her home, in Maplewood, N.J., the bathroom scale had documented the same 25-pound weight loss she and her internist now saw. It happened suddenly, over the past few months. Initially she blamed a bout of Covid-19 that she picked up during a trip with friends to Morocco three months earlier. But that seemed unlikely: The illness felt like no more than a bad cold and lasted only one week.

It wasn’t as if she were wasting away, and she rather liked the way she looked at this new weight. Still, she hadn’t been dieting, so it worried her. Just a few weeks earlier, a friend lost weight unintentionally like this and was diagnosed with metastatic cancer.
By the time she got to this appointment with her primary-care doctor, the woman, an emergency-room physician, had already done some investigating. 

She saw her ob-gyn, who gave her the all-clear. A recent colonoscopy and mammogram were normal. Still, she wanted to hear what her internist, Dr. James Rommer, would make of her unintended weight loss.
Rommer had known the woman for many years. He saw her before her left-knee replacement surgery the previous year; not long afterward, she called to tell him that her blood pressure was high. He started her on a blood-pressure medication and had increased it at each of her follow-up visits.

She didn’t feel sick, the patient told Rommer. She had no nausea, no stomach pain. Her appetite was good. Maybe she was a little more tired than usual, but that could be left over from the holidays, she said.

Her blood pressure was elevated but otherwise her exam was normal. Rommer agreed the weight loss was concerning; patients don’t usually lose weight by accident. He outlined his plan: For the weight loss, he would order some basic lab tests — blood count, chemistries, liver and thyroid studies. And for her new and persistent high blood pressure, he would look for a couple of unusual tumors that can raise blood pressure by putting out excessive cortisol or epinephrine, the fight-or-flight hormones made by the adrenal glands. If all that was normal, he would get a CT scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis to make sure he wasn’t missing anything. 

**A Life-Threatening Deficiency**
The patient was at the gym the next morning when her phone rang. Rommer’s voice was grave as he explained the unexpected finding from her lab tests. Her liver and kidney results and blood counts had been normal. But her cortisol, which Rommer had thought might be elevated, was practically undetectable. That could be dangerous. He asked if she felt safe to drive.

Cortisol is one of the body’s most powerful stress hormones. It acts on nearly every organ in the body, helping to maintain normal function after episodes of physiological stress such as illness or surgery. When the body is unable to produce adequate amounts of cortisol, recovery from any type of stress can be difficult and sometimes impossible. Deficiencies of the hormone can be life-threatening. [...] 

Nevin greeted the patient cheerfully. First order of business, she told the patient, was to double check the abnormal lab result. Again the woman’s cortisol level was dangerously low. Another hormone, called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which triggers the release of cortisol, was also low. They would have to figure out why these two hormones were so out of whack, and the patient would have to be started on daily doses of hydrocortisone to replace the cortisol her body wasn’t making in adequate amounts.

But before starting treatment, it was important to find out if the cortisol was low because the adrenal gland simply wasn’t making it or if it was because of the low ACTH. The patient was given an injection of ACTH, which should prompt the adrenal glands to release very high levels of cortisol. An hour later the cortisol level was higher, but still not as high as it should be. That suggested that both the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland, which makes ACTH, were not working properly.

Nevin sent off tests to see if other pituitary or adrenal hormones were affected. They weren’t. She also looked for the most common causes of these kinds of disorders. Was this some type of autoimmune issue? She sent tests to look for the kinds of autoantibodies known to attack these parts of the body. All negative. There were diseases that could affect the adrenal or pituitary glands: H.I.V., tuberculosis and tumors that, because of their size or their unregulated secretion of hormones, might disrupt those organs’ function. Dozens of tubes of blood were filled and sent off to a variety of labs. She had none of the disorders that could cause this dramatic drop.

An M.R.I. of the brain showed a tumor on the pituitary, but it was tiny. Further testing showed it wasn’t producing any hormones at all. It was what is known as an incidentaloma, too small and inert be the cause of her symptoms.

**The Medicine Works**

Nevin was puzzled. She had seen her share of patients with adrenal insufficiency. They looked sick: tired and listless with weak and painful muscles; their blood pressure was sometimes so low they could hardly stand up. None of that was true for this patient. She looked physically fit. Her blood pressure was high, not low. It was true that she had lost weight, but the overall picture didn’t fit. Still, she believed the lab results.

She scanned the literature for other possible causes of her patient’s sluggish glands. She found a couple of case reports of patients who developed adrenal insufficiency after a Covid-19 infection. Could the patient’s bout with Covid a few months earlier be the culprit? The timing was right, but there was no way to tell at this point.

The patient did well on the twice daily hydrocortisone treatment. She started regaining her lost weight, and her mild fatigue subsided. She asked the doctor if she was going to have to be on this medication forever. Nevin told her that she probably would. At least that was true for most patients with adrenal insufficiency.

After two weeks on the hydrocortisone, the patient started having trouble sleeping. She reduced the dose and suddenly she could sleep again. When the sleeplessness returned a few weeks later, she cut the dose again. All this occurred nearly a year ago. The patient continues to take a small dose of the hydrocortisone every day. Strangely, her high blood pressure improved, and she was able to stop the hypertension medications. Nevin tells me she still doesn’t understand why.

Nor did Nevin understand why this patient was not as sick as most who have adrenal insufficiency. Her hypothesis is that the deficiency was discovered early. Because the symptoms are vague, patients with critically low stress-hormone levels can elude diagnosis for months, sometimes years.

**A few months after this diagnosis, a newly published study showed that 14 percent of people with Covid-19 developed adrenal insufficiency that often improved on its own over time.** As with so much about this virus, why the deficiency occurs, or why it resolves, is still not well understood.

While there is no way to know for certain if it was the Covid infection that caused the patient’s adrenal insufficiency, both she and Nevin, inspired by the recent study, plan to try to get her off the medication sometime this year. It will be a slow process — but from the patient’s perspective, totally worth it.

State officials told TPR they have not confirmed a case of either type of illness at the school.

Legacy Traditional School - Cibolo said in a statement provided to TPR around 6:30 Thursday evening that the school was ""taking all necessary precautions following the confirmation of a measles case in a first-grade classroom.""

The statement was provided by the charter school's management company, Vertex Education. However, a letter that appears to have been sent to parents used the terms measles and rubella interchangeably. Rubella is sometimes called German measles, but it is not the same illness.

TPR contacted Sean Amir with the charter management company seeking clarification, and Amir told TPR the case was actually rubella.

Rubella doesn't typically make kids as sick as measles can, but it poses a threat to women in the first trimester of pregnancy. It can cause miscarriage or stillbirth.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740839845.0,Kennedy Jr backtracks and says US measles outbreak is now a ‘top priority’ for health department,"Two days after initially downplaying the outbreak as “not unusual,” the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, on Friday said he recognizes the serious impact of the ongoing measles epidemic in Texas – in which a child died recently – and said the government is providing resources, including protective vaccines.

“Ending the measles outbreak is a top priority for me and my extraordinary team,” Kennedy – an avowed anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who for years has sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines – said in a post on X.

Kennedy said his federal Department of Health and Human Services would send Texas 2,000 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine – typically meant to be given to children in a series of two shots at 12 to 15 months old as well as between the ages of four and six years old – through its immunization program.

Earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upheld the role of vaccines in offering protection against measles after an unvaccinated child died from an infection this week. The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in Texas since late January.

The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.

Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.

A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from the CDC showed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.

These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.

**Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions** – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.

The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.

Kennedy paused a multimillion-dollar project to create a new Covid-19 vaccine in pill form on Tuesday, and the Food and Drug Administration canceled an advisory committee meeting on updating next season’s flu vaccine, an advisory committee said Wednesday.

The Covid project was a $460 million contract with Vaxart to develop a new Covid vaccine in pill form, with 10,000 people scheduled to begin clinical trials on Monday. Of that, $240 million was reportedly already authorized for the preliminary study.

“While it is crucial that the Department [of] Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production, including Vaxart’s,” Kennedy said, according to Fox News. [...] 

Meanwhile, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, was scheduled to meet in March to discuss the strains that would be included in next season’s flu shot, but federal officials told the committee in an email Wednesday that the meeting was canceled, said committee member Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit told NBC News that no explanation was given for the cancellation of the yearly spring meeting, which comes in the middle of a flu season in which 86 children and 19,000 adults have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In an email to NBC, Norman Baylor, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccine Research and Review, said, “I’m quite shocked. As you know, the VRBPAC is critical for making the decision on strain selection for the next influenza vaccine season.” Last week, an upcoming CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was also postponed.  [...] 

These moves send a disturbing message that Kennedy’s anti-vaccine views are starting to influence health policy. On Wednesday, the secretary already had an alarming, nonchalant response to the first American measles death in a decade. Now it seems American public health efforts could experience a serious setback as long as President Trump and Kennedy are in government.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740751327.0,"As the Texas outbreak grows, how contagious is measles, really?","[...] Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 children used to die from it each year.

But the vaccine's power to beat back measles outbreaks starts to crumble when vaccination rates drop low enough. We asked scientists to help us decipher how lower vaccination rates can affect spread and what that means for the current outbreak.

**The math of measles spread**

To understand just how easily measles spreads, it helps to know a scientific concept known as the basic reproduction number, or R naught. That's the number of people, on average, that a single infected person can transmit a disease to.

The R naught for measles ranges from 12 to 18. In other words, if one person is infected, they will infect as many as 18 others on average. That's much higher than with other infectious diseases, such as Ebola with an R naught of 2.

However, R naught is a theoretical number. ""It's not some magical constant,"" says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.

It assumes that no one has immunity to a given disease. That's what the ""naught"" refers to, as in zero immunity. It's useful for comparing the infectious potential of different diseases. But in the real world, a lot of different factors can alter how easily measles transmits.

This brings us to a concept known as the effective reproduction number. That's the number of people that a sick person can infect in a given population at any specific time. It changes as more people become immune through infection or vaccination.

It also changes depending on how people behave. Do infected people isolate? Are vulnerable, unvaccinated people clustered together, socializing with each other? That kind of situation ""gives an opportunity for the virus to exist in a place,"" Lessler says.

And, the most effective firewall against transmission is vaccination. [...] 

If a disease has a reproduction number under 1, infections will spread slowly and an outbreak will eventually die out, because each infected person spreads it to fewer than one other person on average.

On the flipside, here's where exponential case growth can happen. Let's say a measles outbreak has an effective reproduction number of 3, like in the graphic above. That might not sound so bad, until you consider that those three people can go on to infect three others, and so on and so on.

In fact, the original strain of the virus that causes COVID had a reproduction number of around 3, and we all saw how that went, says Matt Ferrari, a professor of biology and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University.

""It's not unreasonable to think that measles could spread as fast as [pre-vaccine] SARS-CoV-2 in populations, particularly in school settings, where kids are vaccinated at 80-85%,"" Ferrari says. [...] 

Lessler says many factors will determine how far this outbreak spreads and how big it gets. That includes how many people get vaccinated in response to the outbreak, whether suspected cases are quarantined, and how well contact tracing works so exposed people don't infect others.

And that's critical, because a person infected with measles can be contagious from four days before the telltale measles rash appears, until four days after, says Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas.

""So you can be spreading it without knowing you have the measles,"" Carreno says. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left the room. ""That's what makes it also difficult to control."" [...] 

""Are we at risk of getting, like in the old days, thousands or tens of thousands of cases from this outbreak? That's probably pretty unlikely,"" Lessler says. ""The [vaccination] firewall is still pretty strong at that sort of broad level.""

But if measles vaccination rates continue their downward trend amid rising anti-vaccine sentiment, he says the days when measles outbreaks involve thousands of cases could return within the next five to 10 years.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740775854.0,WHO advisers swap out H3N2 strains for next Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines,"The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced its advisory committee’s recommendations on strains to include for the Northern Hemisphere’s 2025-26 flu season, which swap out the H3N2 components but keep the current 2009 H1N1 and influenza B strains the same.

The three strains recommended for the trivalent vaccine are also the same as those recommended for the Southern Hemisphere’s 2025 season vaccine, which the group weighed in on at its meetings in September 2024. 

Today’s recommendations have separate H3N2 recommendations for egg-based and cell-based flu vaccines. Though the WHO recommends trivalent vaccines, some companies include a second influenza B strain targeting both lineages. The Yamagata lineage hasn’t circulated since 2020, and the recommendation for that strain remains the same as for previous seasons.

**H3N2 pick often a challenge**

At a WHO briefing today, Ian Barr, PhD, deputy director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, said the H3N2 pick is always a challenge, because it changes more quickly than the other strains. “It’s always the bane of our existence.” He added that this season’s H3N2 vaccine strain for the Northern Hemisphere didn’t turn out to be a perfect match but has been a reasonable one. 

The severe flu season under way in the United States has come with a higher proportion of H3N2 activity than in other regions of the world such as Europe and China, where H1N1 has been predominant, Barr said. South America has seen a mix of H1N1 and influenza B, while Australia—like the United States—is experiencing a mix of H3N2 and H1N1.

Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, WHO’s director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) participated actively in this week’s strain selection meeting and that the United States has been sharing genetic sequences from both people and animals. 

Country regulatory authorities and flu vaccine manufacturers take the WHO recommendations into account when starting the 6-month process for making the next season’s flu vaccines.

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has cancelled a March 13 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory meeting to weigh in on the flu vaccine strain picks. However, HHS officials said the FDA would make its recommendations in time for manufacturers to update the vaccines for the next flu season.

**Two new picks for pandemic preparedness**

In its twice-yearly flu vaccine strain consultations, the WHO advisers also comb through the latest zoonotic flu strains to see if any new candidate vaccine viruses are needed for pandemic preparedness.

Richard Webby, PhD, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds and a researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, in Memphis, Tennessee, said the group recommended two new strains, one targeting an H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a virus identified in Australia in a child who had returned from a trip to India. 

In its zoonotic flu candidate virus report, the group said the clade 2.3.2.1a viruses were detected in poultry in Bangladesh and in wild birds and poultry in India, where it also turned up in captive tigers, a captive leopard, and domestic cats. “The circulation of clade 2.3.2.1a viruses in these countries has continued despite the introduction of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses,” the group wrote.

Webby said the second newly recommended candidate strain targets an H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4h virus once dominant in Southeast Asia that has reemerged in poultry in a few provinces in southeastern China. Two human H5N6 illnesses involving clade 2.3.4.4h were reported in 2024.",1j0hyix,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/who-advisers-swap-out-h3n2-strains-next-northern-hemisphere-flu-vaccines,56

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740767713.0,Could flu shot supply fall short this year? FDA's canceled meeting sparks worries,"The Food and Drug Administration’s abrupt decision on Wednesday to cancel next month’s vaccine advisory committee meeting — where experts recommend the strains for next season’s flu shot — is raising concerns about whether the U.S. will have enough of the vaccine for the next flu season.

Drugmakers already face a tight deadline each year to produce enough doses for distribution in the fall. 

The federal government typically places preorders for the vaccines in January and February, which appears to have been placed as usual. But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots are usually available by the end of July or early August, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. [...] 

Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until **late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.**

“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”

The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 86 children and 19,000 adults have died. 

In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said the agency will “make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.” [...] ",1j0esos,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-supply-fall-short-year-fdas-canceled-meeting-sparks-worries-rcna194031,49

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740692586.0,CDC: 13% of kids who died from flu this year had brain damage,"Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that 13% of children who have died from seasonal flu this season had influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), a severe neurologic complication. 

Included in these cases are four patients who had acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), the most severe form of IAE, which can lead to varying degrees of brain dysfunction, inflammation, and other neurologic problems. 

The data come from the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System, which has tracked kids' flu deaths since 2004. Encephalitis is swelling of the brain, while encephalopathy is a more general term for brain dysfunction that is not primarily an inflammatory condition.

**ANE in 4 cases this season**

The authors said the CDC began receiving reports of ANE in children who died from flu in January, and the agency contacted state health departments to ascertain whether any pediatric flu-related deaths with IAE also involved a diagnosis of ANE.

As of February 8, the most recent date used in the study, 68 US children had been confirmed to have died from seasonal influenza. Among them, 9 had IAE (13%). (As of the CDC's latest FluView report on February 21, US pediatric flu deaths had risen to 86.)

The authors said that, of the 9 pediatric deaths this season with IAE, 4 patients had fatal ANE. All 4 ANE deaths involved children under the age of 5 years, and all had laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1). Two of the 4 children had been vaccinated against flu, 2 received the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and all required mechanical ventilation.

Fifty-four percent of patients with fatal IAE had no underlying medical conditions, and only 20% had received flu vaccination 2 or more weeks before illness onset.

**Unknown if numbers are to be expected**

The authors compared IAE and ANE records among pediatric influenza deaths seen in the past 15 years. From the 2010-11 to 2024-25 flu seasons, officials reported 1,840 US pediatric flu-associated deaths, of which 166 (9%) involved IAE, ranging from 0% (2020-21 season) to 14% (2011-12 season).

Of the 166 fatal pediatric flu-related patients with IAE, the median age was 6 years, 52% were female, and 40% were non-Hispanic White. In total 119 patients (72%) had influenza A, and 46 (28%) had influenza B virus infection.

The vast majority of IAE patients (93%) required mechanical ventilation. Other documented acute complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (57; 34%), pneumonia (54; 33%), and sepsis (47; 28%). All but 11 patients died while hospitalized. 

Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers.

""Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers,"" the authors wrote.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740666345.0,A child is dead from measles: Here are five things on my mind. (via Your Local Epidemiologist),"A little child is dead. From measles. In the United States. In 2025. They were unvaccinated and otherwise healthy, making it the first casualty of the West Texas measles outbreak—and the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. One death from a preventable disease is one too many.

Here are five things on my mind, followed by your questions answered. (We’re getting a lot! Keep ’em coming.)

**This didn’t happen randomly.** West Texas has pockets of alarmingly low MMR vaccination rates. In the area where this outbreak began, one in five children is unvaccinated. Measles spreads like wildfire in unprotected communities—it’s the most contagious virus on earth. On average, one infected person will spread it to 12–18 unvaccinated people.

**Measles is not just a rash.** While many children recover from measles, some die of pneumonia caused by the virus. Measles can also lead to deafness and brain damage, and it can wipe out a huge fraction of immune memory to other diseases, like the flu, leading to an increase in all-cause deaths years later. The risks of infection far outweigh the risks of the vaccine, as the New York Times shows beautifully below.

**Social media is full of falsehoods**—including from the HHS Secretary himself. Today, Secretary Kennedy briefly addressed the outbreak, but we caught three major inaccuracies:

**Yes, this is an unusual year.** RFK Jr. incorrectly said there’s “nothing unusual; we have measles outbreaks every year.” First, there’s nothing normal about a child dying from measles. Also, this year’s tally has already surpassed 8 out of the past 15 years’ annual measles counts. (See graph below.) We are only 1.5 months into 2025. Finally, we have only had 4 outbreaks with more than 100 cases in the past 10 years. West Texas is now on the list. Instead, Kennedy should publicly state his support for MMR vaccines. (Which he hasn’t.) 

**Those hospitalized are due to troubled breathing, not quarantining** like he incorrectly said. None of the hospitalized cases are vaccinated.

**There has been one death so far**. He incorrectly said there have been two deaths. I don’t know how you get that wrong.

To every West Texas parent getting their child vaccinated now: You are making the right choice. It’s never too late to change your mind, and there’s no shame in doing so. You’re protecting your child and your community, and we appreciate you.

**This outbreak isn’t over.** We’re at 124 cases in 33 days. We don’t yet know how large it will get, but the “force of infection” is strong. For reference, the last major U.S. measles outbreak (New York, 2019) hit 1,000+ cases. This could be worse, but thanks to vaccination, behavioral shifts, and the tireless work of public health teams, it’s not spreading as fast as it could. [...] 

**Bottomline**

Measles is surging, and with it comes unnecessary suffering—even death. Vaccines have been victims of their success, and this outbreak directly illustrates the consequences of declining vaccination rates. Unfortunately, we will move backward before moving forward again. RFK Jr. is not helping.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740705770.0,Minnesota farmer uses innovate approach to keep flock healthy amid bird flu outbreak,"A western Minnesota farmer says his innovative approach is keeping his flock healthy amid the increasing threat of bird flu to the state's chickens and turkeys.

""This has been one of the craziest times because in the past it would come, we'd have it for a few months, and it would go away,"" Jake Vlaminck, president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, said.

But Vlaminck said he and other turkey farmers have been dealing with H5N1 for three straight years. His family operates Fahlun Farms, which was hit hard by the flu in 2023. That's when he decided to buy a laser to keep away ducks and geese — the main carriers of bird flu.

""We've been able to cut our mortality down in about half, and I want to attribute a lot of that to these lasers,"" Vlaminck said.

He isn't alone. Over the past two years, Minnesota poultry farmers have installed 100 bird lasers throughout the state. During that time, Vlaminck said the mortality rate for commercial turkeys and chickens dropped from 4 million to 2 million statewide.

Humans can't see the laser during the day, but the birds can. Their eyes pick up a green beam, which causes them to fly away from the turkeys. For people, it's visible at night. He installed his first laser on top of a barn.

Vlaminck's second laser is attached to the top of that windmill tower. Both lasers on his farm cover about 500 feet.

They cross over each other, covering the entire farm. Their sequences vary, so migratory birds don't get used to their patterns. Vlaminck said there's hope a bird flu vaccine will eventually be available, but until then, he'll keep his lasers running, 24/7.

“We are following the measles epidemic every day,” Kennedy said during the meeting. **“Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year there were 16. So, it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”**

Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, told NBC News that all of the roughly 20 children she’s treated so far have had trouble breathing and none were vaccinated.

An unvaccinated, school-aged child died from the outbreak, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced on Wednesday.

It’s the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015, all the more notable because the disease was considered eliminated in the U.S. as of 2000 given widespread vaccination.

contagioncuriosity,Least-Plantain973,1740623370.0,Trump Team Weighs Pulling Funds for Moderna Bird Flu Vaccine,"US health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna Inc., people familiar with the matter said.

The review is part of a government push to examine spending on messenger RNA-based vaccines, the technology that powered Moderna’s Covid vaccine. The bird flu shot contract was awarded to Moderna in the Biden administration’s final days, sending the company’s stock up 13% in the two days following the Jan. 17 announcement.

The US is in the midst of a record-breaking bird flu outbreak that’s affected dozens of cattle herds along with poultry flocks nationwide, sending egg prices soaring. While human cases have been relatively rare, the virus has caused deaths in the past, and experts are concerned that it could become more transmissible and dangerous.

“While it is crucial that the US Department and Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production,” a spokesperson for HHS said in a written statement.

Shares of Moderna fell as much as 6.6% in trading after US markets closed Wednesday. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Moderna said in January it was gearing up for a big final-stage trial of its vaccine, after successfully completing an early-stage trial last year. Without funding, that big trial may not happen.

Messenger RNA technology was the foundation of Covid vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer Inc., which worked with partner BioNTech SE on its pandemic shots. The technology allows vaccines to be designed and made more quickly than traditional approaches.

The government also told Vaxart Inc. to stop much of the work on a federal contract for research on a new oral Covid vaccine, according to regulatory filings.The contract provided up to $453 million, according to government records.

Moderna has been under pressure to find new sources of revenue as its Covid vaccine sales fall sharply and it spends heavily on its pipeline. The contract was pushed through with some urgency, the people said, because of concerns that the Trump administration would be less willing to fund vaccine makers.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was sworn in two weeks ago as head of HHS, has openly criticized Covid shots. In a 2021 meeting of a Louisiana House of Representatives oversight meeting on Covid vaccination, he called it “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”

Government funding for research to develop vaccines like Moderna’s as well as therapeutics for potential pandemic threats comes from an office within HHS. Early in the pandemic, Moderna secured a $483 million contract from the office to develop, test and scale up manufacturing of an mRNA-based Covid vaccine.

Moderna became embroiled in a patent dispute with the National Institutes of Health over credit for the company’s vaccine. The government objected after Moderna listed only company scientists as inventors on a patent application, calling the NIH researchers who helped develop it “collaborators.”

Kennedy has recently walked back some of his anti-vaccine rhetoric, but key vaccine meetings and public health campaigns overseen by agencies within HHS have reportedly been paused. Health workers within a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunization unit were also recently laid off, Bloomberg reported last week.",1iz5agd,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-regulation-and-compliance/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine,366
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740669308.0,"Trump administration takes aim at bird flu. For now, the cattle will have to wait","The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday an additional $1 billion to help the nation’s poultry industry combat an accelerating outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, which has devastated farmers and driven the price of eggs to record highs. [...] 

But the new plan does not include any additional efforts to curb the spread of the virus among dairy cattle. Since first being confirmed in Texas last March, outbreaks of H5N1 have been detected in 973 dairy herds across 17 states.

The shift signals the **new administration’s approach to the disease as primarily an issue of economic concern, but leaves questions about how the USDA intends to manage the threat H5N1-infected cows pose to people**. [...] 

As long as there’s that type of transmission going on, there’ll always be an increased risk of transmission to humans,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. He questioned the effectiveness of attempting to solve the H5N1 problem in one species but not another. **“Unless you really eradicate it out of dairy [cows] and poultry production, humans are going to be at risk.”**

In a statement to STAT, the USDA said that “The measures announced today focus on strengthening biosecurity and the response for the poultry industry, however, USDA will continue to work closely with dairy producers, as they are a critical part of the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] conversation and response.”

Since the start of the outbreaks in dairy cattle, the agency has maintained that its goal is ultimately to eradicate H5N1 from cows, which, when infected, shed large amounts of the virus in their milk. Last year, the USDA approved the use of more than $2.1 billion in emergency funds to address H5N1 in commercial livestock and poultry, including $834 million for a new national milk surveillance program. The agency had suggested that regular monitoring of bulk milk tanks and measures like a requirement that cows moving across state lines be tested prior to transport would lead to a situation where the virus would run out of new animals to infect. 

But recent events have dimmed those prospects. The launch of bulk milk testing in late 2024 led to the discoveries of new introductions of H5N1 in cows, likely from wild birds. [...] 

“We cannot effectively control H5N1 if the virus remains circulating in dairy,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. “We learned that throughout 2024.”
Mike Payne, a food animal veterinary and biosecurity expert with the University of California, Davis’ Western Institute for Food Safety and Security, told STAT that the new USDA investment is a welcome signal that the agency recognizes H5N1 as the most significant animal health crisis in America in the last 100 years. 

In addition to addressing challenges in biosecurity and providing indemnity assistance, he hopes that some of the $1 billion will also go to expanding research into how the virus moves between farms. But he’s not optimistic that the new administration’s approach will eliminate the virus from the farm animals in the U.S. anytime soon. 

“We have been trying to control avian influenza for decades through test and slaughter and have made no discernable progress in eradicating the disease,” Payne said in an email. “We have not eradicated other versions of the influenza virus family in swine, horses, dogs, cats or humans. Avian influenza, and specifically the current H5N1 strain, has become endemic, full stop. We will not control the outbreak in poultry until we control it in cattle. This will require cattle vaccination.”

**Rollins says the USDA will invest $1 billion in the new plan, which will be paid for, at least in part, by Department of Government Efficiency cuts.**

USDA will spend $500 million to help enhance biosecurity measures to help keep the virus off farms. **This can include restricting access to farms, increasing sanitation and improved hygiene.**

Rollins said USDA will expand a pilot program started under the Biden administration which sends USDA inspectors to assess biosecurity measures on farms.

The US government will spend $400 million to reimburse farmers with affected flocks.

**The US already compensates farmers for the loss of their chickens. In December, USDA added a requirement that poultry producers pass a biosecurity audit before they could be compensated.**

USDA, which regulates vaccines for animals, is exploring the use of vaccines and therapeutics but it hasn’t authorized use of any yet.

**The US will cut back on regulations on egg producers and “make it easier for families to raise backyard chickens.”**

The US government will consider temporary imports of eggs to reduce prices. 

**Importantly, the agency stopped short of authorizing the use of a bird flu vaccine for poultry in the United States. US poultry producers have strongly resisted vaccinating their flocks because America is a leading exporter, and many countries won’t accept birds that have been vaccinated.**

The World Organization for Animal Health says vaccination may now be a necessary measure to control the spread of bird flu, which has moved from being a seasonal scourge to becoming a year-round threat for many different species of mammals, including dairy cattle.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740604247.0,Why the good news about the mpox outbreak of 2025 isn't really good after all,"Dr. Jean Kaseya has a warning for the world: ""We are playing with fire.""

Kaseya is director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He's talking about mpox, a virus that causes painful blisters and can be fatal.

For much of the world, mpox — formerly known as monkeypox — seems like a virus from a few years ago. There was a global outbreak in 2022 and 2023 but the virus is no longer circulating as widely in Europe and the U.S.

However, large swathes of Africa are in the midst of a major outbreak. The epicenter is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with more than 2,000 suspected cases reported each week for months, according to Africa CDC.

There seemed to be encouraging news at the end of January, when the number of new cases dropped suddenly. But mpox trackers are not celebrating.

""This decrease in terms of cases is not the reality,"" says Kaseya. Instead, he says, this is a sign that the ability to monitor and tally new cases has been interrupted. He attributes this to two things: ""The combination between insecurity [and] lack of funding.""

The insecurity he's referring to is in eastern DRC – a hotspot in the mpox outbreak – where rebel forces have taken control of key areas. The violence has interrupted mpox control and reporting work.

The lack of funding is the result of the abrupt freeze in U.S. foreign aid instituted after President Trump took office on Jan. 20, along with the decision to fire or place on leave most of the 10,000 people working for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Almost all of the agency's work has stalled, including critical parts of the mpox response effort. Trump also ordered the U.S. to leave the World Health Organization and stop communicating with WHO officials, who have played a critical role in mpox containment.

""It's like watching a train wreck in real time – and not being able to do a thing about it,"" says a health worker formerly part of the U.S. response team. The worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the federal government.

**The outlook before Trump's inauguration**

The global community rallied after both Africa CDC and WHO declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a public health emergency in August 2024.

Over a billion dollars was pledged to the control effort by countries across Africa and Europe as well as Japan and the U.S., according to Africa CDC. President Biden promised $500 million as well as a million mpox vaccine doses.

The hope was to stop this outbreak of the virus and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the world. However, the DRC can be a challenging place to fight an infectious disease. It's an enormous country with poor road networks and a hot spot in the outbreak is in the war-torn east where overcrowded camps for displaced people are common. The mpox virus spreads through sexual contact as well as close contact, even via bed sheets.

The U.S. plays an outsized role in the public health of the DRC. Last year, the U.S. provided almost 70% of all humanitarian aid going to the country, sending $965,000,000 to the DRC according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. And when it came to mpox response, the U.S. funds have supported a wide range of efforts from training lab technicians to providing diagnostic tests to supplying gloves and gowns for health workers to working with veterinarians for disease surveillance in animal populations.

Then, in late January, the campaign to quash the virus was interrupted.

**A turning point — for the worse**

On January 27, M23 — a rebel group that the United Nations says is backed by Rwanda — swept into Goma, a city in the eastern DRC that has been a hub for disease response efforts. Intense fighting engulfed the city for several days and early U.N. estimates suggest a few thousand people were killed.

""From one day to another, everything just collapsed,"" says Paulin Nkwosseu, chief of field operations for UNICEF in the DRC. UNICEF is the humanitarian agency funded and operated by the United Nations.

Nkwosseu, who was traveling when the violence erupted, says the violence didn't just pause mpox response efforts. It likely made the outbreak significantly worse. That's because the vast majority of mpox patients in isolation wards fled to seek shelter from the fighting.

""After the fighting erupted, we managed to locate only 15 [mpox patients]. So the rest are probably living within the community with a huge, huge risk of contamination,"" says Nkwosseu. ""This is a very big risk in terms of public health.""

Africa CDC reports that at least 400 mpox patients fled.

Nkwosseu adds that the risk of spreading the virus is particularly big because the fighting meant many people lost access to clean water or electricity.

Even if aid workers could locate all the mpox patients who fled, Nkwosseu says, it's unclear where they would now go to be isolated and make sure they don't spread the disease to others. ""Six of the seven mpox treatment centers have been looted and totally destroyed, including two supported by UNICEF,"" he says. ""All the stocks of supplies, treatment, medicines, mattresses, tents — everything was looted.""

Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, says the violence has been a major setback. ""All of the investment we've made over the last number of months to establish mpox surveillance, mpox control, mpox vaccinations – all of that is interrupted, on hold and impossible to continue,"" he says.

**'Flying blind'**

At the same time as the security situation in eastern DRC deteriorated, President Trump froze almost all U.S. foreign assistance. While a judge has ruled that the funds should start flowing again and the administration has issued waivers for certain ""lifesaving activities"" — including the campaign against mpox — the aid world has faced major upheavals, with abrupt stop work orders and terminated contracts. 

Public health experts say there are at least two areas where the impacts of the aid freeze are already being felt on the mpox response.

First, the vast majority of the mpox vaccines pledged by the U.S. are stuck in a warehouse. While the vaccines were donated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, USAID was facilitating the transfer to the DRC. And so the stop work orders halted the process, according to an individual who was working on the process and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

In order for the vaccine donation to continue in the DRC, this individual says, HHS needs to release the vaccines – which involves the Trump administration affirming the donation – and USAID leadership needs to approve for funds to be dispersed to partners who would then help pay for the operational costs associated with the vaccine transfer.

Second, the U.S. had been funding the secure transportation of suspected mpox samples from clinics to labs for testing — but no longer.

""We are scaling up the equipment for laboratory capacity, but the transportation of samples has become a nightmare,"" says Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, head of Africa CDC's incident management support team based in DRC.

Ngongo says his team has documented a steep drop in the testing rate — the portion of suspected cases where there is testing to confirm the diagnosis — even in parts of the country where violence has not disrupted mpox response efforts.

""The U.S., in particular, had been putting a lot of funding and effort into strengthening this surveillance. Without this piece, you're blind. You're flying blind in outbreak response,"" says an individual who had worked on the U.S. response and requested anonymity for fear of retribution.

There has been a waiver granted by the U.S. government for mpox response to continue despite the freeze in foreign aid. NPR obtained an internal memo sent to USAID staff from Mark Lloyd, who was performing the duties of assistant administrator for the USAID Bureau for Global Health. On Feb. 13, he wrote that rapid emergency response is continuing for diseases like mpox. ""This includes detection, prevention, and containment efforts ... such as the following activities: risk information for affected populations, active surveillance, infection prevention and control, support for testing, case management and treatment, and supply of medical countermeasures.""

However, restarting such activities has proved difficult. The payments have not resumed for mpox response, there are currently no American staff at the USAID mission in the capital of the DRC and Trump's order for the CDC officials not to communicate with WHO is still in place.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined an interview request. The press line at USAID rang busy. NPR sent a request for comment to the State Department — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is acting administrator of USAID; the questions covered vaccine donations, transport of suspected mpox samples and the impact of disruptions in U.S. aid on the mpox outbreak. The request was not answered in time for our publication deadline.

It's not just mpox that is being impacted, public health experts warn, but a whole host of health threats that the DRC is confronting right now, from measles to cholera to widespread malnutrition.

Kaseya worries the deteriorating health situations could ""be an entry point for a new pandemic,"" he says.

""DRC has a very fragile health system, and USAID is an integral part of this fabric that is already stretched very, very thin,"" says Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, who has worked on mpox in the DRC for decades.

Without U.S. support, there will be ""disastrous setbacks"" for health in the DRC and because diseases don't respect borders, she worries, those setbacks could be felt elsewhere in the world, too.",1iyyee3,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/25/g-s1-49693/mpox-vaccines-democratic-republic-congo-usaid,127

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740574510.0,California: Public Health Confirms Measles Case in Los Angeles County,"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has been notified of one case of measles in a non-Los Angeles County resident who traveled to Los Angeles International (LAX) airport while infectious.


**This person arrived on Korean Air flight KAL11/KE11 at the Tom Bradley International Airport (TBIT) Terminal B on February 19th.**


**Individuals who were at Terminal B on February 19th from approximately 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler. In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, passengers assigned to specific seats that may have been exposed on Korean Airlines flight KAL11/KE11 on February 19th will be notified by local departments of health.**

 These agencies work together to investigate communicable disease exposures on international flights to the United States. 


Exposed individuals should confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles. If they have not had measles in the past and have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, they are at risk of contracting measles if they have been exposed. Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at this location during the date and times listed above are at risk of developing measles from 7 to 21 days after being exposed and should monitor for symptoms. Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days (March 11th) are no longer at risk.


“Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County Health Officer. “A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure. Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults. The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measle vaccine.”",1iymuxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagionCuriosity/comments/1iymuxp/california_public_health_confirms_measles_case_in/,366

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740605471.0,"CDC shares clinical and sequencing details from 3 recent human H5N1 cases: Both had D1.1 genotype, notable mutations","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today shared new sequencing findings on samples from two people with H5N1 avian flu infections, one a patient from Wyoming who was hospitalized after contact with backyard poultry and the other a dairy worker from Nevada. It also fleshed out clinical findings for the two patients, plus another from Ohio.

The CDC said the patient from Wyoming, who had underlying health conditions, had respiratory symptoms and had tested negative for the virus from an upper respiratory sample but was positive on a lower respiratory sample. Meanwhile, the patient from Nevada was a dairy worker whose only symptom was conjunctivitis.

Similarly, the CDC added that a recent patient from Ohio, who had prolonged contact with sick and dead poultry, initially tested negative on upper-respiratory samples but was positive on lower respiratory tract sampling. It noted that both of the patients with poultry exposure had severe illness and were hospitalized but are both home and recovering.

**Both had D1.1 genotype, notable mutations**

Sequencing of viruses from both patients revealed the D1.1 genotype, which is circulating widely in wild birds and poultry, with known jumps to dairy cows in Nevada and Arizona. 

The tests also identified some notable mutations. The Wyoming patient’s virus had the E627K mutation in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein that has been linked to efficient replication in people and mammals and was also seen in a human case from Texas in 2024. 

**The CDC said the Nevada patent’s virus had the D701N mutation in PB2 that has been linked to more efficient virus replication in mammalian cells and was seen in a patient from Chile in 2023.** It added that the nucleotide sequence was almost identical to viruses from the dairy cows the patient worked with.

For both patients, the CDC didn’t identify any genetic changes in the virus that would impact the effectiveness of antiviral medications or H5 candidate vaccine viruses.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740574839.0,Upheaval and firings at CDC raise fears about disease outbreak response,"The widespread upheaval at federal health agencies in the first month of the Trump administration comes at a time when the U.S. faces infectious disease threats on multiple fronts: The ongoing spread of bird flu around the country; the risk of emerging insect-borne viruses; and a ballooning measles outbreak in the Southwest.

Abroad, there are new strains of mpox and deadly outbreaks of Ebola and polio just a plane ride away.

Recent mass firings, primarily aimed at new and temporary workers, have thinned the ranks of the workforce that would aid in the response to outbreaks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to interviews with more than half a dozen current staff. **They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.**

The situation has infectious disease experts worried.

""This seems like the worst time to be taking steps to degrade our nation's preparedness,"" says Dr. David Fleming, a former CDC official who now chairs the agency's Advisory Committee to the Director. ""They are greatly diminishing CDC and the country's ability to respond to emerging infectious threats.""

Those who work at CDC tell NPR they're deeply concerned about the prospect of future job cuts, and the weakening of policies around vaccination. They also caution that restrictions around communication could hamper the agency's response to unfolding outbreaks.

""The big thing that's impacting us now is the demoralizing work environment, intentional chaos, uncertainty over our jobs,"" says one CDC staffer.

 ""Outbreak responses are very stressful when you have all the available resources. To be on outbreak response now in this climate is a whole new level of complexity and stress.""

Dr. Deblina Datta, an infectious disease physician who retired from the CDC in 2023 says ""this is just a very dangerous period of time for our country because we are addressing threats on multiple fronts. In my 24 years at the CDC, I have never seen the morale hit that is going on right now.""

In response to NPR, a spokesperson for the CDC listed seven emergency responses that are currently active — such as measles in Texas, influenza A/H5N1 and mpox — but did not answer other questions about the extent of the layoffs and their impact on the agency's operations.

Fleming and other members of the committee sent a letter to acting CDC director Dr. Susan Monarez and HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on February 17, urging them to ""take immediate action to forestall the impending crisis to our Nation's health and safety"" precipitated by the firings. They haven't responded.

Key staff for detecting potential threats fired 
The full extent of the cuts remains unclear, although NPR has reported that about 750 people were let go from CDC in the first wave of firings earlier this month.

And more cuts could be on the way.

""If we have another round of layoffs, then we really will start to feel the pain in a very tangible way,"" the CDC staffer said.

Among those who already lost their jobs: a cadre of scientists who assist local health authorities in detecting diseases, staff who are charged with preventing the introduction of dangerous pathogens from abroad, and some involved in modeling disease outbreaks to get ahead of them, CDC sources said.

One of the programs decimated by the cuts — the Laboratory Leadership Service fellowship — had previously enlisted Ph.D.-trained researchers to pitch in on disease responses **for dengue in American Samoa and Puerto Rico, Marburg virus in New York and a new rabies variant in Nebraska, according to three current CDC employees.** In some cases, the fellows are needed to develop lab tests in fast-moving situations.

""They are the first responders,"" said another CDC staffer, ""Without them on the front lines, who will develop these tests? Who will do these tests?""

In fact, one CDC fellow who received a termination letter had just spent weeks helping the state of Florida develop a plan for a potential wave of Oropouche this coming summer.

Oropouche, a viral disease spread by mosquitoes and midges — and also through sexual contact — caused large outbreaks in South America and the Caribbean last year, leading to birth defects and fetal deaths similar to those caused by the Zika virus. **Florida health officials had discerned from testing past samples that cases in their state had gone undetected, the fellow told NPR: ""They were terrified there might be thousands of samples come summer, and they had to be ready.""**

The pause on communications when Trump took office, however, prevented the fellow from sharing the response plans with the state — and now the plans could languish, since the fellow has been let go.

The firings also swept up two CDC workers, both part of a public health training program, who'd been deployed to work on a tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas City, CDC sources told NPR.

Another arm of the CDC feeling the pinch of layoffs is the already overstretched team that oversees port health stations, screening travelers for dangerous pathogens at airports and land border crossings.

Three out of the 20 port health stations now have no CDC staff and half have no officer in charge, according to a current CDC employee, who's not authorized to speak publicly.

These stations are a first line of defense. Staff there assess humans and animals for disease threats and, if a case of illness is found, work with local authorities on contact tracing if other passengers were potentially exposed.

With countries dealing with outbreaks of Ebola and other diseases, it's critical to have these trained workers in place who can recognize someone with signs or symptoms and coordinate the response, says Dr. Kimberly Dodd, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University and a former USDA official.

Stations are increasingly covering for each other, and sometimes ""choosing not to do certain things because there aren't enough resources,"" a CDC employee with direct knowledge of the situation told NPR. ""It's like a web and when you rip out part of that, you can't expect it to work the same as before,"" the individual says.

**Fears about readiness for emerging risks**

It will take time to see the consequences of the cracks introduced by these mass firings – and the broader attempt to downsize federal health agencies.

""The ripple effects, and how that impacts our infectious disease and pandemic preparedness is going to be larger and more widespread than we're able to put our arms around right now,"" says Dodd.

Some worry the ongoing turbulence could distract from some of the most pressing public health threats on our doorstep, including bird flu and measles.

Aside from firings, other agency functions have been interrupted. For instance, the CDC's forthcoming meeting of its vaccine advisors was postponed, playing into concerns that vaccine policy could be disrupted by the new administration.

And the CDC pulled a successful advertising campaign for the flu vaccine, amid the worst flu season in years.

The clampdown on external communication that took hold when President Trump came into office impeded some lines of communication and frayed longstanding relationships between local health officials, their partners and the federal government.

While routine meetings and updates about bird flu and other urgent threats have resumed to some extent, ""communication is still not where it needs to be,"" says Lori Freeman, executive director of the National Association of City and County Health Officials.

The targeting of the CDC was top of mind when Freeman met with Texas health officials last week amid ongoing fears about the state's measles outbreak.

""It feels like there's a lot of areas that are threatening our ability to do work on the ground,"" she says. She adds that she fears the CDC may pull back funds that local public health agencies rely on.

Since mid-January, 124 cases of measles have been reported in the South Plains region of Texas, and 9 cases in neighboring New Mexico.

Both states tell NPR they are in regular contact with their counterparts at the CDC. So far though, the agency doesn't have a major presence on the ground.

""We would only request assistance if the state did not have the resources to respond to the outbreak,"" according to Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, who confirmed that one CDC epidemiologist is in the region.

But in the City of Lubbock, where hospitals are caring for patients with measles, some local health officials are calling for more help, whether that's from state or federal authorities.

""We need some more boots on the ground to be combating this,"" Katherine Wells, director of public health for the City of Lubbock, told NPR.

Robert Nott, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Health, said that ""on the measles front, our relationship with the CDC remains productive.""

Overall, notes Datta, the former CDC official, disease outbreak response is fundamentally a human-based enterprise. While it depends on data, important information needs to be relayed between epidemiologists, health care providers on the ground and public health authorities.

""Those are not automated systems, not by a long shot,"" says Datta, the former CDC official.

""It takes a practiced eye to say, 'what are the next set of questions that we need to be asking? How can we confirm or negate our worst fears?"" says Datta.

For instance, if a few polio cases are reported from different countries over a few months, it would take a birds-eye view to understand how they're related. Knowing where the cases are coming from is key to effectively fighting an outbreak, she says.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740528797.0,Anti-vaccine movement falsely blames measles shots for Texas outbreak,"As a measles outbreak sweeps through Texas, officially sickening 124 people, mostly unvaccinated children, and hospitalizing 18, anti-vaccine groups are pushing a familiar and false theory: The highly contagious virus is being caused by the vaccine itself.  

“The narrative is that it’s a failure to vaccinate when we know it is a failing vaccine,” said Sayer Ji, a self-described natural health and wellness thought leader who is not a doctor. He outlined his theory Monday during an interview on the internet morning show from Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit formerly led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who resigned after being chosen by President Donald Trump to run the Department of Health and Human Services. 

Ji’s discussion with Children’s Health Defense’s director of programming, Polly Tommey, comes as Texas health authorities work to contain an outbreak of one of the world’s most contagious diseases, in part through a campaign to vaccinate residents. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot is remarkably safe and effective, experts said, and the mild reaction that some people experience after receiving it is unlikely to be confused with measles.

But that has not stopped Ji, Tommey and a growing chorus of state “health freedom” groups and conspiracy theory websites from pushing the false claims. They’ve also argued the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be testing to determine the difference between these theorized vaccine-caused cases and naturally occurring wild-type measles. And they’ve suggested the tests weren’t being done as part of a wider conspiracy or “psychological operation” against Kennedy. 

""It is no coincidence in my mind that Bobby gets confirmed to be secretary of HHS, and immediately we have a measles outbreak,” said Tommey, who is the mother of an adult child whom she says was injured by the MMR vaccine. “Parent to parent, do not go anywhere near that vaccine.” 

The fears about the measles vaccine are ungrounded, said Dr. Matthew Washam, director of epidemiology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio who co-authored a paper about vaccine shedding  — when a vaccine releases parts of a virus, resulting in spread of infection. Ji inaccurately cited the paper on his blog as evidence for his unsupported theory. 

""No, the MMR vaccine does not cause measles infection,” said Washam.

While an MMR vaccine can sometimes induce mild and temporary reactions such as a low-grade fever and rash, actual measles infections are more severe and can be deadly — they often come with high fevers, a full-body rash, ear infections, dehydration and pneumonia — and are linked to direct exposure, not the vaccine. It’s unlikely for the two to be confused, Washam said.  

“This is a completely different phenomena,” Washam said. “It’s the body’s immune response to the vaccine. It’s not wild-type measles infection. Most importantly, it’s not transmissible to others, and it’s not a cause of an outbreak.” 

There has never been a documented case of the MMR vaccine causing a measles infection that spread to others, Washam said, adding, “It’s an extremely great vaccine.”  

He called the safety and efficacy of the measles vaccine “truly remarkable” and stressed its importance, especially for young children.  

Though the symptoms for measles can sound mild, complications can be dangerous and even deadly. Out of every 1,000 cases, around 200 children require hospitalization, 50 develop pneumonia, one experiences brain swelling that can lead to deafness or disability, and between one and three die.  

The theories espoused about Texas echo Kennedy’s false statements about the measles outbreak in Samoa in 2019. That fall, as young children were hospitalized and dying from measles infections, Kennedy wrote to the Pacific Island nation’s prime minister, warning about the possible danger of the vaccine campaign. “Nobody died in Samoa from measles,” he told an interviewer last August. “They were dying from a bad vaccine.” 

Kennedy has not commented on the Texas outbreak since being confirmed as HHS secretary this month, but some of his early moves — including the shelving of planned ads for the flu vaccine and the postponement of a meeting of a vaccine advisory panel — have concerned public health experts. 

He has previously downplayed the danger of measles, a common tactic of the anti-vaccine movement and a line of argument that Ji and Tommey repeated this week on the Children’s Health Defense show. They falsely theorized that the supposed vaccine measles strain was potentially more dangerous than so-called natural measles, which Ji said without evidence came with benefits to the immune system and reduced the risk of certain cancers.  [...] 

In an email, Ji disputed the experts’ opinions, calling them “an oversimplification that lacks conclusive scientific verification in the absence of proper genotyping,” and suggested a reporter consult a different report on vaccine shedding published by an anti-vaccine organization.

To Washam, the difference between measles and the MMR vaccine is the risk one is willing to take — especially for young children — to get immunity from measles.  

“Were you given a very safe and effective MMR vaccine and therefore have immunity against measles?” he said. “Or did you have to survive wild-type infection, which can be a very severe infection, especially in young children?” 

For now, the conspiracy theory appears confined to the internet and hasn’t yet taken root in the communities where measles is spreading, according to Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock who has treated several exposed families. Montanez said vaccine hesitancy there is currently driven by limited education, cultural isolation in the Mennonite community and a perceived lack of necessity. 

“A lot of our parents are actually really open to asking questions,” she said. “It’s not misinformation about the vaccine causing outbreaks that’s the issue here. It’s more about, ‘Why should we vaccinate if we’ve never seen this disease?’”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740543493.0,"Flu vaccine this season may be poorly matched, early CDC data suggests","This season's influenza vaccine may have been a poor match to a strain of the flu virus that caused many infections this winter, early data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests.

The CDC's latest data come as much of the U.S. is finally seeing signs of a slowdown in influenza activity after waves of illness this past fall and winter that climbed to the worst rates recorded from hospitals and doctor's offices since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.

""This is a bad year, no doubt about it,"" Dr. Jon LaPook, CBS News chief medical correspondent, told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday.

Up to 910,000 hospitalizations are estimated to have been caused by the flu since October 2024, which puts the season on track to be the most severe in at least a decade. 

""Depending on the strain, depending on what's going on, it could really vary. And this year is brutal,"" said LaPook.

Every season, the CDC's scientists test a sample of flu viruses collected from labs around the country against strains that health authorities had picked out for use in the latest update to the annual flu vaccine.

""CDC antigenically characterizes about 2,000 flu viruses during a typical flu season to monitor for changes in circulating viruses and to compare how similar these viruses are to those included in flu vaccines,"" Paul Prince, a CDC spokesperson, said in a statement.

Many of the flu viruses that the CDC has tested this season were ""well-recognized"" by antibodies targeted to the vaccine, which helps the body fight off the infection, the agency reported this month. The testing is done using antibodies from ferrets, which have similar influenza symptoms to humans.

But against the H3N2 strain of influenza, which this season has made up just over half of the influenza A viruses scrutinized by the agency, only around 50.9% of the samples were ""well-recognized"" by the antibodies. 

That's far below this time last year, when the CDC reported that all H3N2 viruses they tested were ""well-recognized"" by the vaccine virus antibodies.

Experts cautioned that many other factors can play a role in changing how effectively vaccines hold up against influenza in the real world. For example, unlike the laboratory ferrets, people's immune systems build up defenses to parts of the virus encountered in previous years.

""Humans mostly have pre-existing immunity, which can result in different immune responses. These can be broader or narrower or different,"" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the University of Georgia's Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research, in an email.

**Tompkins said that it was possible for the vaccines to offer good protection, even in situations where the shots were not a good match.**

""Humans, once you get infected and reinfected, your system typically starts to become more focused on the spots on the virus that don't change as frequently or are more effective at neutralizing it,"" Josh Petrie, associate research scientist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told CBS News.

Petrie said that well-matched vaccines tend to correlate with higher effectiveness. But even with well-matched shots, he said that seasons with more H3N2 viruses often result in lower vaccine effectiveness estimates — and more severe seasons overall — compared to other circulating strains.

""As a rule of thumb, at least in recent years, effectiveness against H3N2 has typically been lower than H1N1. **And also as a rule of thumb, H3N2 typically has a higher impact on older adults and you see a lot more hospitalizations,"" Petrie said.**

More data could come soon. The first estimates from CDC's influenza vaccine effectiveness studies for this season are expected to be released by the end of this month.

The World Health Organization is also expected to release a report soon from a meeting to decide next season's influenza vaccine update.

CDC officials are also being allowed to participate in the meeting, a spokesperson said, despite the president's order that has mostly banned U.S. scientists from talking with the WHO.

Not all early data suggests this season's vaccines are a poor match. Data published last month from Canada found that vaccines looked to be 54% effective against H3N2 strains there.

""That's actually pretty good effectiveness for H3. Usually it's down in the 30 to 40[%] range,"" Petrie said.

Scientists in the Canadian report said that a better-matched, updated vaccine strain might explain the higher vaccine effectiveness they found. **But they also cautioned that some worrying mutations to H3N2 had also been spotted so far.**

""Potential impact on VE [vaccine effectiveness] elsewhere and through the rest of the season requires further monitoring,"" they wrote.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740494499.0,Here’s what a measles outbreak looks like: Why the return of measles is a public health tragedy.,"Thanks to successful vaccination campaigns, most Americans today have never experienced a measles outbreak. So when they see news that rural West Texas has recorded 90 cases within the past month, the largest spike in the state in nearly 30 years, they might not understand why it’s so alarming.

Here’s why: Measles is notoriously difficult to control. The virus is airborne and can linger in the air and on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. It is so contagious that 9 out of 10 unvaccinated children who are in contact with an infected person will fall ill. This is why cases are expected to multiply in the coming weeks. An outbreak has already been declared in neighboring eastern New Mexico, where nine people have been diagnosed thus far.

The virus can also have devastating consequences, particularly in young children. That parents have to discover this the hard way when they have access to a safe and effective vaccine is a public health tragedy.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the disease was a fact of life. It sickened 3 million to 4 million Americans a year, and nearly every child was infected before age 15. The initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu: high fever, runny nose, cough and red, watery eyes. A few days later, tiny white spots appear inside the mouth, followed by a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body, arms and legs.

Most measles patients will fully recover, but complications are common, affecting 3 in 10 who fall ill. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people need hospitalization. As many as 1 in 20 children develop pneumonia, and about 1 in 1,000 end up with brain swelling that can lead to seizures, deafness and permanent disability. Between 1 and 3 of every 1,000 children infected will die.

Even those who appear to have recovered might not be out of the woods. Measles can wipe out the immune system’s memory of past illness, leaving people susceptible to other pathogens. It can also cause a rare but terrifying illness, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, seven to 10 years after infection, especially among children who contract measles before age 2. Early symptoms include poor school performance and temper tantrums. In time, children develop uncontrollable jerking movements, speech and intellect deterioration, difficulty swallowing and blindness. There is no cure for this condition, which is nearly always fatal within three years.

In the United States, these horrific consequences have been relegated to the history books because of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Two doses of the shot are 97 percent effective at preventing measles. The high effectiveness also means that it’s possible to reach herd immunity — when immunity levels are so high within a population that it becomes difficult for a pathogen to spread. For measles, that level is 95 percent or above. This was achieved 25 years ago, when the United States officially declared measles eliminated.

These hard-won gains have been slowly eroding. Nationally, vaccination coverage among kindergartners decreased from more than 95 percent during the 2019-2020 school year to less than 93 percent in 2023-2024.

Many pockets of the country have significantly lower vaccination rates. In Gaines County, Texas, where most recent measles cases are clustered, nearly 14 percent of K-12 students have opted out of at least one required vaccine. Health officials say the portion of unvaccinated people there is probably higher because of the area’s large, isolated Mennonite population, whose data are underrepresented in official statistics.

Thus far, 16 measles patients have been hospitalized in Texas. Across the border in New Mexico, state officials put out public notices that people could have been exposed to the virus in an elementary school, a grocery store, an emergency room, a pharmacy and a church. Public health leaders in both states are educating the public on measles symptoms and setting up immunization clinics to try to curb the spread.

Time will tell how many more people will become infected and fall seriously ill in this outbreak. What’s certain is that this outbreak will not be the last. At least 15 states have proposed legislation to loosen vaccine requirements. In Texas, lawmakers have already introduced more than 20 such bills this year. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, refuses to disavow the debunked theory that MMR is linked to autism. And among the several thousand Department of Health and Human Services employees terminated in Elon Musk’s purge of government agencies are those tasked with disease investigation and outbreak response.

It’s been said that vaccines are a victim of their own success. Indeed, younger generations fail to appreciate the extraordinary benefit of vaccines because they have never seen the lethal illnesses that vaccines help avert. One can only hope that parents learn this lesson before more children are infected and suffer the consequences of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

The largest measles outbreak in decades has reached San Antonio, New Braunfels and San Marcos, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Officials say an individual who tested positive for the virus in West Texas traveled to two major universities and one of the nation’s busiest tourist attractions — the San Antonio River Walk.

Comal County public health officials also report the individual stopped in at a large New Braunfels travel center.

The Houston Health Department on Jan. 17 reported the city’s first measles cases since 2018 — two adults living in the same household who had traveled internationally. The department also released a list of nine possible exposure locations in Houston spanning from late December to early January, but as of Monday had not announced any additional cases in the city.

Possible recent exposure locations in the Austin and San Antonio area are as follows:

Friday, February 14th:

Texas State University in San Marcos from approximately 3-7 p.m.
Twin Peaks restaurant in San Marcos from 6-10 p.m.
Saturday, February 15th:

The University of Texas at San Antonio Main Campus between 10 a.m.-2 p.m.
San Antonio River Walk attractions— Wax Museum, Ripley's Believe It or Not and Ripley's Illusion Lab between 2:30-5:30 p.m.
Mr. Crabby’s Seafood and Bar in Live Oak between 6-8 p.m.
Sunday, February 16th:

New Braunfels Buc-ees between 9 a.m.-noon.
Health officials say anyone at these public locations during these times or up to two hours afterward should monitor for symptoms.

The individual lives in Gaines County, which is the epicenter of the West Texas measles outbreak that has produced at least 90 confirmed cases of the highly contagious infectious disease — the worst measles outbreak in 30 years.

Gaines County had the highest unvaccinated rate in the state this school year at 18 percent, according to state health data.

“Measles is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. If you think you may have been exposed or are showing symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider immediately,"" said Dr. Anita Kurian, deputy director at the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District.

Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000. This was achieved through a successful vaccination program that ensured high levels of immunity in the population.

""Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. We urge everyone to ensure they are up to date on their vaccinations to protect themselves and those around them,"" Kurian said.

“Protecting our community from measles starts with staying informed and taking the necessary precautions,” she added. “We encourage everyone to review their vaccination status and seek medical advice if they suspect exposure. Early detection and vaccination are key to preventing the spread of this preventable disease.”

Public health officials recommend those who may have been exposed take the following steps:

Review their immunization and medical records to check if they are protected against measles. Those who have not had measles, or the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine may not be protected and should consult a healthcare provider about getting vaccinated.

Contact their healthcare provider if they are pregnant, have an infant, or have a weakened immune system, regardless of their vaccination history.

Monitor for symptoms such as fever or an unexplained rash from 4 to 21 days after exposure.

If symptoms appear, stay home, and avoid school, work, and large gatherings. Call a healthcare provider right away. 

Do not enter a healthcare facility without first notifying them about your measles exposure and symptoms so you do not expose other patients.",1ix9m0e,https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/health-science/2025/02/24/514586/measles-alerts-issued-in-san-antonio-new-braunfels-and-san-marcos-as-texas-outbreak-spreads/,831
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740509201.0,AG Secretary says USDA’s strategy to control avian influenza is expected this week,"Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins says the USDA will unveil the department’s plans to address highly pathogenic avian influenza this week. She tells Brownfield it will be a multi-pronged approach. “It looks to include more biosecurity and greater aid to our farmers,” she says.  “We’re also looking at ways that we could perhaps even prevent the depopulating entire flocks and still considering the vaccine, although likely not required.”

Rollins, who spoke to Brownfield while en route to a Texas poultry facility, says the department is also considering importing eggs to address consumer cost issues.

She says the administration is working alongside state ag officials and farmers to provide a long-term fix. “A lot of them (farmers) don’t think they should be having to depopulate their entire flocks in the states that are hardest hit, like Iowa and Ohio and other states around the country,” she says.  “So, we’re working alongside those farmers to build smart perimeters to ensure we’re containing the virus. At the same time, approaching this, perhaps in a little bit of a different way.”

Rollins says HPAI remains a top priority for USDA’s Chief Veterinary Officer.  “She’s really working day in and day out on this alongside the other state veterinarians around the country,” she says.  “Ensuring we’re getting that feedback from all the above.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740445158.0,COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution,"In the early, uncertain days of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists delivered one comforting pronouncement: The virus that caused COVID mutates rather slowly. If that remained true, the virus would not change much to become more dangerous soon, and any vaccine could provide years of durable protection.

What actually happened was that SARS-CoV-2 began mutating quickly, first to be more transmissible and then to evade our immunity, causing breakthrough infections and reinfections. Five years and an alphanumeric soup of variants later, most of us have gotten COVID at least once. The vaccine is still being updated to match new circulating variants. And the virus itself is still changing.

In truth, scientists were both right and wrong about the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates. The rate of mutations as this virus jumps from person to person is indeed unimpressive. But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.

And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than 50 mutations—an astounding evolutionary leap. Omicron looked like it had achieved four or five years’ worth of expected evolution in just months, Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, told me at the time. These mutations enabled Omicron to cause a massive wave of infections even among the vaccinated.

Scientists now believe that chronic infections in immunocompromised patients are a key driver of variants in Omicron and beyond. Even as COVID surveillance has faded in urgency, researchers are watching chronic infections for signs of what’s to come.

In retrospect, clues were there from the beginning. At the start of the pandemic, researchers in New York, including Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, began sequencing viruses from cancer patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March and April 2020—and then kept testing positive for up to two months. The patients couldn’t clear the virus because their immune systems had been weakened by disease and by cancer treatments they received. The study, published in December 2020, concluded that immunocompromised patients with COVID might need long isolation periods, lest they unwittingly spread the virus. (These chronic infections in people who are immunocompromised are distinct from long COVID, which doesn’t necessarily involve continual shedding of virus.)

That same month, a preprint from a group led by Ravindra Gupta in the U.K. connected more of the dots. Gupta and his colleagues had found an immunocompromised patient with a lingering infection who was treated with antibodies from COVID survivors, only for the virus to acquire curious new mutations. 

Two mutations in particular gave the virus a slight edge in infectivity and antibody evasion. An immunocompromised host, the authors suggested, could provide the ideal viral training ground: A weakened immune system cannot wipe out the virus but can put up just enough defense for the virus to learn its tricks. In this case, the infused antibodies from COVID survivors likely contributed to whatever defenses the patient himself had, but even together they were not enough to completely clear the infection.

The virus from that particular patient probably didn’t spread far, if at all; most do not. But countless chronic infections all around the world subjecting the virus to similar immune defenses could ultimately lead to the same battle-tested mutations showing up over and over again. Indeed, mutations similar to the two in the U.K. patient soon showed up in variants such as Alpha and Omicron that did sweep around the world, Gupta told me recently. And in 2021, multiple alarming variants were found to have a different mutation that researchers in New York first observed in immunocompromised patients way back at the beginning of the pandemic. (Researchers at Mount Sinai, led by van Bakel and Viviana Simon, did match a minor variant from an immunocompromised patient to other infections in the New York City area, though it didn’t seem to spread much beyond that.)

None of the more notorious COVID variants has been directly traced to a single immunocompromised patient. But indirect evidence has accumulated over time that many variants do develop this way. Chronic infections, scientists have now observed over and over, create a distinct pattern of mutations: an overabundance of changes in the spike protein (which helps penetrate human cells) but not in the rest of the virus. This pattern is clearly found in both BA.1 and BA.2 versions of Omicron, as well as the variant that gave rise to JN.1, which drove last winter’s COVID surge. Bloom now says he has “very high confidence” that these variants came from chronic infections. The evidence is not as clear with other variants, he told me, but they could very well have evolved in the same way.

Long before COVID, Bloom had tracked the evolution of influenza during chronic infections in four immunocompromised patients; some mutations in these patients eventually showed up in the seasonal flu. I wrote about the study when it was published in 2017, intrigued by the possibility that chronic infections could predict changes in flu from year to year. At the time, this was quite a novel idea.

Flu and COVID evolution do differ in important ways, but chronic COVID infections, too, are now being examined as harbingers of the future. “Those will actually teach us a lot about the future tricks SARS-CoV-2 will come up with,” says Simon, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. To discover what those might be, she and van Bakel are now leading a research project to create better tools for sequencing chronic infections and to better understand which immunocompromised patients are most at risk for carrying them. What they find could be a preview for the future of COVID.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740440804.0,"Two people in US hospitalized with bird flu, CDC reports: Wyoming woman still in hospital while Ohio man released after facing ‘respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms’","Two people, in Wyoming and Ohio, have been hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a routine flu update on Friday.

The person from Wyoming is still in hospital, while the Ohio patient has been released, according to the report. Both patients experienced “respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms”, the report said, without detailing those symptoms.

This shows that H5N1 can be very severe and we should not assume that it will always be mild,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.

The news comes amid one of the worst seasonal flu outbreaks in 15 years – raising the potential for the emergence of a more dangerous virus that combines bird flu and seasonal flu in a process called reassortment.

I am very worried about H5N1 in patients that are being treated in hospitals where there are also many seasonal flu patients because this creates opportunities for reassortment, which could potentially produce a pandemic-capable H5N1,” Rasmussen said.

These are the first human H5 cases detected in Wyoming and Ohio.

An “older” woman from Platte county, Wyoming, was hospitalized in another state, according to a statement from the Wyoming department of health. She “has health conditions that can make people more vulnerable to illness”, the statement says. 

The woman was exposed to poultry in a backyard flock that tested positive for H5N1, the CDC report said, adding that she remained hospitalized at the time of the report.

A man in Mercer county, Ohio, was infected while depopulating, or killing, H5N1-positive poultry at a commercial facility, according to a statement from the Ohio department of health.

The man has been discharged from the hospital “and is now recovering at home”, the CDC report said.

So far, there have been 70 confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US since it was first detected in cows last year.

There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this point. The majority of cases have been among people who have close contact with animals.

Previously, a patient in Missouri was hospitalized and tested positive for bird flu after no known exposure. And a man in Louisiana was hospitalized and died after exposure to backyard chickens and wild birds.

A 13-year-old girl was also extremely ill and in the hospital for months in British Columbia after no known exposure.

The Louisiana and BC cases were both caused by a variant of H5N1 that emerged in the fall and has quickly become dominant in birds – and has now spilled over, separately, into dairy cows in Nevada and Arizona.

The new spillovers come as the Trump administration weighs a strategy that wouldn’t seek to contain outbreaks in poultry through depopulation.

The new head of health agencies, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has reportedly stopped a seasonal flu vaccine campaign. A scheduled meeting of the CDC’s independent vaccines committee has also been postponed.

A new study, published by the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, offers some insight into why some cases may not be as severe as others.

Researchers infected ferrets with H1N1 and then, three months later, infected them with H5N1 or H7N9, a low-pathogenicity variant.

H1N1 was the swine flu responsible for the 2009-10 epidemic. It never went away – in fact, it’s one of two seasonal variants behind this year’s flu season.

The ferrets with recent H1N1 antibodies were able to neutralize H5N1 more quickly than H7N9, indicating some protectiveness from the previous infection.

Another new study in the same journal found that ferrets first infected with H1N1 had less severe disease from H5N1 – suggesting that some humans may experience the same, the authors wrote.

“This is evidence that prior H1N1 infection or vaccination may provide some level of cross-protection via anti-N1 immunity,” Rasmussen said.

But it’s not clear to what degree that protection might help people.

“We shouldn’t interpret this to mean protection will be absolute in the human population,” Rasmussen said.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740407416.0,"Measles, ACIP, flu campaign, bird flu, and telehealth ending (via Your Local Epidemiologist)","Happy Monday! A lot is going on in the world of public health. Here’s some health news you can use to start your week.

**Your national disease report: Flu, flu, go away**

There are a ton of sick people out there, but we are finally getting a reprieve. The number of people with “influenza-like illnesses” (defined as a fever, cough, or sore throat) took a dive this past week.

Flu is the main culprit and follows similar patterns—it’s high but has started retreating. Regardless, flu hospitalizations this year have already surpassed the last “very bad” flu season in 2017-2018.

It seems like a bad time to stop a flu vaccine campaign. Alas, the new HHS administration is discontinuing the “Wild to Mild” flu campaign on Wednesday. CDC has been using images to emphasize how vaccination can help control flu symptoms, which I appreciate because they better reflect the purpose of vaccines (avoid severe disease, not prevent infection).

RFK Jr. wants a campaign focused on “informed consent.” Informed consent is always important, and the flu vaccine can have a very rare safety signal depending on the season. But the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Conflating the two could significantly impact uptake.

**What does this mean to you?** It’s not too late to get your flu shot. The flu season is notorious for having a long tail.

**Measles is coming in hot**

All eyes are on a Texas outbreak that is out of control. Here’s the breakdown:

Cases have risen to 90, with 16 hospitalized. The vast majority of cases are unvaccinated and school-aged.

This outbreak started in a tightly knit, unvaccinated pocket—specifically, a Mennonite community—but has now spread to five counties.

This region has a low vaccination rate—one in five students is not vaccinated for measles, mumps, or rubella (MMR).

**How bad is this going to get?** No one knows. But, as a fantastic epidemiologist pointed out, an increase of 32 cases in three days means the “force of infection” is strong. In other words, this is spreading exponentially, leading to more cases.

Another outbreak (9 cases) is growing in a neighboring county in New Mexico. An epidemiological link to the Texas outbreak hasn’t been made yet, so this may be a coincidence (although it’s hard to imagine it is).

An outbreak in New Jersey (3 cases) is also being closely monitored, particularly because hospital exposure could accelerate the spread.

How quickly each of these gets under control greatly depends on the state and local health departments’ ability to respond quickly and effectively. This relies on the public’s willingness to cooperate in case interviews, people’s willingness to get vaccinated, and available resources and support.

**What does all this mean to you?**

If you are in an area with an outbreak:

Pay attention to local public health department communication, including areas where cases have been to avoid measles exposures.

If you have a child under 12 months old, they can get a vaccine early (at 6 months). Talk to your pediatrician.

If you’re up to date with vaccines, you are very well protected (although the vaccines are not perfect).

If you’re not in a hot zone:

Reconsider travel to West Texas, especially if you have a baby under 12 months, because they have no protection against measles.

If you were born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968, getting another dose is a good idea. You got an older vaccine that used an inactivated virus, which doesn’t work as well.

You can check your MMR titers (not all immune systems that get two doses of MMR get activated). This can be more expensive than just getting another vaccine, but if you do have low titers, it could help with insurance coverage.

**ACIP vaccine meeting delayed: Lookout for two things**

ACIP—the external CDC advisory committee for U.S. vaccine policy comprised of pediatricians, scientists, and parents—was scheduled to meet this week, as they do every February. However, HHS postponed this meeting to an undefined date to allow for public comment.

This is the first time ACIP has been delayed. While allowing sufficient time for public comment is required by law before this committee meets, HHS has had since Feb. 3 to open for public comment. And it’s still not open.

This may reflect a chaotic administration transition. Another possibility, which I think is more likely, is that RFK Jr. is buying time to restack the ACIP committee roster to include people more aligned with his warped vaccine views. Politico reported that RFK Jr. plans to replace members who he perceives to have conflicts of interest. This is curious: ACIP members already disclose their COIs publicly, which is designed to prevent COIs from influencing decisions. ACIP has long been the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness. 

I’m certain misleading and inaccurate information about current ACIP membership will be made. As this unfolds, look out for two common tactics used to promote falsehoods:

Context removal: Misleading narratives may frame these disclosures as evidence of corruption rather than a safeguard against it. A COI from 30 years ago is much different from a current COI. Blurring the line erodes trust.

Attack on expertise: The overlap between medical and scientific professionals and pro-vaccine positions is nearly universal—because vaccines work. But expect to see this expertise reframed as bias or even conspiracy, like: “Of course all these people support vaccines, they’re part of the same system!”—ignoring the fact that their support comes from overwhelming evidence, not collusion. Undermining trusted experts makes space for less qualified voices to shape policy and public perception, often to the detriment of public health.

What this means to you today: We won’t get updates on many things, like how the flu vaccine is holding up, how antibodies should be used to keep babies from dying from the RSV virus, which travelers should receive a new vaccine against Chikungunya (which causes very bad joint pain), and more. A lack of transparent, open, and honest information about vaccine safety means communities can’t make their own informed, data-driven choices.

**Bird flu (H5N1) and egg prices up**

Egg prices continue to skyrocket due to the bird flu pandemic ravaging poultry farms. The average cost for a dozen eggs is now slightly over $8.00.

Given pressure, the new administration has suggested some policies, like vaccinating and medicating poultry and quarantining sick flocks. Like any policy, though, there are important considerations. I outlined them on PBS NewsHour last week:

A new publication from CDC (after being delayed for 4 weeks) found a transmission pathway (humans -> house cats). In these cases, cats were exposed to dairy workers with H5N1 symptoms. Cat-to-human transmission has also been documented in the past with avian influenza.

Should you worry about your cats? Farm cats are at high risk (drinking raw milk). Risk to house cats is very low on the list of things anyone should worry about at this point. But don’t serve your cats raw pet food. There have been a couple of outbreaks of cats now linked to raw pet food.

**Heads up: Medicare will stop covering telehealth in April.**

If you’re on Medicare and have leveraged convenient telehealth appointments, that’s about to end.

Medicare originally expanded its coverage of at-home telehealth services during the Covid-19 emergency, which was an important move to protect seniors and has become a critical service for those in rural communities.

As part of the deal to keep the government open in December, Congress proposed a bill to extend telehealth coverage for two years. However, Elon Musk struck down that bill; the ultimate package that kept the government open only extended coverage through March 31.

The change doesn’t apply to all telehealth services: for those in urban areas, monthly home dialysis visits for end-stage renal disease, acute stroke, and mental/behavioral health visits can still occur via telehealth. For those in rural areas, people must be at a healthcare facility to access telehealth services.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740433353.0,New coronavirus found in bats is not currently 'concern to public health': CDC,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday that the new coronavirus found in bats is currently not a cause for concern.

There is no reason to believe the virus poses a threat to public health at the moment and no infections have been detected in humans, according to the federal health agency.

""CDC is aware of a publication about a new bat coronavirus, but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The publication referenced demonstrates that the bat virus can use a human protein to enter cells in the laboratory, but they have not detected infections in humans.""

Chinese researchers, including from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Guangzhou Medical University, published a paper in the journal Cell on Friday indicating they had discovered a new bat coronavirus that could have the potential to infect humans.

The newer coronavirus is known as HKU5-CoV-2 and is a type of merbecovirus, which is the same family of another coronavirus known to infect humans called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

In a lab study, the new coronavirus was found to have the potential to enter cells through the ACE2 receptor, a protein found on the cells' surface.

This is the same way the virus that causes COVID-19 infects people, which theoretically means the new coronavirus could pose a risk to spilling over into humans.

The spike protein of the new coronavirus infected human cells that had high levels of the ACE2 receptor in test tubes, as well as in small models of human airways and intestines.

The researchers found that the virus did not enter human cells as readily as the virus that causes COVID-19 -- which is called SARS-CoV-2 -- writing that the ""risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.""

None of the animal studies that were conducted examined the virus's ability to cause disease or its transmissibility.

If the virus were to infect humans, the researchers suggested antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies -- laboratory-produced proteins that mimic the antibodies the body naturally creates when fighting a virus -- could be effective.

There are hundreds of coronaviruses circulating in nature. Only a few can infect humans, causing illnesses ranging from mild respiratory tract infections to more severe conditions such as bronchitis or pneumonia.

Coronaviruses include some variations of the common cold, the virus that causes MERS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the virus that causes COVID-19.

The researchers wrote that ""bats harbor the highest proportion of genetically diverse coronaviruses,"" posing a risk of spilling over into humans.",1ixdvx9,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/new-coronavirus-found-bats-concern-public-health-cdc/story?id=119118809,47
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740416940.0,"U.S. joins WHO-led flu vaccine meeting, despite planned withdrawal from agency","Two U.S. government agencies that are key players in the World Health Organization-led process to select the flu viruses for next winter’s influenza vaccines are participating in a meeting to discuss the issue, despite the Trump administration’s plans to withdraw from the global health agency, sources told STAT.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not announce its plans to participate in advance but confirmed its role Monday in an email response to STAT.

“CDC will be actively participating virtually at the WHO vaccine consultation meeting for the recommendation of viruses for 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere vaccine this week,” CDC spokesperson Benjamin Haynes said.

The weeklong meeting began Monday, with experts from both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration in virtual attendance. With the exception of Haynes, all sources who spoke with STAT for this article requested they not be identified by name because they hadn’t been authorized to speak. 

To attend the meeting, even virtually, the two agencies would have had to receive an exemption from the Trump administration due to its ban on all interactions with the WHO.

President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office announcing that the United States will withdraw from the WHO. And since the earliest days of the new administration, government agencies have been ordered to cease all dealings with the Geneva-based global health agency, and to halt the dispersal of all funding to it. 

The flu strain selection meeting, though, would have created a quandary for the administration. 
Twice a year, experts from around the world gather to determine which strains of flu should be in the next version of flu vaccines. The vaccines take months to make, bottle, and distribute, so these meetings typically take place toward the end of one flu season to prepare for the next.

This week’s meeting, for the 2025-2026 Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines, is being held at the Francis Crick Institute in London. The meeting for the Southern Hemisphere 2026 flu vaccine will be held in September.

In addition to making recommendations on the viruses seasonal flu vaccines should target, the group also reviews what is happening with flu viruses like H5N1 bird flu and other flu viruses that pose a pandemic risk. The goal of these discussions is to determine if existing candidate vaccine viruses — effectively seed strains with which to make vaccines to target these novel viruses — are still effective or should be updated. Some countries, notably the United States, make and stockpile supplies of vaccines to use in the event that some of these flu viruses circulating in birds or animals begin to transmit among humans.

The decisions are made by experts from seven WHO collaborating centers on influenza and four essential regulatory laboratories, located in Australia, China, Japan, Russian, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The CDC is one of the collaborating centers and the FDA one of the essential regulatory labs, giving U.S. government scientists two of the 11 votes — though decisions are made by consensus rather than straight votes. 

The CDC stopped contributing influenza data to two WHO-managed databases, FluNet and FluID, on Jan. 24, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic threat management, said recently. Data from earlier in the flu season had already been shared, but in a process designed to predict what’s going to happen months from now, the viruses that are circulating now are more relevant than reports on what circulated months ago.

The ban on interacting with the WHO left in doubt whether the CDC and FDA scientists would be allowed to attend the strain selection meeting, which in turn raised questions about how the FDA would instruct suppliers of flu vaccines for the U.S. market what it believes next winter’s shots should target. 
The FDA typically holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to go over the discussions that arose at the WHO strain selection meeting and finalize choices for the vaccines to be used in this country. It is currently unclear whether VRBPAC will meet next month. Many meetings of advisory committees have been canceled or postponed without rescheduling, since the new administration took office, including one of the CDC’s advisory committee, which was meant to meet this week. There are no upcoming VRBPAC meetings listed on the FDA’s website.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740403427.0,Australia: There’s an outbreak of melioidosis in north Queensland. Here’s what to know about this deadly ‘mud bug’,"Seven people have now died from melioidosis in flood-ravaged north Queensland this year.

Dozens of cases have been reported in the state in recent weeks, which experts have described as unprecedented.

So what is melioidosis, and why are we seeing a spike in cases now?

Melioidosis is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bug which normally lives harmlessly in soil and freshwater. But it can be dangerous when it infects humans or animals.

**B. pseudomallei – sometimes called the “mud bug” – enters the body through cuts or scratches.** It can also be breathed in and enter the lungs via small airborne water droplets, or by drinking affected water.

Symptoms usually develop within one to four weeks after a person has been infected. The disease can cause either local infections, such as chronic skin ulcers, or, more commonly, a lung infection which can lead to pneumonia.

Symptoms of the infection include fever, headache, trouble breathing, chest and muscle pain, confusion and seizures. In rare cases the disease can enter the bloodstream and cause septicaemia.

Treatment involves receiving intravenous antibiotics in hospital for several weeks followed by up to six months of oral antibiotics.

**How common is it?**

Diagnosis is usually conducted using a specialist bacterial culture. This is where a sample isolated from the patient is grown in a petri dish to identify the bacteria, which can take several days.

**Globally, around 165,000 cases of melioidosis are reported annually, and 89,000 deaths.** The majority of cases occur in southeast Asia, particularly Thailand.

Because similar symptoms can be caused by so many other diseases, melioidosis is commonly misidentified, meaning reported case numbers are probably far lower than the actual number of infections.

Also, cases often occur in remote communities and resource-poor settings, which can mean they’re less likely to be diagnosed.

**The disease is thought to be endemic to northern Australia.** It usually infects about 0.6 per 100,000 people annually in Queensland, which would be equivalent to around 30 people.

In the Northern Territory, around 17 people per 100,000 are infected annually, which would be equivalent to about 42 cases. However, this data is several years old.

In Australia, melioidosis is often treated before fatalities occur. The mortality rate has been estimated at less than 10%.

More people die from the disease in lower-resource countries with poorer diagnostic capabilities and hospital facilities. **In Thailand the mortality rate is estimated to be around 40%.**

**Who is at risk?**

Anyone can get melioidosis, but certain people are at higher risk. This includes people with diabetes, liver and kidney disease, cancer, or other conditions which might compromise the patient’s immune system.

In Australia, the disease is also significantly more common in First Nations people than among non-Indigenous Australians.

Once infected, people who are Indigenous, older or have chronic health conditions are at higher risk of poorer outcomes.

In the current outbreak in Queensland, at least three of the victims so far have been elderly. 

**What’s causing the current outbreak?**

Recent cases in north Queensland have been identified mainly around Townsville and Cairns.

Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service has recorded at least 41 cases since January 1, while more than 20 cases have been reported in Townsville in February.

This is most likely related to increased rainfall and flooding in and around these areas.

B. pseudomallei lives in soil and mud, and comes to the surface during periods of high rainfall. So recent heavy rain and flooding in north Queensland has likely increased the risk of melioidosis.

In the Northern Territory, 28 cases have been reported since the start of the rainy season last October. However this is lower than recent seasons.

**How can you protect yourself?**

If you’re in an affected region, you can protect yourself by limiting exposure to mud and water, and using appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves and boots if spending time in muddy areas. Cover any open wounds and wear a respirator if you’re working closely with water.

Monitor for symptoms and see a doctor if you feel unwell.

Several vaccines are in development for melioidosis, and experts have recently called for it to be recognised as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization.

Particularly seeing as increasing extreme weather events due to climate change may make melioidosis more common, hopefully we’ll see an increase in research into and awareness of this disease in the years ahead.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740345013.0,"More than 900 Californians have died from the flu so far this season amid low vaccine rates, state says","More than 900 Californians — including 15 children — have succumbed to the flu this season in what has turned out to be one of the worst surges of the respiratory illness in years, according to a report released Friday by the California Department of Public Health.

Most of the influenza victims — 701 — were over 64 years old, which tracks with the conventional notion that the illness disproportionately affects older people.

However, the number of children who have died has raised concerns. Four more kids died from the flu during the week ending Feb. 15, increasing the seasonal pediatric death toll by more than a third, according to the report.

With regard to COVID-19, “we just thought about older adults as getting sick,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. “We have to reset with flu. Because with flu, it’s not just the very old, it’s also the very young. And they can do very poorly.”

The 15 children who died from the flu this season includes four teenagers from San Diego. None of the teens — aged 14, 15, 16 and 17 — had received flu shots, according to health officials.

“These recent flu deaths among our youth are tragic and concerning as we head into what historically is the peak of flu season,” Dr. Ankita Kadakia, San Diego County’s interim public health officer, said in a statement this month.

Vaccination rates have declined, particularly among children, for the flu and other ailments, according to Chin-Hong.

Nationally, roughly 58% of children between 6 months and 17 were vaccinated against the flu during the 2020-21 season, declining to about 45% as of late January of this year.

**“In the world of vaccines, that’s like falling off a cliff,” Chin-Hong said.**

The trend is similar in California: 47.7% of California’s children have been vaccinated against flu as of late January, the lowest since at least the 2019-20 flu season. Last year at this time, 53.7% of children were vaccinated against flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone 6 months or older get a flu shot — ideally by the end of October to boost protection against the disease during high-circulation winter months.

The two types of flu generally circulating now are H1N1 — related to the swine flu strain that caused a flu pandemic in 2009 and 2010 — and H3N2, which “is notorious for just causing more serious illness in general,” Chin-Hong said previously.

Given how potent this flu season has already proved to be, officials say those who have yet to be vaccinated should consider doing so.

While flu activity remains high, it may be decreasing. California public health officials’ recent report shows a 3.4% decline in the rate at which flu tests returned positive results at the state’s clinical sentinel labs for the week ending Feb. 15, the most recent for which complete data are available.

Still, the test positivity rate sits at an elevated 23.3%. COVID-19 and RSV activity is low, health officials said, with positivity rates of 2.3% and 5%, respectively.
Chin-Hong said it’s not yet clear if the downward trend will hold.

“I think it’s too early to celebrate,” he said, adding that more data points are needed.

Flu season in the U.S. typically peaks between December and February, though the virus spreads year-round, according to the CDC.

Even if it’s on the decline, the virus is known for having a prolonged season, Chin-Hong said. It can run through April and sometimes later in the year.
“It’s not only the peak that we’re worried about,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s also the breadth of what’s happening this year.”

There were about 500 deaths last season from the flu by this point in time, and 600 the year before, the Mercury News reported.

**Chin-Hong estimates he hasn’t seen a death toll like that of this season in a decade.**",1iwknju,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-22/more-than-900-californians-have-died-from-the-flu-this-season-as-vaccine-rates-remain-low,215
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740318160.0,U.S. CDC reports five-fold increase in weekly measles cases,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday reported that measles cases so far this year had jumped to 93 from 14 a week ago, mainly driven by an outbreak in Texas.

An outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, where cases have now risen to 57 from 22 on February 11, has raised concerns over its spread to other parts of the state. Texas reported 90 cases overall as of Friday.

The Texas Department of State Health Services reiterated from last week that more cases of the highly contagious disease were likely to surface due to an outbreak in Gaines County.

The CDC said cases were reported from Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas.

It added that **95 per cent of the cases were in individuals who either had not been vaccinated or had an unknown status**, with **4 per cent of the total patients receiving one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, and none getting the two doses the agency recommends.**

Out of all the cases in the country, 28 were in children below the age of two, and 48 were in individuals between five and 19 years old.


*'Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year.** The virus can spread via travelers from countries where measles is common.

**The CDC said there have been three outbreaks reported in 2025. For comparison, there were 16 outbreaks during 2024, with a total 285 cases reported.**

In recent years, federal health officials have attributed some outbreaks to parents refusing to vaccinate children.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic, was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services last week, overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and some members of Congress.

Kennedy, however, has pledged to protect existing vaccination programs.",1iwaeta,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/us-cdc-reports-five-fold-increase-in-weekly-measles-cases/,784
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740248780.0,Alarm as bird flu now ‘endemic in cows’ while Trump cuts staff and funding,"A newer variant of H5N1 bird flu has spilled over into dairy cows separately in Nevada and Arizona, prompting new theories about how the virus is spread and leading to questions about containing the ongoing outbreaks.

The news comes amid a purge of experts at federal agencies, including employees who were responding to the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Department of Agriculture.

The additional spillovers are changing experts’ view of how rare introductions to herds may be – with implications for how to prevent such spread.

“It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained” on its own, said Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine.

The current outbreak is unlikely to end without intervention and needs close attention from the Trump administration to prevent the virus from wreaking more havoc.

Yet “we don’t seem to have a handle on the spread of the virus,” said Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease physician.

Bird flu’s continued spread is happening against the backdrop of the worst flu season in 15 years, since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009-10.

The spike in seasonal flu cases puts pressure on health systems, makes it harder to detect rare variants like H5N1, and raises the risk of reassortment, where a person or animal infected with seasonal flu and bird flu could create a new, more dangerous variant.

“There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala said. There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.

At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedly called for “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was also postponed on Thursday.

The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.

The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.

In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.

These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.

Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.

The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.

It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.

But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.

The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.

“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.

All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.

Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.

Blood tests on 150 veterinarians revealed three of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.

A study on two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.

Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.

Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.

Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.",1ivpe54,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump,626
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740232183.0,"Dr. Osterholm on Influenza, H5N1, and the Measles Outbreak in Texas (via Osterholm Update)","**On Influenza**

Dr. Osterholm: Well, Chris, influenza is absolutely everywhere right now and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere just yet. In our last episode, we discussed the double peak and flu cases for the first time since 2019-2020 flu season. We were also nearing historic levels for the percentage of outpatient visits for influenza like illness, at 6.9% of all outpatient visits. Since that episode, it hasn't stopped, and we're now at 7.8%, the highest level for influenza like illness and outpatient visits in more than 20 years. Levels are elevated across the entire country, but highest in the South. 35 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing very high levels of outpatient influenza like activity. Nine are high. Two are moderate. Two are minimal, and only one is low. Vermont still has insufficient data to estimate what's happening. The age breakdown of these outpatient visits has remained constant, with the youngest age group having the highest percentage and the lowest in the 65 and older age group. 

However, the school age kids 5 to 17 years old, have the highest percentage of ED visits for influenza than any other age group right now. There are more than 50,382 patients admitted to hospitals with influenza over the past week. **This is a 32% increase compared to our last episode with.** At that time, we thought it was really high. We now have the highest hospitalization rates in the 65 and older age group. Since our last episode, there have been additional 21 pediatric deaths, making that 68 for the season, contributing to the 16,000 deaths since the beginning of the flu season.

 Since our last episode. Flu deaths have actually outpaced COVID fatalities, with flu now accounting for 2.6% of deaths during the most recent week, compared to 1.5% for COVID. Now, as far as our vaccines are working, Chris, it’s tough to tell because we're still in the middle of the season. But there is a Canadian group, one very skilled in doing this work that performed a preliminary analysis based on specimens collected between October 27th, 2024 and January 18th of 2025. 

They estimated that the current vaccine is about 53% effective against H1N1 and 54% effective against H3N2. When I'm talking about effective, this means preventing someone having to actually seek out medical care, whether it be with a physician, an urgent care, or a hospital. So, think of that. The vaccine is still protecting you at least half the time against that kind of an event. Not a great vaccine in terms of perfection, but a darn good vaccine in terms of at least giving me some protection. So far this season, 48% of subtype specimens have been H1N1 and 51% have been H3N2, an amazing split right down the middle for these two viruses. Note that we've really seen no detection of any noticeable activity with H5N1, and I'll be talking more about that in a moment.

Historically, our flu vaccines have been anywhere from 19 to 60% effective. So the mid 50s is actually pretty good for what we have. We need improved flu vaccines, which is something I've said for decades. But for what we have now, I'll take 54% effective. And please note that our center continues to be actively involved in working towards getting new and better improved flu vaccines. I've talked about this before. We have what we call the influenza vaccine roadmap work that we're doing, and our goal is one day to get us a vaccine that has durable protection against all the different strains of influenza that might be seen in a given season, and with the idea that we get much, much higher protection. So let me just conclude by saying, yep, influenza is everywhere and it's not going away anywhere soon.

 This is proving to be truly a historic flu season for reasons we don't know why, but it surely is classified as a high severity season for every age group for the first time since the 2017-2018 season, please don't ignore this. Please don't. Get a flu shot yet, and please make sure your kids are vaccinated. It just isn't worth the risk. And although much of the flu season may be behind us, there are still a number of days ahead where a flu shot obtained now could still provide you with some very important protection.

**On H5N1 Human Cases**

Dr. Osterholm: Let me comment briefly on human cases. There have been additional human cases of H5N1 detected in the US over the last week. A patient from Wyoming but hospitalized in Colorado who was likely exposed to infected backyard poultry, and a patient in Ohio who was in contact with deceased poultry from an H5N1 commercial population. And third, a patient from Nevada who was exposed to infected dairy cattle while working on the farm. The CDC website currently reports 68 confirmed cases of human H5N1 infection in the US, though this figure comes from limitations that existed before and after the new administration took office. 64 of the 68 cases were detected through targeted H5 flu surveillance and four were detected through national flu surveillance. 

Finally, a CDC study that was delayed in publication due to the communication halt finally came out from CDC last week. It found that three of 150 sero-surveyed veterinarians working with dairy cattle across 46 states were positive for H5N1 antibodies, although none recalled having any symptoms. These findings imply that the current case count perhaps somewhat significantly, underestimates the actual number of spillover cases. **And what I mean by underestimates. I'm not talking about thousands or even hundreds necessarily, but it surely could be possible that we're seeing 2 to 3 times the actual number of cases in the community of infection versus ones we're picking up in clinical illness.**

**On Measles**

Dr. Osterholm: Well, Chris, these numbers are changing literally by the day. So, by the time anyone hears this particular podcast, they could have a significant increase in cases. But as of Wednesday, there were 58 measles cases reported so far in the Texas outbreak. Four have been unvaccinated people, and the rest were all in unvaccinated individuals or individuals with unknown vaccination status. 48 cases have occurred in children, six in adults and foreign individuals whose age is yet unknown. 13 of the 58 cases have been or are currently hospitalized at this time. This outbreak is occurring in a rural part of Texas where opposition to vaccines is common. In Gaines County, school children had an 18% vaccine exemption rate. 

This does not include their home-schooled children, who public health officials in the area speculate have even a higher rate of vaccine refusal. Many of the cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite population in Gaines County, which is highly under-vaccinated. I want to note that many of the measles cases have occurred in children who are home schooled, or who attend small private schools.

There is a narrative among many anti-vaccine groups that home schooled children, or those attending smaller private or charter schools, don't need vaccinations because they lack significant exposure to these harmful pathogens. This could not be further from the truth.

Viruses like measles are so highly contagious, and large schools and daycares are certainly not the only way to be exposed. All children, including those who are home schooled or go to very small schools, need these lifesaving vaccines. Local public health in Texas is responding. As of right now, 2000 additional doses of the MMR vaccine have been sent to the area with hopes of getting children vaccinated. Many potentially vaccinated children who were exposed to have received an additional dose to boost their immunity. Unfortunately, there has not been a large uptake of the MMR vaccine among the unvaccinated population in the Gaines County area. **Sadly, because of the low vaccine uptake and the nature of the measles virus, I expect that we'll see many more cases occur, both reported and unreported.**

This is not at all unexpected, considering the low vaccination rate and the lack of herd immunity in this area, but it is a tragic situation nonetheless. The MMR vaccine has an excellent safety profile, is highly effective, has prevented disabilities, and saved so many lives over the years. The fact that public health in our country is now being led by someone who has made a career out of discouraging this vaccine in particular, and spreading disinformation about it, is truly an unfortunate situation.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740156112.0,New Coronavirus Discovered in Chinese Bats Sparks Alarm,"A new bat coronavirus that has the capacity to spread to humans, similar to the one that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, has been discovered.

HKU5-CoV-2 was found by a Chinese research team led by virologist Shi Zhengli, known as ""Batwoman"" for her work on coronaviruses, especially at the Wuhan Institute, which has been at the center of the theory suggesting COVID-19 came from a lab leak—something Shi has denied.

Newsweek has contacted Shi for comment via email.

Why It Matters

Hundreds of coronaviruses exist but only a few can infect humans, including SARS, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).

This new one (HKU5-CoV-2) uses the ACE2 receptor to infect organisms—SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor for infection.

What is HKU5-CoV-2?

HKU5-CoV-2 is a coronavirus belonging to the merbecovirusgroup, which also includes the virus that causes MERS.

It has a higher potential to infect humans than other coronaviruses because of the way it binds to human ACE2, making it similar to SARS-CoV-2 and NL63 (a common cold virus).

Researchers came to this conclusion after using a technique called Cryo-EM, which uses a powerful microscope.

HKU5-CoV-2 was able to infect human cell cultures in the mini-human organ models the scientists used.

""Bat merbecoviruses, which are phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV, pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts,"" the study says.

What To Know

The research, conducted by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Guangzhou Laboratory and the Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, was published in the scientific journal Cell.

The study says that the potential for the virus to spillover into humans ""remains to be investigated.""",1iuv981,https://www.newsweek.com/new-coronavirus-bat-chinese-lab-2034232,1434

Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, and 16 people have been hospitalized so far, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Five cases included those who have been vaccinated.

A DSHS spokesperson previously told ABC News that this marks the largest measles outbreak in the state in more than 30 years.

Children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases with 51, followed by 26 cases among children ages 4 and under.

Gaines County is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 57 cases confirmed among residents, according to DSHS. State health data shows the number of vaccine exemptions in the county have grown dramatically.

Roughly 7.5% of kindergarteners had parents or guardians who filed for an exemption for at least one vaccine in 2013. Ten years later, that number rose to more than 17.5% -- one of the highest in all of Texas, according to state health data.

Meanwhile, in neighboring New Mexico, at least nine cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders Texas, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health told ABC News on Friday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has separately confirmed 14 cases in five states so far this year, which does not include the recent Texas or New Mexico cases or recently confirmed cases in Georgia.

Similarly to the local outbreaks, all of the nationally confirmed cases are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. Just one infected patient can spread measles up to nine out of 10 susceptible close contacts, according to the CDC.

Health officials have been urging anyone who isn’t vaccinated to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) shot.

The CDC currently recommends people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective.

In the decade before the measles vaccine became available, an estimated 3 to 4 million people were infected every year, according to the federal health agency.",1iuyxs2,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-90-cases-unvaccinated-people/story?id=119041244,303
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740149834.0,Trump administration yanks CDC flu vaccine campaign,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stopping a successful flu vaccination campaign that juxtaposed images of wild animals, such as a lion, with cute counterparts, like a kitten, as an analogy for how immunization can help tame the flu.

The news was shared with staff during a meeting on Wednesday, according to two CDC staffers who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, and a recording reviewed by NPR.

During the meeting, leadership at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told CDC staff that the Department of Health and Human Services had reviewed the campaign and advised that it would not continue.

The move comes during Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first full week on the job as head of HHS.

The ""Wild to Mild"" flu vaccination campaign sought to encourage people to get the flu vaccine. In particular, the campaign aimed to communicate that flu vaccination can lessen symptoms and the chance of getting severely ill, even if it doesn't prevent someone from catching the flu.

The Trump administration's decision to pull the campaign comes in the midst of a brutal flu season that's still raging. More than 50,000 patients were admitted to hospitals for influenza during the week ending Feb. 8, the highest level in 15 years.

Paid media for the ad campaign was ending on Wednesday, according to one of the current CDC staff members who spoke to NPR.

On Wednesday, the webpages for the ""Wild to Mild"" vaccination campaign were entirely offline. On Thursday a link came back online, but it now directs to a webpage with older material, rather than the previous pages that contained shareable images from the 2024 campaign.

The CDC didn't respond to a request for comment.

In an email to NPR Thursday, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, rejected the characterization of events: ""Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump's agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.""

Paid media for the ad campaign was ending on Wednesday, according to one of the current CDC staff members who spoke to NPR. The website for the ""Wild to Mild"" vaccination campaign remained offline offline as of Thursday afternoon.

Requests for comment to the CDC were not immediately returned.

Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, rejected the characterization of events: ""Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump's agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive,"" Nixon said in an email to NPR Thursday.

The campaign sought to ""reset public expectations around what a flu vaccine can do in the event that it does not entirely prevent illness,"" according to the CDC's webpage describing the launch of the campaign in 2023. It was renewed for the current flu season.

""We found that it was very successful—people understood the message, [and] they were swayed by the message,"" Erin Burns, associate director for communications in the CDC's Influenza Division, told the trade website Fierce Pharma in October 2024.

The campaign was a response to falling flu vaccination rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and targeted groups at higher risk, the CDC's launch webpage says, ""especially pregnant women and children.""

""The CDC campaign is a creative and effective way of conveying an extremely important public health message about 'partial protection' vs. 'complete prevention' of disease,"" Marla Dalton, executive director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told NPR in an email.

While it was primarily digital, the campaign also found a home in public transit over the fall. ""Wild to Mild"" branding was wrapped around trains in four major cities, and ads were featured at mass transit stations. According to a presentation from the CDC in November, those ads reached more than 30 million riders and generated another 30 million digital impressions by the end of October last year.

It's unclear how much time was left in the campaign, but it would have at least gone through the end of this flu season and the materials would have stayed on the agency's website, one of the CDC staffers told NPR.",1iussdu,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated,283
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740174849.0,"US flu still high, COVID low but elevated in some areas, RSV declining; Last respiratory disease update of the season, CDC says","US flu activity ebbed a bit but remained high and above the baseline for the 12th straight week last week, with more than 43,000 hospitalizations and 18 deaths, all of them children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its weekly surveillance report. 

The CDC also noted 18 new pediatric flu deaths and said it ""does not anticipate"" posting any more updates on respiratory disease activity this season.

COVID-19 levels are at low but elevated levels in many parts of the country, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are at moderate levels and declining, the CDC reported. The peak for COVID-related hospital demand was lower this season than all previous seasons and nearly 50% lower than last season's peak.

**High flu severity for all age-groups**

Flu test positivity was 26.9%, down from 31.6% the previous week, while outpatient visits dropped from 7.8% to 6.8%. Flu is high or very high in 44 jurisdictions in a season classified as high severity for all age-groups.

Of the 2,486 flu viruses public health laboratories reported, 96% were influenza A and 4% were influenza B. Among the 1,788 influenza A viruses subtyped, 62% were the 2009 H1N1 strain, 38% were H3N2, and none were H5, which would indicate avian flu.

>The CDC said it doesn't anticipate producing additional respiratory disease outlook updates for the rest of the season, but it's unclear if it will still post updates solely on flu activity.

The CDC estimates that, so far this season, 19,000 people have died from flu and 430,000 people have been admitted to hospitals.

The agency also confirmed 18 new flu-related deaths in children, bringing the total for the 2024-25 flu season to 86. Seventeen of those deaths were attributed to influenza A, and the other to influenza B. Of 12 fatal influenza A viruses subtyped, 9 were H1N1 and 3 were H3N2.

**Last respiratory disease update of the season**

The number of people seeking care for an acute respiratory illness was high last week, with very high activity in Delaware, Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. the CDC said. Test positivity for COVID-19 (4.5%) and RSV (6.6%) was comparable to last week's proportions.

Wastewater viral activity is high for influenza A, while it is moderate for COVID-19 and low for RSV. Other respiratory illness at high levels include pertussis (whooping cough), Mycoplasma pneumonia, and group A Streptococcus infections.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740102909.0,I'm a pediatrician working in the middle of Texas's measles outbreak. Here's what I want parents to know.,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer of Covenant Health Lubbock Service Area and Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas. It has been edited for length and clarity.

The children's hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where I work, saw its first measles case about a month ago. Since then, we've had about 16 children hospitalized. Most of them are having trouble breathing and need supplemental oxygen. Very high fevers are also a concern with measles, and about one in five unvaccinated people with measles need to be hospitalized.

I'm not just the hospital's chief medical officer; I'm also a pediatrician and mom of two teenagers. I'm lucky that they're older and vaccinated. Two doses of the measles vaccine prevent 97% of measles cases, so I'm not worried about them.

Still, it's a tough time for the community. Measles is highly contagious, so hospital staff must treat patients in special isolation rooms and wear N-95 masks.

I think we're still at the beginning of the outbreak, and we're going to see a lot more illness among unvaccinated kids over the next few months. With that in mind, here's what the community should know. 

**Measles is serious, yet parents shouldn't be overly concerned**

Measles is somewhat comparable to the flu, but it's more serious. There are short-term and long-term complications, including pneumonia, neurological complications, and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). According to the CDC, about three in 1,000 kids who contract measles die.

Despite that, parents of vaccinated children shouldn't be unduly concerned. The first dose of the measles vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months, and after that, children are 93% immune to the virus. After a second dose (given between 4 and 6 years), they're 97% protected. Even if there's measles at your school or day care, your vaccinated child is very unlikely to get it.

Because of that, parents don't need to worry about every sniffle. It's much more likely that vaccinated kids have a cold or the flu, which are also circulating in our community.

We're working closely with our local health department during this outbreak, and they're contacting people who may have been exposed to the virus. Call your pediatrician if you see the telltale rash associated with measles, which starts on the face.

**Vaccines are critical — even after exposure**

If you're exposed, it's not too late to get a vaccine. If a dose of the vaccine is administered within three days, you can still drastically reduce your chance of getting measles. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We're offering vaccination to as many unvaccinated people as possible, including the family members of hospitalized children.

We're also reaching out to people who are open to vaccines but may be a bit behind schedule to get them vaccinated as soon as possible.
We're emphasizing science and data, plus relationships

Vaccines can be polarizing, and there's no magic way to address communities that have strong anti-vaccine sentiments. As pediatricians, our job is to speak the truth about vaccines: they are safe and effective. We hope that families are willing to hear that.

What really helps is having an ongoing, open relationship between pediatricians and patients. That way, we can continue to have these conversations.
Infants are most at risk

It would be really stressful to have an infant in our community right now. I would keep infants out of the grocery store and crowded places as much as possible — though that's good practice during cold and flu season anyway.

Although the vaccine is usually given at 12 months, infants can get it as young as 6 months if they're exposed. If you're worried about your baby, call your pediatrician.

**I'm focused on compassion**

As a doctor, I treat patients and their caregivers with empathy and compassion. This situation isn't any different, even if measles is largely preventable. Not every family will make the decisions I might wish they would. I don't have power over that, but I have power over my ability to share the facts and deliver the best care possible.",1iufhma,https://www.businessinsider.com/pediatrician-working-in-the-middle-of-texass-measles-outbreak-2025-2,1059
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740145156.0,‘Beware of the bat’: how a mine in Kigali became the focus of Marburg virus research,"In a tin mine in a Kigali suburb, just 20 minutes’ drive from the heart of the Rwandan capital, the sounds of chittering and fluttering come from behind a padlocked door. It bears a sign: “Beware of the bat.”

The 10,000-strong bat colony in this tunnel harbours a deadly virus, and last year workers carried it out along with the rocks they mined.

Marburg virus disease killed 15 Rwandans in September and October 2024, infecting 51 more, and prompting international alerts.

Although the outbreak was declared over in December, Kigali hospitals still have posters on the walls alerting staff and patients to signs and symptoms. And in the mine, the padlocked door represents the first line of defence against another “spillover event” from bats to humans.

The source of Rwanda’s first Marburg outbreak was unclear at first. Officials knew only that patients in Kigali’s main hospitals were falling ill with worrying symptoms and dying, followed by the staff who had cared for them.

The symptoms of Marburg include fever, rash, chills, head and muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. It can progress to severe and fatal bleeding, but the symptom list overlaps with those of other diseases, including the malaria endemic to the region.

When laboratory tests confirmed Marburg as the culprit, an outbreak was formally declared on 27 September and public health experts swung into action. A team of clinicians and epidemiologists went back over more than 120 medical charts.

“They ended up identifying one suspicious case, a 25-year-old female, who was admitted [to an intensive care unit] during the end of August, and who presented with symptoms that are similar to Marburg virus,” says Dr Edson Rwagasore, head of public health surveillance and emergency preparedness and response at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC).

That patient had died – but further investigations revealed that her husband, a 27-year-old miner at the Gamico Mining Ltd site on the western outskirts of Kigali, had been ill at around the same time.

“We later identified that tunnel 12, where he actually worked, had bats roosting within that tunnel,” says Rwagasore. Further testing identified 14 people who worked in the tunnel with antibodies to Marburg – suggesting previous infection with the virus.

It all pointed to this specific site as the initial source of the outbreak, says Rwagasore, speaking at a newly established health clinic at the mine in mid-February.

The first scenario was, should we close the mining site? But closing the mining site means people will move to other sites. And then by doing that, we’ll be missing cases, we’ll be missing people who have already been exposed. And then you find yourself spreading beyond just one site,” he says.

Instead, miners were allowed to continue work and were screened for Marburg symptoms, while the RBC’s efforts to ensure no further “spillover” began.

Tunnel 12 has been all but closed – entry is only allowed for officials carrying out research and surveillance. But the rest of the site is a hive of activity.

Marburg virus is a viral haemorrhagic fever that comes from the same family of viruses as Ebola and Lassa fever. It was first identified in 1967, after European laboratory workers fell ill after handling biological material from African green monkeys, imported from Uganda.

Today, the Egyptian fruit bat – the species found in the Gamico mine – is recognised as the principal animal reservoir for Marburg and similar viruses. The bats don’t appear to get sick themselves, but can shed the virus in their urine, droppings or saliva. If humans or other animals come into contact with those, or with the bats directly, they may become infected.

In a bid to prevent fresh outbreaks, Rwanda’s health watchdog has established a new onsite clinic for any miners and their families developing certain symptoms, including fever, at the Kigali mine.

“With this kind of approach, we are assured that everyone who has symptoms will be identified as soon as possible and then linked to care,” says Rwagasore.

But the key intervention is establishing buffer zones “so the human activities are in different places compared to where bats are seen”. The same action is being taken in six other mines with similar risk profiles across the country.

After donning protective equipment including a hard hat and torch, hi-vis vest, boots and a surgical mask, Rwagasore walks down a road from the mine’s administrative buildings towards the tunnels.

He points to a fenced-off area up a small cliff, above the road. It surrounds the opening from which bats emerge at night to forage for food, preventing human entry. It is also covered by CCTV.

Further down the road, tunnel entrances that had been used by miners until last year’s outbreak are completely bricked up.

Research on the colony’s behaviour is continuing, including plans to put GPS trackers on some of the bats later in February to study their movements. Rwagasore says experts believed they were unlikely to move to other tunnels at the mine, preferring to stay where there is “no disturbance, no noise, nor any kind of interaction”.

He also hopes it will reduce stress among the bats, “actually also linked to more shedding of the virus”. There also seems to be seasonal variation in virus shedding patterns, with more happening between August and September, and between January and March, he says.

What proportion of the bats carry the virus is also a subject of research, with samples taken weekly.

The tunnel’s only entrance for the researchers doing that work, halfway down a cliff face, is reached via a steep path from the top.

To reach the bats means going through a red, locked gate bearing a sign: “Permanently closed.”

Our headtorches pick out something on the tunnel floor – a dead bat, with flies crawling over the corpse. We are advised to step carefully around it.

Then we move along a passageway until we reach a bricked-off section with a red, padlocked door. It is briefly opened to reveal a high, craggy-ceilinged chamber full of roosting bats. One flutters away from the light.

While there is no licensed vaccine or drug treatment for Marburg, during the outbreak, Rwanda used a candidate vaccine made by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in a bid to immunise people at higher risk against the virus. It also gave hospitalised Marburg patients Gilead Science’s remdesivir, an antiviral medicine. Miners at the Gamico site – particularly those who worked in tunnel 12 – were offered the vaccine.

Previous Marburg outbreaks have had fatality rates of up to 88% and an ongoing outbreak in Tanzania has killed 10 out of 10 infected patients to date. Rwanda has been praised for keeping its death rate down to 22.7%.

However, scientists warn that similar outbreaks are becoming more frequent and more likely, due to increased contact between humans and wild animals driven by rapid urbanisation.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740164402.0,"Can avian flu spread via the wind? Can't be ruled out, experts say","A non–peer-reviewed study published on the preprint server bioRxiv suggests that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus shed in poultry droppings can be transmitted by the wind, a possibility that other experts say can't be ruled out but is also very difficult to prove.

The report centers on a February 2024 outbreak of H5N1 avian flu among unrelated commercial poultry farms located about 8 kilometers (5 miles) apart in the Czech Republic during the 2023-24 HPAI season.

Since the latest H5N1 epidemic began in February 2022, the virus has led to the deaths of more than 150 million US birds.

**Ideal weather for transmission**

The cluster was identified after avian flu killed 5,000 fattening ducks within 2 days at a basic-biosecurity 50,000-bird farm near a lake frequented by wild ducks, the probable cause of the outbreak; the rest of the poultry were culled. A week later, deadly outbreaks with a slower disease course occurred at two high-biosecurity chicken farms, where dead birds were found mainly near the barns' air-intake vents; the entire population was culled. All farms had their own wells.

Experts hypothesize that the slower disease course in the chicken barns may be due to lower H5N1 transmissibility in chickens, waning concentrations of the virus over distance from the duck farm, or housing conditions.

The researchers, from the State Veterinary Institute Prague, used genetic, epizootiologic, meteorologic, and geographic data to reconstruct events suggesting that wind was the mechanism of H5N1 transmission between poultry on at least two of the farms. Three H5N1 strains collected from birds at all three farms were genetically identical, no large waterways were near the chicken farms, and the duck farm didn't share staff or contractors with the chicken farms.

Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation.
What's more, meteorologic data revealed a breeze in the direction of the chicken farms, cloudy conditions that could have kept the sun's ultraviolet light from killing the virus, and virus-supporting cool air. The team didn't conduct air sampling.

""Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation,"" the study authors wrote. ""They also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites.""

Airborne not only or major mode of spread
Lead study author Alexander Nagy, PhD, told CIDRAP News that he and his team became convinced about the role of windborne transmission in these outbreaks when they confirmed the identical identity of the H5N1 strain in the donor and recipient farms, the nearly ideal weather conditions during the transmission event, and the slow disease progression in the chicken barns characterized by feed and water consumption before clinical signs appeared.

""Additionally, the affected birds [dead chickens] were located in sections closest to the air inlets,"" he said. ""Finally, we excluded all other plausible explanations.""

Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News, said airborne transmission can be very important, ""meaning that that's the most logical explanation for when you have many barns with outbreaks in one geographic area where human biosecurity cannot be implicated as a reason for transmission.""

In the past, he said, the poultry industry has been reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission because of the implications it may have for its practices: ""The industry's reluctance to accept this possibility is not that dissimilar to what we saw with the lack of some in the medical and public health communities to recognize that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was also airborne.""

While the researchers did a very good job of laying out their hypothesis and supporting data, their conclusion should be interpreted with caution, said David Swayne, DVM, PhD, a poultry veterinarian who retired as an avian flu researcher with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Research Service.

""I think we, as veterinarians who deal with avian influenza and other infectious diseases, would acknowledge that there is some airborne—and I'll use the word dissemination—and that may lead to transmission,"" he said. ""But we have to be cautious to make sure people understand that it doesn't mean that it's the only way, nor that it's the major way. And each individual facility is going to be different.""

Montserrat Torremorell, DVM, PhD, chair of the Department of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, called the researchers' argument for airborne transmission ""compelling.""

""Meteorological conditions, timing of infection, housing conditions of the animals, susceptibility of the animal populations that became infected and the lack of other epidemiological links between the premises are supportive of airborne transmission in this case,"" she said in an email.

During an avian flu outbreak in Minnesota, Torremorell collected air samples inside and outside facilities housing three infected turkey and three egg-laying chicken flocks. Air samples from five of six flocks tested positive for large quantities of H5N1 virus, all of them in the active infection stage. The negative sample was from a flock in the advanced stage of depopulation.

""The larger number of positive samples were inside the facility and at the exhaust fan (~5 m [meters; 16 feet] away from the facility), and the number of positives decreased with distance, but even with that we identified some suspects (traces of RNA material) at about 150 m and 1 km [kilometer; roughly a half mile),"" she said. ""Viable virus (through virus isolation) was found inside the facilities, at the outside of the exhaust fan and at about 100 m.""

**Entry mechanism difficult to determine**

David Stallknecht, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine and a wildlife expert, said the study provides additional circumstantial evidence to several studies suggesting windborne viral spread. But he added that the mechanism of disease transmission into a poultry house is hardly ever identified, because there is no way to control for variables. 

""It basically says that it could have happened, and I would not dispute that,"" he said. ""But to actually come down with concrete proof like you would in an experimental controlled experiment, there's too much going on.""

""Influenza can be transmitted by a million different ways, probably many of them we don't even know about,"" he added. For example, whether the virus entered the poultry house via a raccoon, bird, person, or a person's shoes, ""those kind of details never really get resolved.
Stallknecht said he and his team tried to research water-based avian flu transmission associated with ducks. ""And we got to the point where we just had to quit because the numbers and the probabilities were so extreme,"" he said. ""You can't do an experiment to pick up a one-in-a-trillion event.""

Swayne said that moving equipment and people in and out of poultry barns has to be done at a very high level of biosecurity to prevent viral transmission: ""Yes, you could have movement of the virus by the wind, but it may be that it's tracked in to the barns by the contamination around the outside, either from wild birds depositing fecal material there as they eat, spilled feed off of grain silos, etc.""

He added that just because a virus is transported via the wind doesn't necessarily mean it will enter a barn that way. ""The virus can move on particles or water droplets by the wind for a distance, and then it could land and contaminate the environment.""

**Authors were initially skeptical, too**

Nagy acknowledged that airborne spread isn't typically considered a primary route of infection in poultry, and windborne spread requires ""a constellation of many specific conditions"" that behooves further research. 

""However, when all conditions align, windborne transmission becomes a feasible mode of spread and could play a more significant role than previously thought, especially in densely populated poultry areas,"" he said. ""The windborne route is important to consider in cases when the infection emerges in new locations without obvious links to other farms or when illness and mortality are first observed near the air inlets.""

Poultry operations typically consist of confined, mechanically ventilated buildings with high population densities, a situation unlikely to change. 

The windborne route is important to consider in cases when the infection emerges in new locations without obvious links to other farms or when illness and mortality are first observed near the air inlets.
Alexander Nagy, PhD

""The high demand for chicken meat and eggs, which continues to increase, does not leave much room for alternatives,"" Nagy said. ""Instead, it would be relevant to consider sterilization or treatment of the incoming air.""

Torremorell agrees, saying air filtration is already in use in the swine industry. ""Treating the air of poultry farms is not easy, because the volume of air to be treated is very large, but the industry should explore options on how to get it done,"" she said. ""Adapting air treatment methods for incoming and exhausted air requires research, investment, and willingness to make changes to current farming systems."" 

While the air ionization precipitators or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters could be installed, Swayne said they would be prohibitively expensive and difficult to maintain. ""Generally, the cost is so high that you would only consider that in certain types of operations,"" he said, such as those with high-value breeding stocks.

To try to eliminate the virus from a farm as quickly as possible, Stallknecht recommends extremely rapid diagnosis and keeping farms smaller, ""having 20,000 birds on a farm, or 40,000, rather than 1 million."" Swayne said farmers should bury infected birds in a closed pit to prevent scavenging and take care to not attract wild birds by spilling feed when transferring it from a truck to a silo.

""It is very important that farmers don't automatically default to blaming the air as the source of infection because overall the introduction of contaminated animals, fomites [contaminated inanimate objects], and people is likely to account for the larger amount of between herd transmission events,"" Torremorell said. ""Also, it's important to have training, compliance and auditing programs in place.""

The significance of any windborne H5N1 spread to poultry farms is unknown at this point, and the likely limited zoonotic potential—that between animals and people—of currently circulating viral variants means that the implications for public health are probably minimal, Nagy said. In addition, people would need a much higher dose of windborne virus than a bird to become ill, Stallknecht said.

The historical resistance to considering airborne viral spread, such as that encountered with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may be due to the usual focus on direct contact and fomites, or contaminated objects, Nagy said. Documented cases of windborne transmission are relatively rare, perhaps because demonstrating this kind of spread requires a combination of data that can be complex and resource-intensive to gather and analyze.

""To be honest, we were initially skeptical about this mode of H5N1 spread as well,"" he said. ""However, as the evidence has grown, our attitude has also changed.""

**H5N1 vaccine could stop viral transmission**

The study findings come as poultry farmers learned that they may get some relief from the avian-flu threat, after the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) conditional approval of a killed H5N2 vaccine to protect poultry. 

Countries such as China, France, Egypt, and Mexico already vaccinate their poultry against H5N1. But the USDA must still approve its use before farmers can vaccinate their flocks. 

But while H5N1 epidemics were for years ended by culling affected flocks, scientists fear that H5N1 is here to stay. If the virus is endemic, vaccination becomes even more important in preventing poultry infection and reducing viral shedding. Yet questions remain, such as the threshold for culling versus allowing the virus to burn itself out, a decision that Swayne said would likely be up to the USDA in consultation with state partners.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740091881.0,"RFK Jr. prepares shake-up of vaccine advisers, removing and replacing members","HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is preparing to remove members of the outside committees that advise the federal government on vaccine approvals and other key public health decisions, according to two people familiar with the planning.

Kennedy plans to replace members who he perceives to have conflicts of interest, as part of a widespread effort to minimize what he’s criticized as undue industry influence over the nation’s health agencies, said one of the people, who were granted anonymity to speak freely. Kennedy has long argued that drugmakers have too much sway over the approval of their products.

**The effort is likely to target the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which plays a key role in setting vaccine policy. Kennedy and his top aides are also scrutinizing a host of other outside panels, including those that advise the Food and Drug Administration.**

Kennedy has only just begun evaluating the advisory committees, one of the people cautioned, and has not decided who or how many people will be replaced, or set a firm timeline for the removals.

But should he follow through, the moves would likely generate upheaval within the Department of Health and Human Services and feed concerns across the broader public health establishment that Kennedy could undermine Americans’ trust in vaccines.

Prior to his confirmation as HHS secretary, Kennedy sowed doubt about the safety of vaccines as one of the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine activists. He has since denied that he is against vaccines, and during his confirmation hearings promised not to undermine the nation’s faith in immunizations.

The assurances he provided helped clinch his confirmation, after Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said he received commitments that changes would not be made to the CDC’s vaccine committee.

“If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes,” Cassidy said in a Feb. 4 Senate speech.

Still, Kennedy vowed during his aborted presidential campaign last year and in his Senate testimony to attack so-called conflicts of interest that he believes have influenced HHS’ policy and research priorities.

“We will remove conflicts of interest from the committees and research partners whenever possible or balance them with other stakeholders,” Kennedy said on Tuesday, in his first extended remarks to HHS staff.

Kennedy and his allies have long targeted ACIP as rife with conflicts of interest, though those on the panel and other public health experts have dismissed the criticism as misguided. The committee’s members are vetted for conflicts of interest and required to file regular disclosure reports.

The fresh scrutiny comes as a meeting scheduled for next week of the CDC’s external vaccine committee was canceled, according to a person familiar with the decision. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the meeting is being “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”

**The federal public comment portal for the meeting — which was set to be open from Feb. 3 through Feb. 17 — was never activated, a contributing factor to the postponement. The public historically has had an opportunity to comment on the meeting agenda and request time to make oral statements.**

“The ACIP workgroups met as scheduled this month and will present at the upcoming ACIP meeting,” Nixon said in an email.

He did not respond to follow-up requests for comment on Kennedy’s plans to shake up the outside advisory committees. A spokesperson for the CDC declined to comment.

The meeting would have been the first since President Donald Trump’s inauguration and Kennedy’s swearing-in as health secretary.

**A draft agenda for the meeting included votes on whether to recommend GSK’s recently approved meningitis vaccine and to include it in the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free shots to low-income kids.**

“Delays to ACIP processes and recommendations can prevent access to FDA-approved vaccines, putting people at risk from preventable diseases,” a GSK spokesperson said in a statement.

There was also a discussion scheduled for the HPV vaccine, a product known as Gardasil that’s the subject of personal injury litigation on which Kennedy has worked.

In a revised ethics pledge, the secretary said he would direct to his son any proceeds won from the lawsuit over Merck’s vaccine and to which he’s entitled through a referral arrangement with the law firm Wisner Baum.

ACIP is composed of up to 19 members who vote on whether, and how, to recommend vaccines for the public. Six representatives of federal agencies responsible for national immunization programs and 30 liaisons from groups with vaccine expertise also participate in committee meetings.

While the CDC director isn’t required to accept the group’s advice, they typically do.

ACIP recommendations for pediatric vaccines are enshrined in the childhood immunization schedule, a document that advises doctors on when to vaccinate kids against infectious diseases from polio to chickenpox. States, which are responsible for setting school vaccine mandates, tend to base their requirements on the schedule. 

All 50 states and Washington require certain vaccines for school attendance, though all permit exemptions for children with medical reasons to avoid shots, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. State laws allowing exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary, though more state lawmakers are pushing bills to relax vaccine mandates even as national immunization coverage falls.

A coalition of patients, providers and researchers posted a letter to Kennedy, Cassidy and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez on Tuesday calling on them to ensure a “prompt rescheduling” of the meeting.

“Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions,” they said in the letter, which was spearheaded by the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease. “This meeting should to be no different.”

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740074741.0,"Meeting of key CDC vaccine advisory panel, under scrutiny by RFK Jr., is postponed","A committee of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy — a group believed to be in the crosshairs of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — will not meet for its regularly scheduled February meeting, a senior HHS official confirmed Thursday.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was to meet from Feb. 26 to 28, its first gathering since the Trump administration took office. That will not happen, Andrew Nixon, the HHS director of communications, told STAT in an email. 

Nixon did not directly answer STAT’s query of when the meeting would be held instead, saying only that it is “upcoming.”
Kennedy, whose first day at HHS was Tuesday, has denounced the ACIP in the past. During his Senate confirmation process, he told the Finance Committee that 97% of ACIP members had conflicts of interest — a claim that people familiar with the rigorous vetting process ACIP members undergo have refuted.

The CDC staff that organizes the committee’s work has for weeks been trying to get final approval from HHS to hold the meeting, without success. Until last week, the subcommittees or work groups that do the preparatory work for meetings of the full committee had been barred from meeting due to the communications “pause” the administration placed on federal health agencies soon after President Trump’s inauguration. The subcommittee meetings were allowed to resume last week, multiple sources told STAT.

For a time, the CDC thought the ACIP meeting could take place, and in person on the agency’s campus, though plans were recently made to shift it to an online session as the secretariat waited for final approval to convene the meeting.

The meeting — the agenda for which has been online since early January — was to be held to discuss multiple vaccine issues, and to vote on recommendations for the use of a newly approved vaccine to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease; a new meningitis vaccine from GSK, to be marketed as Penmenvy; as well as new recommendations on influenza and RSV vaccines.
All advisory committee meetings where votes will take place must have a period for public comment. Members of the public can submit written comments, or ask to enter a lottery to be allowed to make a verbal comment during the meeting. 

But because HHS would not formally authorize the meeting to proceed, the portal through which public comments would be submitted was not opened. Sources said that this was the final trigger for the decision of the CDC’s ACIP secretariat to ask to postpone the meeting.

Nixon said in his brief email that the meeting would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”

Jean Kaseya, MD, MPH, Africa CDC's director-general, said the development increases the risk of spread within and beyond the province, including to neighboring countries. He added that four healthcare facilities in South Kivu have been destroyed and looted, and that the violence has displaced more than 153,000 people. 

Conflict and insecurity have interrupted mpox reporting in South Kivu province over the past 2 weeks, he added.

Mpox outbreaks have affected 22 African countries, and 13 are in the active phase. 

Cases are trending upward in 6 countries: Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Zambia, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, and the DRC. In the Republic of Congo, nearly 70% cases are among males, and clades 1a and 1b are co-circulating.

Kaseya said that, in the most affected countries, hot spots include capital cities, such as Brazzaville, Congo and Lusaka, Zambia.

Seven countries have received mpox vaccine shipments, and five are currently vaccinating. So far, more than 200,000 doses have been administered. Kaseya said another promising development is the decentralization of lab capacity.

**Waiting for clarification on US funding waiver**

Last week, officials said a pause in aid from the United States is hampering the transport of mpox samples to labs in some of the most affected counties, which officials said today includes Uganda. 

Kaseya said the US government has issued a waiver for humanitarian funds, but the situations for accessing the support haven't been clearly communicated to African countries. He said transportation of samples and vaccines are part of lifesaving assistance.

Also, at an African Union assembly that just concluded, leaders approved an African Epidemic Fund that is designed to streamline resources for preparedness and response in the region. Kaseya called the epidemic fund a ""game changer"" and said the African Union also made progress on an agenda for local drug and vaccine manufacturing and built support for innovating health financing.",1iuft9e,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/mpox-risks-rise-dr-congo-conflict-area-large-cities-other-nations,6
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740056965.0,"Thailand: Flu cases increase 10 times in 15 days, from 7000 cases to 99,000 cases.","Thailand's Ministry of Health warned that the number of people infected with flu in the country has increased dramatically, from more than 7000 cases to 99 000 cases in the past 15 days.

On 17 Feb 2025, Thai Health Minister Somsak Thepsutin said that the number of flu cases in February [2025] increased sharply. Health authorities are speeding up the provision of vaccines to vulnerable groups, especially children and the elderly, as the country enters flu season and schools reopen after the holidays.

**As of 25 Jan 2025, Thailand recorded 7819 cases of influenza. By 15 Feb 2025, the total number of infections had skyrocketed to 99 057, with 9 deaths.**

According to the Ministry of Health, most cases have been detected in schools, with children aged 5-9 being the most vulnerable group. The 4 provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima, Surin, Buri Ram and Chaiyaphum have been hit hard, with a total of 6900 patients. Mr. Somsak advised people with flu-like symptoms to stay home to avoid spreading the virus.

According to the Department of Disease Control (CDC), the number of flu cases in Thailand has been steadily increasing from about 472 000 in 2023 to 668 000 in 2024. Current trends suggest that this year's season will surpass last year's [2024], when there were nearly 100 000 cases from 1 Jan to 3 Feb 2024, much higher than the 47 000 cases during the same period the previous year [2023]. According to the Ministry of Health, H1N1 is the main strain of influenza virus currently circulating in Thailand.

Dr Yong Poovorawan, a virologist at Chulalongkorn University's faculty of medicine, recommends that travelers to countries in the Northern Hemisphere get a flu shot at least 2 weeks before going abroad.

However, he also called for calm, saying that flu is a seasonal disease and Thailand does not have the same variant that is raging in Japan.

""Influenza is seasonal. It spreads during the cold season in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres,"" Dr. Yong wrote.

**The flu situation in Japan has attracted the attention of public opinion in Thailand and Southeast Asian countries, when famous Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu died after contracting the flu earlier this month [February 2025].**

To reduce the severity of the disease and prevent death, people are advised to take basic measures such as covering their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer; and avoiding crowded, poorly ventilated places.

For all patients, including those with mild symptoms, rest at home for 3 to 7 or until fully recovered. Always wear a mask when in close contact with others, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands frequently.

The Thai Ministry of Public Health's health promotion and prevention plan focuses on promoting influenza vaccination. The vaccination campaign begins in May [2025], in line with the peak influenza season. The National Health Insurance (NHSO) plans to distribute 4.5 million doses of vaccine to health facilities.

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1740059719.0,Australia: Victoria Reports 3rd Outbreak Of HPAI H7N8,"Just days after declaring their 2024 outbreak over (see map above), on February 8th Victoria Reports A New Outbreak of HPAI (H7N8) - which is different from the two  HPAI H7 strains they reported in 2024.  

A week later (Feb 13th), Victoria announced a 2nd Poultry Victoria Poultry Farm with HPAI H7N8, and today they announce a 3rd. 

First today's announcement, after which I'll have more on the debate over culling infected poultry.

>Last updated 20 February 2025

>H7 avian influenza (bird flu) is confirmed at a third poultry property in northern Victoria. All infected properties are within the control area and under quarantine.

>Given the close proximity to existing infected properties, this new detection is not unexpected.

>Diagnostic tests confirmed a high pathogenicity strain of H7N8. The tests were done at CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong.

>This is a new outbreak and not related to the 2024 outbreaks in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The past outbreak was successfully eradicated.

What we are witnessing (repeatedly) in Australia (and in other countries) is the birth of new subtypes and genotypes of HPAI viruses in poultry.  While H7 viruses are viewed as slightly less dangerous than H5 viruses, the experiences with H7N9 in China and H7N7 in the Netherlands are not to be ignored. 

Simply put, LPAI (Low path) H7 or H5 viruses - which are ubiquitous in wild birds - make their way into a poultry flock, where they spread, evolve, and sometimes spontaneously mutate into highly pathogenic (HPAI). 

We've seen this happen repeatedly around the globe, including here in the United States (see map below). If left unchecked, one or more of these viral incarnations could eventually become a legitimate rival to H5N1.

**Which is why even LPAI H5 and H7 outbreaks are viewed as dangerous - and immediate culling is the  standard procedure - even though they may produce low mortality in poultry.  Allowing the virus to `run its course' - as many are currently suggesting - is the equivalent of running a Gain of Function study in a basement laboratory with little or no biosecurity.**

We've already seen (admittedly, controversial) evidence that HPAI viruses may be carried for miles from infected farms by the wind. Even without that - quarantines are never 100% effective - which suggests the longer an infected flock is allowed to remain in place, the greater the chances the virus will spread. 

Although there may be a legitimate role for the use of poultry vaccines to protect flocks, their use in other countries hasn't always produced the desired results (see Vaccines: Vaccination and Antiviral Treatment against Avian Influenza H5Nx Viruses (Review Article)). 

While culling is a horrible solution, good alternatives are in short supply.  [Via Avian Flu Diary](https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/02/australia-victoria-reports-3rd-outbreak.html?m=1) ",1itz09j,https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/02/australia-victoria-reports-3rd-outbreak.html?m=1,13
contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1739990453.0,"Canada buys 500,000 doses of H5N1 avian influenza vaccine for those most at risk","The Public Health Agency of Canada said Wednesday it's purchased 500,000 doses of a human vaccine to protect against avian influenza for those most at risk from being exposed to the virus by infected animals.

The agency said it secured the initial supply of GSK's Arepanrix H5N1 A/America vaccine by leveraging an existing agreement.

""While the current risk to the public remains low, individuals with higher-level exposure to infected animals are at increased risk and should take appropriate precautions,"" the agency said in a statement. [...] 

The agency said 60 per cent of available vaccine doses will go to provinces and territories, while the rest will be stockpiled ""for national preparedness."" It falls to provinces and territories to decide whether to deploy vaccines.

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization, Canada's advisory group on vaccines, has also released preliminary guidance on using the vaccine in a non-pandemic context. 

Health officials are watching the pandemic potential of H5N1, as well as other influenza viruses, since when a virus gains the ability to spread easily between humans, it can spark a global pandemic. 

Since April, H5 bird flu has infected nearly 70 people in the United States, with one death. Most of those infections have been among farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cows.

Variants of bird flu, or avian influenza, have also killed hundreds of millions of birds around the globe and are now spreading in non-human mammals. ",1itcyu6,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/h5n1-vaccine-canada-1.7462802,240

Federal officials speaking off the record initially told the Post that the website for ordering the tests would go offline on February 18, but a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman later told the Post that the free test program would remain for now as the government discusses closing the current round of tests. 

Tests to remain in the federal stockpile

The spokesman also said the tests would be kept in the stockpile until they reach their expiration date. Federal officials told the post that only a small fraction of the tests in the government stockpile are expired. 

In late August, federal officials had announced a new round of free at-home tests by mail as a tool to reduce virus spread over the fall and winter respiratory virus season. The offer marked the seventh round of free COVID tests since 2021. At that time, the mail delivery program and year-round access of free tests in settings such as community clinics had delivered more than 1.8 million tests.",1ithe0t,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/hhs-maintain-free-home-covid-tests-mail-now,50

contagioncuriosity,Anti-Owl,1739931149.0,Kennedy says panel will examine childhood vaccine schedule after promising not to change it,"
WASHINGTON (AP) — To earn the vote he needed to become the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a special promise to a U.S. senator: He would not change the nation’s current vaccination schedule.

But on Tuesday, speaking for the first time to thousands of U.S. Health and Human Services agency employees, he vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.

“Nothing is going to be off limits,” Kennedy said, adding that pesticides, food additives, microplastics, antidepressants and the electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones and microwaves also would be studied.

Kennedy’s remarks, which circulated on social media, were delivered during a welcome ceremony for the new health secretary at the agency’s headquarters in Washington as a measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people raged in West Texas. The event was held after a weekend of mass firings of thousands of HHS employees. More dismissals are expected.

In his comments Tuesday, Kennedy promised that a new “Make America Healthy Again” commission would investigate vaccines, pesticides and antidepressants to see if they have contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses such as diabetes and obesity that have plagued the American public. The commission was formed last week in an executive order by Donald Trump immediately after Kennedy was sworn in as the president’s new health secretary.

That directive said the commission will be made up of cabinet members and other officials from the administration and will develop a strategy around children’s health within the next six months. Kennedy said it will investigate issues, including childhood vaccinations, that “were formally taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.”


While Kennedy did not directly call for changes to the vaccination schedule on Tuesday, his plan to investigate it raises questions about his commitment to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana physician who harbored deep misgivings over the health secretary’s anti-vaccine advocacy. Cassidy ultimately voted to send Kennedy’s nomination to the Senate floor after he said Kennedy gave him assurances that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule.

On this topic, the science is good, the science is credible,” Cassidy said during a Senate floor speech earlier this month explaining his vote. “Vaccines save lives. They are safe.”

Rigorous studies of thousands of people followed by decades of real-world use have proven that the vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration for both children and adults safely and effectively prevent diseases.

Cassidy said during his Senate speech last month that Kennedy had made a number of promises that stemmed from “intense conversations” to garner his support. Specifically, Cassidy said Kennedy would “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations without changes.”

Those recommendations are what pediatricians around the country use to decide the safest and most effective ages at which to offer vaccinations to children. The committee meets every year to review the latest data on both old and new vaccines to ensure there are no red flags for safety or other issues before publishing its annual schedule.

When contacted about Kennedy’s remarks, Cassidy’s office did not comment.

Kennedy gained a loyal following for his nonprofit by raising objections to COVID-19 protocols and doubts around the COVID-19 vaccine. Despite his work, Kennedy repeatedly told senators that he was not “anti-vaccine” during his confirmation hearings.

Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious-disease expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who sits on a federal vaccine panel, didn’t believe him.

“I think he will do everything he can to make vaccines less available and less affordable because he’s an anti-vaccine activist,” Offit, who developed the rotavirus vaccine that is on the CDC’s childhood immunization schedule, said last week. 

Kennedy promised staffers on Tuesday during his speech that he would keep an open mind in his new job and asked them to return the favor.

“A lot of times when I read these articles characterizing myself, I think I wouldn’t want to work for that guy, either,” Kennedy said, eliciting some laughs from the crowd. “Let’s start a relationship by letting go of any preconceived perceptions you may have of me.”",1isu9tq,https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0,228
